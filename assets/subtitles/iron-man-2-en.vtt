00:09.309 --> 00:11.602
<i>Been a while since I was up here</i>
<i>in front of you.</i>

00:11.728 --> 00:14.772
<i>Maybe I'll do us all a favour</i>
<i>and just stick to the cards.</i>

00:17.859 --> 00:20.528
<i>There's been speculation that I was</i>
<i>involved in the events that occurred</i>

00:20.653 --> 00:22.030
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop...</i>

00:22.155 --> 00:25.158
<i>Sorry, Mr Stark, do you</i>
<i>honestly expect us to believe that</i>

00:25.283 --> 00:28.828
<i>that was a bodyguard</i>
<i>in a suit that conveniently appeared,</i>

00:28.953 --> 00:31.622
<i>despite the fact</i>
<i>that you sorely despise bodyguards?</i>

00:31.748 --> 00:32.832
<i>Yes.</i>

00:32.957 --> 00:37.587
<i>And this mysterious bodyguard</i>
<i>was somehow equipped</i>

00:37.712 --> 00:41.090
<i>with an undisclosed</i>
<i>Stark high-tech powered battle...</i>

00:41.215 --> 00:43.134
<i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

00:43.259 --> 00:46.763
<i>It is one thing to question the official</i>
<i>story, and another thing entirely</i>

00:46.888 --> 00:50.058
<i>to make wild accusations,</i>
<i>or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

00:53.102 --> 00:56.356
<i>I mean, let's face it,</i>
<i>I'm not the heroic type.</i>

00:56.481 --> 00:58.650
<i>A laundry list of character defects,</i>

00:58.775 --> 01:01.569
<i>all the mistakes I've made,</i>
<i>largely public.</i>

01:01.694 --> 01:03.279
<i>The truth is</i>

01:08.284 --> 01:10.203
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

01:21.047 --> 01:22.173
Ivan.

01:27.428 --> 01:28.846
Vanya.

05:04.604 --> 05:08.149
<i>270 at 30 knots.</i>
<i>Holding steady at 15,000 feet.</i>

05:08.274 --> 05:11.569
<i>You are clear for exfiltration</i>
<i>over the drop zone.</i>

07:05.933 --> 07:10.063
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

07:10.647 --> 07:12.482
It's good to be back.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.152
- You missed me?
- Blow something up!

07:16.277 --> 07:20.406
I missed you, too.
Blow something up? I already did that.

07:20.531 --> 07:23.743
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying

07:23.868 --> 07:27.997
its longest period of uninterrupted peace
in years because of me.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.714
I'm not saying
that from the ashes of captivity,

07:37.382 --> 07:41.844
never has a greater phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

07:44.973 --> 07:50.853
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

07:50.979 --> 07:52.563
sipping on an iced tea

07:52.689 --> 07:55.692
because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough

07:55.817 --> 07:58.653
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.

08:03.074 --> 08:04.283
I love you, Tony!

08:04.409 --> 08:06.494
Please, it's not about me.

08:07.912 --> 08:09.664
It's not about you.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.919
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.756
It's about what we choose
to leave behind for future generations.

08:18.881 --> 08:22.969
And that's why for the next year
and for the first time since 1974,

08:23.094 --> 08:25.471
the best and brightest men and women

08:25.596 --> 08:27.515
of nations and corporations
the world over

08:27.640 --> 08:31.102
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

08:31.227 --> 08:34.230
to leave behind a brighter future.

08:34.355 --> 08:36.065
It's not about us.

08:36.858 --> 08:40.111
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything,

08:40.236 --> 08:42.739
is welcome back to the Stark Expo.

08:46.534 --> 08:49.162
And now,
making a special guest appearance

08:49.287 --> 08:51.664
from the great beyond
to tell you what it's all about,

08:51.789 --> 08:54.250
please welcome my father, Howard.

08:56.627 --> 08:59.547
<i>Everything is achievable</i>
<i>through technology.</i>

08:59.672 --> 09:01.924
<i>Better living, robust health,</i>

09:02.467 --> 09:06.971
<i>and for the first time in human history,</i>
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

09:07.096 --> 09:08.973
<i>So, from all of us here</i>
<i>at Stark Industries,</i>

09:09.098 --> 09:13.853
<i>I would like to personally introduce you</i>
<i>to the City of the Future.</i>

09:13.978 --> 09:17.690
<i>Technology holds infinite possibilities</i>
<i>for mankind,</i>

09:17.815 --> 09:20.610
<i>and will one day rid society of all its ills.</i>

09:20.735 --> 09:24.280
<i>Soon, technology will affect the way</i>
<i>you live your life every day.</i>

09:24.405 --> 09:25.948
<i>No more tedious work,</i>

09:26.282 --> 09:30.662
<i>leaving more time for leisure activities</i>
<i>and enjoying the sweet life.</i>

09:30.787 --> 09:33.498
<i>The Stark Expo. Welcome.</i>

09:38.711 --> 09:41.589
<i>We are coming to you live</i>
<i>from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,</i>

09:41.714 --> 09:44.550
<i>where Tony Stark</i>
<i>has just walked offstage.</i>

09:44.676 --> 09:46.219
<i>Don't worry</i>
<i>if you can't make it down here tonight</i>

09:46.344 --> 09:48.721
<i>because this Expo goes on</i>
<i>all year long.</i>

09:48.846 --> 09:50.807
<i>And I'm gonna be here</i>
<i>checking out all the attractions</i>

09:50.932 --> 09:54.435
<i>and the pavilions and the inventions</i>
<i>from all around the world.</i>

09:54.560 --> 09:56.980
- <i>Make sure you join me...</i>
- All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.

09:57.105 --> 09:59.899
- Open up, let's go.
- Hey! Nice to see you.

10:00.024 --> 10:02.527
- All right. Thank you. I remember you.
- Tony, Tony...

10:02.652 --> 10:04.153
Hey, hey...

10:04.278 --> 10:06.698
- Call me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.242
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

10:09.367 --> 10:10.827
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.

10:10.952 --> 10:11.995
This is Larry.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.163
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

10:14.288 --> 10:15.748
- Nice to see you.
- Call me. Call me.

10:15.873 --> 10:17.625
- Larry King.
- Larry!

10:18.126 --> 10:20.461
Yes, my people, my people.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.088
Come on, Tony. There we go.

10:22.213 --> 10:24.048
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

10:24.173 --> 10:25.425
No, it was perfect.

10:25.550 --> 10:27.010
Look what we got here, the new model.

10:27.135 --> 10:28.803
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

10:28.928 --> 10:29.971
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.222
- And you are?
- Marshal.

10:31.347 --> 10:33.266
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

10:33.391 --> 10:35.518
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

10:35.643 --> 10:36.811
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

10:36.936 --> 10:39.605
- Looking for you.
- Yeah? You found me.

10:41.107 --> 10:44.193
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

10:46.696 --> 10:47.822
He doesn't like to be handed things.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.490
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

10:49.615 --> 10:50.700
You are hereby ordered

10:50.825 --> 10:53.036
to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

10:53.161 --> 10:54.787
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

10:54.912 --> 10:56.456
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

10:56.581 --> 10:58.833
He likes the badge.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.960
- You still like it?
- Yep.

11:03.087 --> 11:06.507
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.? 250 miles.

11:09.260 --> 11:15.141
<i>Mr Stark, could we pick up now</i>
<i>where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.</i>

11:15.266 --> 11:16.809
- <i>Yes, dear?</i>
- <i>Can I have your attention?</i>

11:16.934 --> 11:17.977
<i>Absolutely.</i>

11:18.102 --> 11:21.022
<i>Do you or do you not possess</i>
<i>a specialised weapon?</i>

11:21.147 --> 11:23.399
- <i>I do not. I do not.</i>
- <i>You do not?</i>

11:23.566 --> 11:25.985
<i>Well, it depends</i>
<i>on how you define the word "weapon."</i>

11:26.110 --> 11:28.738
- <i>The Iron Man weapon.</i>
- <i>My device does not fit that description.</i>

11:28.863 --> 11:30.531
<i>Well... How would you describe it?</i>

11:30.657 --> 11:33.660
<i>I would describe it by defining it</i>
<i>as what it is, Senator.</i>

11:33.785 --> 11:37.538
- <i>As?</i>
- <i>It's a high-tech prosthesis.</i>

11:37.664 --> 11:38.665
<i>That is... That is...</i>

11:38.790 --> 11:41.042
<i>That's actually the most apt description</i>
<i>I can make of it.</i>

11:41.167 --> 11:43.002
<i>It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr Stark.</i>

11:43.127 --> 11:46.172
<i>Please, if your priority was actually</i>
<i>the well-being of the American citizen...</i>

11:46.297 --> 11:49.133
<i>My priority is to get the Iron Man</i>
<i>weapon turned over to the people</i>

11:49.258 --> 11:52.595
- <i>of the United States of America.</i>
- <i>Well, you can forget it.</i>

11:53.179 --> 11:56.933
<i>I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.</i>

11:57.058 --> 11:59.477
<i>To turn over the Iron Man suit</i>
<i>would be to turn over myself,</i>

11:59.602 --> 12:02.563
<i>which is tantamount</i>
<i>to indentured servitude or prostitution,</i>

12:02.689 --> 12:04.315
<i>depending on what state you're in.</i>

12:04.440 --> 12:07.360
- <i>You can't have it.</i>
- <i>Look, I'm no expert...</i>

12:07.485 --> 12:11.239
<i>In prostitution? Of course not.</i>
<i>You're a senator. Come on.</i>

12:12.198 --> 12:14.659
<i>I'm no expert in weapons.</i>

12:14.784 --> 12:16.536
<i>We have somebody here</i>
<i>who is an expert on weapons.</i>

12:16.703 --> 12:21.416
<i>I'd now like to call Justin Hammer,</i>
<i>our current primary weapons contractor.</i>

12:22.458 --> 12:25.920
<i>Let the record reflect that I observed</i>
<i>Mr Hammer entering the chamber,</i>

12:26.045 --> 12:27.338
<i>and I am wondering</i>

12:27.463 --> 12:31.175
<i>if and when any actual expert</i>
<i>will also be in attendance.</i>

12:35.138 --> 12:39.434
<i>Absolutely. I'm no expert.</i>
<i>I defer to you, Anthony.</i>

12:39.559 --> 12:41.519
<i>You're the wonder boy.</i>

12:41.644 --> 12:43.730
<i>Senator, if I may.</i>

12:43.855 --> 12:48.276
<i>I may well not be an expert,</i>
<i>but you know who was the expert?</i>

12:48.401 --> 12:50.987
<i>Your dad. Howard Stark.</i>

12:51.112 --> 12:55.491
<i>Really a father to us all,</i>
<i>and to the military-industrial age.</i>

12:56.117 --> 13:00.621
<i>Let's just be clear.</i>
<i>He was no flower child. He was a lion.</i>

13:00.747 --> 13:03.124
<i>We all know why we're here.</i>
<i>In the last six months,</i>

13:03.249 --> 13:07.337
<i>Anthony Stark has created a sword</i>
<i>with untold possibilities.</i>

13:07.462 --> 13:10.256
<i>And yet he insists it's a shield.</i>

13:10.381 --> 13:14.969
<i>He asks us to trust him</i>
<i>as we cower behind it.</i>

13:15.094 --> 13:18.306
<i>I wish I were comforted, Anthony,</i>
<i>I really do.</i>

13:18.431 --> 13:21.517
<i>I'd love to leave my door unlocked</i>
<i>when I leave the house,</i>

13:21.643 --> 13:23.061
<i>but this ain't Canada.</i>

13:23.186 --> 13:24.812
<i>You know, we live in a world</i>
<i>of grave threats,</i>

13:24.937 --> 13:28.650
<i>threats that Mr Stark</i>
<i>will not always be able to foresee.</i>

13:29.776 --> 13:31.152
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:31.277 --> 13:33.988
<i>God bless Iron Man. God bless America.</i>

13:35.114 --> 13:37.200
<i>That is well said, Mr Hammer.</i>

13:37.325 --> 13:39.243
<i>The committee would now like to invite</i>

13:39.369 --> 13:42.455
<i>Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes</i>
<i>to the chamber.</i>

13:42.580 --> 13:44.040
<i>Rhodey? What?</i>

13:50.421 --> 13:53.633
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.

13:53.758 --> 13:56.344
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.512
I just...

13:57.637 --> 13:59.013
- Drop it.
- All right, I'll drop it.

13:59.138 --> 14:02.600
<i>I have before me a complete report</i>
<i>on the Iron Man weapon,</i>

14:02.725 --> 14:05.353
<i>compiled by Colonel Rhodes.</i>
<i>And, Colonel, for the record,</i>

14:05.478 --> 14:08.564
<i>can you please read page 57,</i>
<i>paragraph four?</i>

14:08.690 --> 14:10.942
<i>You're requesting</i>
<i>that I read specific selections</i>

14:11.067 --> 14:12.318
- <i>from my report, Senator?</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

14:12.443 --> 14:14.320
<i>It was my understanding</i>
<i>that I was going to be testifying</i>

14:14.445 --> 14:16.572
<i>in a much more comprehensive</i>
<i>and detailed manner.</i>

14:16.698 --> 14:18.282
<i>I understand.</i>
<i>A lot of things have changed today.</i>

14:18.408 --> 14:19.659
- <i>So if you could just read...</i>
- <i>You do understand</i>

14:19.784 --> 14:22.161
<i>that reading a single paragraph</i>
<i>out of context does not reflect</i>

14:22.286 --> 14:25.498
- <i>the summary of my final...</i>
- <i>Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.</i>

14:26.624 --> 14:27.959
<i>Very well.</i>

14:29.961 --> 14:33.214
<i>"As he does not operate within</i>
<i>any definable branch of government,</i>

14:35.216 --> 14:39.304
<i>"Iron Man presents a potential threat</i>
<i>to the security of both the nation</i>

14:39.429 --> 14:40.805
<i>"and to her interests."</i>

14:40.930 --> 14:42.765
<i>I did, however, go on to summarise</i>

14:42.890 --> 14:45.560
<i>that the benefits of Iron Man</i>
<i>far outweigh the liabilities.</i>

14:45.685 --> 14:47.812
- <i>And that it would be in our interest...</i>
- <i>That's enough, Colonel.</i>

14:47.937 --> 14:49.063
- <i>... to fold Mr Stark...</i>
- <i>That's enough.</i>

14:49.188 --> 14:50.690
<i>... into the existing</i>
<i>chain of command, Senator.</i>

14:50.815 --> 14:54.152
<i>I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider</i>
<i>Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.</i>

14:54.277 --> 14:56.863
<i>We can amend the hours a little bit.</i>

14:57.613 --> 14:59.324
<i>I'd like to go on and show, if I may,</i>

14:59.449 --> 15:01.576
<i>the imagery</i>
<i>that's connected to your report.</i>

15:01.701 --> 15:04.537
<i>I believe it is somewhat premature</i>
<i>to reveal these images</i>

15:04.662 --> 15:06.414
- <i>to the general public at this time.</i>
- <i>With all due respect,</i>

15:06.539 --> 15:07.707
<i>Colonel, I understand.</i>

15:07.832 --> 15:11.878
<i>And if you could just narrate those</i>
<i>for us, we'd be very grateful.</i>

15:12.003 --> 15:13.880
Let's have the images.

15:15.381 --> 15:18.593
<i>Intelligence suggests</i>
<i>that the devices seen in these photos</i>

15:18.718 --> 15:21.554
<i>are, in fact, attempts</i>
<i>at making manned copies</i>

15:21.679 --> 15:23.097
<i>of Mr Stark's suit.</i>

15:23.222 --> 15:28.227
<i>This has been corroborated by our allies</i>
<i>and local intelligence on the ground,</i>

15:28.353 --> 15:33.441
<i>indicating that these suits are quite</i>
<i>possibly, at this moment, operational.</i>

15:33.900 --> 15:37.528
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

15:38.154 --> 15:41.074
Boy, I'm good.
I commandeered your screens.

15:41.824 --> 15:44.619
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.621
- <i>Now, let's see what's really going on.</i>
- <i>What is he doing?</i>

15:46.746 --> 15:49.957
<i>If you will direct your attention</i>
<i>to said screens...</i>

15:50.083 --> 15:51.626
<i>I believe that's North Korea.</i>

15:59.884 --> 16:02.720
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

16:02.845 --> 16:03.972
Iran.

16:07.475 --> 16:11.479
No grave immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?

16:12.188 --> 16:14.023
How did Hammer get in the game?

16:14.857 --> 16:16.734
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

16:17.485 --> 16:21.280
<i>Okay, give me a left twist.</i>
<i>Left's good. Turn to the right.</i>

16:23.741 --> 16:26.452
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, shit!</i>

16:26.577 --> 16:27.704
Wow.

16:28.663 --> 16:32.458
Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, 10 years away.

16:32.583 --> 16:33.835
Hammer Industries, 20.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.546
<i>I'd like to point out</i>
<i>that that test pilot survived.</i>

16:36.671 --> 16:38.172
<i>I think we're done,</i>
<i>is the point that he's making.</i>

16:38.298 --> 16:41.467
- <i>I don't think there's any reason...</i>
- <i>The point is, you're welcome, I guess.</i>

16:41.592 --> 16:44.387
- <i>For what?</i>
- <i>Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.</i>

16:44.554 --> 16:47.015
<i>It's working.</i>
<i>We're safe. America is secure.</i>

16:47.140 --> 16:49.017
<i>You want my property?</i>
<i>You can't have it.</i>

16:49.142 --> 16:50.476
<i>But I did you a big favour.</i>

16:51.311 --> 16:54.147
I've successfully privatised world peace.

16:57.025 --> 16:59.569
What more do you want? For now!

17:00.653 --> 17:03.239
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

17:03.364 --> 17:06.701
<i>... you, Mr Stark... you, buddy.</i>

17:06.993 --> 17:08.911
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.

17:09.037 --> 17:11.289
- Okay.
- You've been a delight.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.380
<i>My bond is with the people.</i>

17:19.505 --> 17:24.677
<i>And I will serve this great nation</i>
<i>at the pleasure of myself.</i>

17:25.053 --> 17:26.387
<i>If there's one thing I've proven</i>

17:26.512 --> 17:29.807
<i>it's that you can count on me</i>
<i>to pleasure myself.</i>

18:05.551 --> 18:07.011
Wake up. Daddy's home.

18:07.136 --> 18:08.680
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

18:08.805 --> 18:10.640
<i>Congratulations on</i>
<i>the opening ceremonies.</i>

18:10.765 --> 18:13.768
<i>They were such a success,</i>
<i>as was your Senate hearing.</i>

18:13.893 --> 18:15.603
<i>And may I say how refreshing it is</i>

18:15.728 --> 18:19.440
<i>to finally see you in a video</i>
<i>with your clothing on, sir.</i>

18:21.401 --> 18:22.485
You!

18:23.111 --> 18:25.279
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.949
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

18:28.533 --> 18:30.702
How many ounces a day
of this gobbledegook

18:30.827 --> 18:31.869
am I supposed to drink?

18:31.995 --> 18:35.915
<i>We are up to 80 ounces a day</i>
<i>to counteract the symptoms, sir.</i>

18:36.916 --> 18:38.876
Check palladium levels.

18:40.837 --> 18:43.131
<i>Blood toxicity, 24%.</i>

18:44.632 --> 18:46.968
<i>It appears that the continued use</i>
<i>of the Iron Man suit</i>

18:47.093 --> 18:49.429
<i>is accelerating your condition.</i>

18:51.014 --> 18:53.349
<i>Another core has been depleted.</i>

18:56.811 --> 18:58.396
God, they're running out quick.

18:58.521 --> 19:01.149
<i>I have run simulations</i>
<i>on every known element,</i>

19:01.274 --> 19:03.276
<i>and none can serve</i>
<i>as a viable replacement</i>

19:03.401 --> 19:05.361
<i>for the palladium core.</i>

19:07.613 --> 19:10.658
<i>You are running out of both time</i>
<i>and options.</i>

19:14.412 --> 19:17.081
<i>Unfortunately, the device</i>
<i>that's keeping you alive</i>

19:17.206 --> 19:19.000
<i>is also killing you.</i>

19:20.543 --> 19:21.919
<i>Miss Potts is approaching.</i>

19:22.045 --> 19:24.922
- <i>I recommend that you inform her...</i>
- Mute.

19:28.051 --> 19:29.594
Is this a joke?

19:31.012 --> 19:32.680
- What are you thinking?
- What?

19:32.805 --> 19:35.058
- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

19:35.183 --> 19:37.477
And you're angry about something.

19:37.602 --> 19:38.936
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

19:39.062 --> 19:40.438
- Did you just donate...
- Keep your business.

19:40.563 --> 19:44.067
...our entire modern art collection
to the...

19:44.192 --> 19:45.777
- Boy Scouts of America.
...Boy Scouts of America?

19:45.902 --> 19:47.654
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.

19:47.779 --> 19:51.115
I didn't physically check the crates
but, basically, yes.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.368
And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No offence.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.495
No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled

19:55.620 --> 19:57.163
to say "our" collection

19:57.288 --> 20:00.458
considering the time that I put in,
over 10 years,

20:00.583 --> 20:02.377
- curating that.
- It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.546
You know,
there's only about 8,011 things

20:05.672 --> 20:07.590
that I really need to talk to you about.

20:07.715 --> 20:09.133
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

20:09.258 --> 20:10.677
The Bridgeport's
already machining that part.

20:10.802 --> 20:13.137
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

20:13.262 --> 20:15.473
I need you to wear a surgical mask
until you're feeling better.

20:15.598 --> 20:16.599
- Is that okay?
- That's rude.

20:16.724 --> 20:18.184
There's nothing more important to me
than the Expo.

20:18.309 --> 20:19.602
It's my primary point of concern.

20:19.727 --> 20:22.855
- I don't know why you're...
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

20:22.981 --> 20:24.691
Wow. Look at that.

20:25.984 --> 20:28.319
That's modern art. That's going up.

20:28.444 --> 20:31.155
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.449
- This is vital.
- Stark is in complete disarray.

20:33.574 --> 20:35.868
- You understand that?
- No. Our stocks have never been higher.

20:35.994 --> 20:38.287
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,

20:38.413 --> 20:39.872
- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.

20:39.998 --> 20:41.541
- Let's move on to another subject.
- No, no, no, no.

20:41.666 --> 20:43.334
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman

20:43.459 --> 20:44.919
- and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.254
I'm just replacing it with this.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.714
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

20:47.839 --> 20:50.925
My point is,
we have already awarded contracts

20:51.050 --> 20:52.677
- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

20:52.802 --> 20:54.846
- I'm already feeling gassy.
- And to the plastic plantation tree,

20:54.971 --> 20:57.056
which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...

20:57.181 --> 20:58.933
- Everything was my idea.
...and you won't make a decision.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.727
I don't care
about the liberal agenda any more.

21:00.852 --> 21:03.187
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

21:03.313 --> 21:05.565
- You do it.
- I do what?

21:05.690 --> 21:07.608
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.486
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

21:10.611 --> 21:11.988
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

21:12.113 --> 21:13.740
- give me the information...
- I'm not asking you to try...

21:13.865 --> 21:14.949
...in order to...
- I'm asking you

21:15.074 --> 21:16.242
to physically do it. I need you to do it.

21:16.367 --> 21:18.077
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

21:18.202 --> 21:20.079
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.

21:20.204 --> 21:22.040
Why won't you let me?

21:22.623 --> 21:25.585
- Have you been drinking?
- Chlorophyll.

21:27.545 --> 21:31.758
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

21:31.883 --> 21:33.760
effective immediately.

21:35.970 --> 21:37.847
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

21:39.349 --> 21:41.893
I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought,

21:42.018 --> 21:45.897
believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

21:46.189 --> 21:49.859
trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.

21:49.984 --> 21:51.736
And then I realised

21:54.322 --> 21:56.824
it's you. It's always been you.

21:58.868 --> 21:59.952
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

22:00.078 --> 22:03.498
but actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.

22:04.248 --> 22:06.209
My successor being you.

22:08.419 --> 22:10.046
Congratulations?

22:11.839 --> 22:13.383
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

22:13.508 --> 22:15.259
Don't think. Drink.

22:19.597 --> 22:21.099
There you go.

23:02.515 --> 23:05.727
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

23:06.019 --> 23:07.729
I'm on happy time.

23:13.985 --> 23:15.194
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

23:15.320 --> 23:17.697
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

23:17.822 --> 23:19.866
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

23:19.991 --> 23:22.410
All right, put them up. Come on.

23:25.121 --> 23:29.959
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.546
I need you to initial each box.

23:34.172 --> 23:36.883
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...

23:39.218 --> 23:40.386
That's it. I'm done.

23:40.511 --> 23:42.889
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

23:43.014 --> 23:44.557
Front and centre. Come into the church.

23:44.682 --> 23:48.436
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
- lf it pleases the court, which it does.

23:48.561 --> 23:51.856
- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

24:05.453 --> 24:06.579
What?

24:10.375 --> 24:13.127
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

24:13.419 --> 24:15.380
- Pepper.
- What?

24:16.506 --> 24:18.716
- Who is she?
- She is from legal.

24:18.841 --> 24:22.887
And she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit

24:23.012 --> 24:25.139
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.

24:25.264 --> 24:28.017
Yes, and I've got
three excellent potential candidates.

24:28.184 --> 24:29.644
They're lined up and ready to meet you.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.605
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.

24:32.730 --> 24:33.773
No, it's not.

24:33.898 --> 24:35.650
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

24:35.775 --> 24:39.696
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot
Camp? Crunch? Something like that?

24:39.821 --> 24:43.533
- How do I spell your name, Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

24:43.658 --> 24:48.037
- What, are you gonna google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

24:48.162 --> 24:51.791
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
- You're so predictable, you know that?

24:51.916 --> 24:54.043
She's fluent in French, Italian,
Russian, Latin.

24:54.168 --> 24:56.004
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

24:56.129 --> 24:58.381
- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.

24:58.506 --> 25:00.258
You can read Latin
or you can write Latin,

25:00.383 --> 25:01.926
- but you can't speak Latin...
- Did you model in Tokyo?

25:02.051 --> 25:03.761
- 'Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
- Well...

25:03.886 --> 25:05.221
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.

25:05.346 --> 25:08.933
Rule number one,
never take your eye off your opponent.

25:10.184 --> 25:11.561
Oh, my God!

25:13.855 --> 25:16.566
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

25:16.691 --> 25:17.984
- I just slipped.
- You did?

25:18.109 --> 25:20.403
- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.

25:22.780 --> 25:24.949
Just... I need your impression.

25:25.074 --> 25:27.744
You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.

25:27.869 --> 25:30.330
- I meant your fingerprint.
- Right.

25:33.207 --> 25:36.711
- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

25:38.004 --> 25:41.174
- You're the boss.
- Will that be all, Mr Stark?

25:41.299 --> 25:43.217
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.

25:43.343 --> 25:45.136
Thank you very much.

25:48.181 --> 25:49.807
- I want one.
- No.

26:23.758 --> 26:26.094
You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,

26:26.219 --> 26:27.428
- just go with it.
- Go with it? Go with what?

26:27.553 --> 26:29.055
- Mr Stark?
- Hey.

26:29.180 --> 26:30.348
Hello. How was your flight?

26:30.473 --> 26:31.933
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.

26:32.058 --> 26:36.187
We have one photographer
from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

26:36.312 --> 26:38.356
- When did this happen?
- What? You made me do it.

26:38.481 --> 26:40.984
- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile. Look right there.

26:41.109 --> 26:42.193
Stop acting constipated.

26:42.318 --> 26:43.736
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

26:43.861 --> 26:44.862
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

26:44.988 --> 26:46.656
- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.

26:46.781 --> 26:48.574
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

26:48.700 --> 26:50.576
You have a 9:30 dinner.

26:50.702 --> 26:52.412
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00.
- Absolutely.

26:52.537 --> 26:54.330
- Is this us?
- It can be.

26:54.455 --> 26:56.082
- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.

26:56.207 --> 26:58.626
- Mr Musk. How are you?
- Hi, Pepper.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.586
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

27:00.712 --> 27:02.922
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

27:03.047 --> 27:05.008
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea
for an electric jet.

27:05.133 --> 27:06.175
- You do?
- Yeah.

27:06.301 --> 27:08.303
Then we'll make it work.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.138
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No,

27:10.263 --> 27:11.681
- I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...

27:11.806 --> 27:13.182
- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.

27:13.308 --> 27:14.434
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

27:14.559 --> 27:15.643
Thank you very much.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.687
- Green is not your best colour.
- Oh, please.

27:17.812 --> 27:19.314
Anthony! Is that you?

27:19.439 --> 27:20.690
- My least favourite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.

27:20.815 --> 27:22.066
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

27:22.191 --> 27:24.944
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

27:25.069 --> 27:27.447
You know Christine Everhart
from <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

27:27.572 --> 27:28.656
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

27:28.781 --> 27:29.991
- Yes.
- Yes.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.242
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

27:31.367 --> 27:35.371
BTW, big story.
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

27:35.496 --> 27:36.748
- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.

27:36.873 --> 27:40.293
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

27:40.418 --> 27:41.544
- Can I?
- Sure.

27:41.669 --> 27:44.130
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

27:44.255 --> 27:46.132
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

27:46.257 --> 27:47.300
- Right.
- Right?

27:47.425 --> 27:50.762
Well, she did quite a spread
on Tony last year.

27:50.887 --> 27:52.180
And she wrote a story as well.

27:52.305 --> 27:54.307
- It was very impressive.
- That was good.

27:54.432 --> 27:56.434
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

27:56.559 --> 27:57.977
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

27:58.102 --> 27:59.520
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.

27:59.646 --> 28:00.897
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

28:01.022 --> 28:03.608
- Can I ask you... Is this the first time...
- <i>Fromage.</i>

28:03.733 --> 28:05.193
- Say, "Brie."
...that you guys have seen each other?

28:05.318 --> 28:07.528
God, that's so awful.

28:07.654 --> 28:09.989
Listen, is it the first time you've seen
each other since the Senate?

28:10.114 --> 28:11.741
Since he got his contract revoked...

28:11.866 --> 28:14.035
- Actually, it's on hold.
...when you were attempting to...

28:14.160 --> 28:16.120
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"

28:16.245 --> 28:18.039
- and "cancelled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?

28:18.164 --> 28:20.500
No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?

28:20.625 --> 28:24.587
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

28:24.712 --> 28:27.048
Well, if you invent something
that works,

28:27.173 --> 28:28.549
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

28:28.675 --> 28:30.843
- Mr Stark, your corner table is ready.
- Yes?

28:30.969 --> 28:33.137
I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.

28:33.262 --> 28:36.391
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.

28:37.308 --> 28:38.434
We kid. We're kidders.

29:00.832 --> 29:02.834
Got any other bad ideas?

29:07.088 --> 29:08.214
Tony!

29:12.093 --> 29:16.347
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

29:16.472 --> 29:18.891
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

29:19.017 --> 29:21.477
for Hammer Industries, you know?

29:21.602 --> 29:24.897
- Everything that Tony and I do...
- <i>Well, what's the use of having...</i>

29:25.023 --> 29:27.859
...is a healthy...
- <i>... and owning a race car...</i>

29:27.984 --> 29:30.903
...competition.
- <i>... if you don't drive it?</i>

29:31.988 --> 29:33.489
Is he driving?

29:40.788 --> 29:42.457
Natalie. Natalie!

29:43.416 --> 29:44.584
- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?

29:44.709 --> 29:46.878
This is the first that I have known of it.

29:47.587 --> 29:48.713
This... This cannot happen.

29:48.838 --> 29:50.465
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

29:50.590 --> 29:51.799
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.760
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

29:54.552 --> 29:56.638
Tony's... You know, he...

29:56.763 --> 29:58.598
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

29:58.723 --> 29:59.766
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

29:59.891 --> 30:02.810
- can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.103
- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.

30:04.228 --> 30:05.438
But I have to make one quick phone call.

30:05.563 --> 30:06.606
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

30:06.731 --> 30:08.066
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

30:08.191 --> 30:09.651
- I'll be right back.
- Look!

30:09.776 --> 30:11.235
That's Stark.

32:09.270 --> 32:10.480
Go, go!

32:14.108 --> 32:15.360
Hang on.

33:24.345 --> 33:26.139
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

33:26.264 --> 33:27.807
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

33:27.932 --> 33:29.058
Car!

34:32.747 --> 34:34.123
Oh, my God!

34:40.755 --> 34:43.257
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:44.133 --> 34:46.260
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

34:46.386 --> 34:48.346
- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

34:48.471 --> 34:50.390
- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!

34:50.515 --> 34:52.225
I was attacked! We need better security.

34:52.350 --> 34:54.560
- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.

34:54.686 --> 34:56.396
God, it's embarrassing.

34:57.271 --> 34:59.482
First vacation in two years.

35:04.195 --> 35:05.571
Oh, my God!

35:06.698 --> 35:08.908
- I got him!
- Hit him again. Hit him again.

35:09.033 --> 35:10.868
Football.

35:13.371 --> 35:15.373
- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!

35:15.498 --> 35:17.125
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

35:17.250 --> 35:19.043
Stop banging the car!

35:22.213 --> 35:23.548
Calm down.

35:24.507 --> 35:26.467
God! God!

35:29.095 --> 35:31.806
Give me the case! Please! Come on!

37:04.232 --> 37:05.858
You... You lose.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.826
You lose. You lose, Stark.

38:08.421 --> 38:12.050
Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.

38:17.847 --> 38:20.725
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

38:23.478 --> 38:26.189
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionised plasma channels.

38:26.314 --> 38:29.192
It's effective. Not very efficient.

38:30.276 --> 38:32.570
But it's a passable knock-off.

38:33.529 --> 38:34.781
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,

38:34.906 --> 38:36.658
you could have made a solid paycheck.

38:36.783 --> 38:40.912
You could have sold it
to North Korea, China, Iran,

38:41.037 --> 38:43.623
or gone right to the black market.

38:43.748 --> 38:46.668
You look like you got friends
in low places.

38:46.793 --> 38:52.298
You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.

38:53.716 --> 38:55.969
And now, like all guilty men,

38:56.928 --> 38:59.514
you try to rewrite your own history.

39:00.223 --> 39:05.186
And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.

39:06.396 --> 39:09.607
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

39:09.732 --> 39:12.610
My father. Anton Vanko.

39:13.861 --> 39:15.989
Well, I never heard of him.

39:17.115 --> 39:19.784
My father is the reason you're alive.

39:20.076 --> 39:22.036
The reason I'm alive
is 'cause you had a shot, you took it,

39:22.161 --> 39:23.663
you missed.

39:23.788 --> 39:24.956
Did I?

39:27.875 --> 39:29.961
If you can make God bleed,

39:31.004 --> 39:33.840
the people will cease to believe in him.

39:35.216 --> 39:39.512
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

39:41.556 --> 39:45.935
The truth,
all I have to do is sit here and watch

39:46.060 --> 39:48.521
as the world will consume you.

39:48.646 --> 39:50.690
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

39:50.815 --> 39:54.694
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

39:54.819 --> 39:57.071
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

39:57.196 --> 40:00.533
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

40:18.009 --> 40:21.429
<i>It's just unbelievable. It proves</i>
<i>that the genie is out of the bottle</i>

40:21.554 --> 40:23.973
<i>and this man has no idea</i>
<i>what he's doing.</i>

40:24.098 --> 40:27.810
<i>He thinks of the Iron Man weapon</i>
<i>as a toy.</i>

40:27.935 --> 40:32.732
<i>I was at a hearing</i>
<i>where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant</i>

40:32.857 --> 40:36.444
<i>that these suits</i>
<i>can't exist anywhere else,</i>

40:36.569 --> 40:39.072
<i>don't exist anywhere else,</i>
<i>never will exist anywhere else,</i>

40:39.197 --> 40:40.490
<i>at least for five to 10 years,</i>

40:40.615 --> 40:45.203
<i>and here we are in Monaco realising,</i>
<i>"These suits exist now."</i>

40:45.328 --> 40:46.454
Mute.

40:48.790 --> 40:52.043
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

40:55.630 --> 40:59.384
- What is that?
- This is your in-flight meal.

41:02.428 --> 41:04.555
Did you just make that?

41:04.681 --> 41:08.059
Yeah. Where do you think I've been
for three hours?

41:09.102 --> 41:10.228
Tony,

41:12.438 --> 41:14.649
what are you not telling me?

41:18.611 --> 41:21.572
I don't want to go home. At all.

41:23.866 --> 41:26.536
Let's cancel my birthday party and...

41:26.661 --> 41:29.205
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

41:29.330 --> 41:30.498
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

41:30.623 --> 41:32.458
It's a great place to

41:35.003 --> 41:38.089
- be healthy.
- I don't think this is the right time.

41:38.214 --> 41:40.425
We're in kind of a mess.

41:40.550 --> 41:42.135
Yeah, but maybe that's why
it's the best time.

41:42.260 --> 41:44.262
- 'Cause then we...
- Well, I think as the CEO,

41:44.387 --> 41:45.471
I need to show up.

41:45.596 --> 41:49.851
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

41:49.976 --> 41:51.269
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

41:51.394 --> 41:53.896
- A retreat? During a time like this?
- Just a ride.

41:54.022 --> 41:57.567
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

41:57.692 --> 42:00.403
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

44:12.410 --> 44:14.495
Hey, there he is.

44:15.246 --> 44:16.664
There he is.

44:18.625 --> 44:21.753
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.

44:22.879 --> 44:23.880
Oh, goodness gracious.

44:24.005 --> 44:27.508
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

44:27.634 --> 44:31.095
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

44:31.220 --> 44:34.974
I didn't want to make
a first impression like this.

44:35.099 --> 44:37.310
He's not an animal. Come on.

44:38.269 --> 44:40.897
He's a human being. Thank you.

44:45.985 --> 44:47.362
We're fine.

44:49.030 --> 44:50.698
My name is Justin Hammer.

44:50.823 --> 44:54.118
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.

44:57.872 --> 45:00.333
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?

45:00.458 --> 45:03.753
- We have some salmon carpaccio.
- Salmon carpaccio.

45:05.254 --> 45:07.048
Anything you want here, we got it.

45:07.173 --> 45:11.219
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in from San Francisco.

45:11.344 --> 45:13.179
It's Italian, though.

45:13.304 --> 45:15.056
Organic ice cream.

45:15.181 --> 45:19.060
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

45:21.020 --> 45:23.773
What I saw you do to Tony Stark
on that track,

45:23.898 --> 45:27.527
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

45:27.652 --> 45:29.737
that was... Wow!

45:29.862 --> 45:31.364
You spoke to me with what you did.

45:31.489 --> 45:34.075
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

45:34.200 --> 45:35.702
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off

45:35.827 --> 45:38.579
to God knows where. It would have been
such a waste of talent.

45:38.705 --> 45:39.998
But if I might make a suggestion,

45:40.123 --> 45:42.792
you know,
you don't just go and try and kill the guy.

45:42.917 --> 45:47.130
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.

45:47.255 --> 45:49.299
That's what you kill.

45:49.424 --> 45:52.385
You and me,
we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

45:52.510 --> 45:57.098
The only difference between you and I
is that I have resources.

45:57.974 --> 46:00.351
I think, if I may,

46:00.476 --> 46:02.770
you need my resources.

46:02.895 --> 46:05.440
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

46:05.565 --> 46:07.567
I'd like to be that guy.

46:19.537 --> 46:23.791
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

46:23.916 --> 46:26.711
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

46:26.836 --> 46:28.212
Very good, man.

46:28.338 --> 46:31.466
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

46:31.591 --> 46:32.675
Hey!

46:34.260 --> 46:36.387
- Hey.
- Yes?

46:36.512 --> 46:38.056
I want my bird.

46:40.099 --> 46:43.728
- A bird? You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

46:43.853 --> 46:45.480
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

46:45.605 --> 46:47.106
I want my bird.

46:47.231 --> 46:49.734
Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible. I could...

46:49.859 --> 46:53.488
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird back in Russia?

46:53.613 --> 46:56.616
Yes, but the fundamentals
of the company are still very, very strong

46:56.741 --> 46:58.618
- despite the events in Monaco.
- Yes, of course.

46:58.743 --> 47:02.163
- The AP wants a quote.
- Don't tell him. Fax them...

47:02.288 --> 47:03.748
Where is he?

47:03.873 --> 47:05.625
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
- He's downstairs.

47:05.750 --> 47:07.168
- <i>... what happened in Monaco?</i>
- Yes, but...

47:07.293 --> 47:09.754
<i>But his continuing erratic behaviour</i>

47:09.879 --> 47:11.965
<i>may lead many people</i>
<i>to ask themselves,</i>

47:12.090 --> 47:13.883
<i>"Can this man still protect us?"</i>

47:14.008 --> 47:17.261
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.

47:18.596 --> 47:22.934
<i>Query complete, sir.</i>
<i>Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist</i>

47:23.059 --> 47:26.020
<i>who defected to the United States</i>
<i>in 1963.</i>

47:26.145 --> 47:30.274
<i>However, he was accused of espionage</i>
<i>and was deported in 1967.</i>

47:30.400 --> 47:32.735
<i>His son, lvan, who is also a physicist,</i>

47:32.860 --> 47:37.573
<i>was convicted of selling Soviet-era</i>
<i>weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,</i>

47:37.699 --> 47:40.159
<i>and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.</i>

47:40.285 --> 47:42.328
<i>No further records exist.</i>

47:46.958 --> 47:48.543
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

47:48.668 --> 47:50.878
and get on top
of this situation right now.

47:51.004 --> 47:55.216
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

47:55.341 --> 47:58.136
trying to talk them out
of rolling tanks up the PCH,

47:58.261 --> 48:01.097
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

48:01.222 --> 48:03.224
They're gonna take your suits,
Tony, okay?

48:03.349 --> 48:05.226
They're sick of the games.

48:05.351 --> 48:08.521
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

48:08.646 --> 48:11.816
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.

48:11.941 --> 48:14.235
It's not theoretical any more.

48:15.486 --> 48:17.488
Are you listening to me?

48:19.657 --> 48:22.744
- Are you okay?
- Let's go.

48:25.663 --> 48:28.166
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

48:30.543 --> 48:33.880
- You all right?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

48:34.005 --> 48:36.090
- See that cigar box?
- Yeah.

48:36.507 --> 48:38.051
It's palladium.

48:45.141 --> 48:46.559
Is that supposed to be smoking?

48:46.684 --> 48:50.897
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.

48:54.692 --> 48:56.778
You had this in your body?

49:01.658 --> 49:05.453
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

49:05.578 --> 49:06.913
Road rash.

49:10.375 --> 49:11.709
Thank you.

49:23.179 --> 49:26.641
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

49:26.766 --> 49:29.769
You wanna do
this whole lone gunslinger act

49:29.894 --> 49:31.896
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

49:32.021 --> 49:34.190
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

49:34.315 --> 49:36.526
But you've gotta trust me.

49:36.651 --> 49:40.405
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

49:49.205 --> 49:51.457
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

49:51.582 --> 49:55.003
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?

49:55.128 --> 49:56.504
No pressure.

49:56.629 --> 49:59.590
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

49:59.716 --> 50:01.134
I may have done a few miscalculations

50:01.259 --> 50:03.219
and rushed the prototype
into production.

50:03.344 --> 50:05.179
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

50:05.305 --> 50:07.557
Go ahead, take a look around.

50:12.395 --> 50:14.272
You don't wanna do that.

50:14.397 --> 50:15.982
You'll be able to access that

50:16.107 --> 50:17.984
as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.

50:18.109 --> 50:20.153
Can we generate
some encrypted pass codes?

50:20.278 --> 50:23.364
Get some of those
encrypted pass codes, Jack.

50:24.574 --> 50:26.200
Never mind, I...

50:27.493 --> 50:30.747
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

50:33.249 --> 50:35.543
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

50:37.837 --> 50:39.047
Well...

50:40.548 --> 50:41.966
You're good.

50:42.258 --> 50:45.386
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

50:46.679 --> 50:49.515
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

50:49.641 --> 50:51.517
Go ahead, take a look.

50:52.477 --> 50:55.063
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

50:55.188 --> 50:57.148
You know,
those are really just for show and tell.

50:57.273 --> 51:02.236
They're $125.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.

51:04.364 --> 51:07.200
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

51:08.117 --> 51:10.662
That's where the pilot goes.

51:10.787 --> 51:14.791
I'm having a tough time
finding volunteers.

51:14.916 --> 51:18.044
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

51:18.169 --> 51:19.629
What you want them do?

51:19.754 --> 51:24.926
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

51:25.051 --> 51:27.053
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

51:27.178 --> 51:28.262
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

51:28.388 --> 51:30.264
I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.

51:30.390 --> 51:31.766
You know what I'm talking about?

51:31.891 --> 51:34.018
- I can do that. No problem.
- Yeah?

51:34.143 --> 51:36.270
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

51:36.396 --> 51:39.107
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

51:48.658 --> 51:51.077
Do you know which watch
you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

51:51.411 --> 51:53.371
I'll give them a look.

51:56.332 --> 51:57.750
I should cancel the party.

51:58.876 --> 52:00.086
- Probably.
- Yeah.

52:00.211 --> 52:02.797
- 'Cause it's...
- Ill-timed.

52:02.922 --> 52:04.382
Right, sends the wrong message.

52:04.507 --> 52:05.967
Inappropriate.

52:11.848 --> 52:14.100
Is that dirty enough for you?

52:15.101 --> 52:18.855
Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

52:19.397 --> 52:20.815
Bring them over here.

52:24.110 --> 52:26.237
I'll take that. Why don't you...

52:38.374 --> 52:40.668
I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.

52:40.960 --> 52:43.129
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

52:45.882 --> 52:47.967
Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?

52:48.092 --> 52:49.344
Bit odd.

52:49.677 --> 52:53.014
If this was your last birthday party
you were ever gonna have,

52:53.139 --> 52:54.682
how would you celebrate it?

52:57.393 --> 53:01.522
I'd do whatever I wanted to do
with whoever I wanted to do it with.

53:32.178 --> 53:34.347
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

53:35.306 --> 53:37.225
Yes, sir, I understand.

53:37.850 --> 53:41.562
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

53:41.688 --> 53:43.982
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,

53:44.107 --> 53:45.900
Iron Man will be back on watch.

53:53.241 --> 53:54.659
Hey, Pepper.

53:55.034 --> 53:57.120
I'm going to go get some air.

53:57.245 --> 53:58.579
What's wrong?

53:59.414 --> 54:01.666
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

54:07.922 --> 54:10.508
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
- No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

54:10.633 --> 54:12.510
This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

54:12.635 --> 54:13.845
I know. I know. I get it.

54:13.970 --> 54:15.179
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.

54:15.305 --> 54:18.182
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

54:19.434 --> 54:21.060
<i>You know, the question</i>
<i>I get asked most often is,</i>

54:21.185 --> 54:23.646
<i>"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom</i>
<i>in the suit?"</i>

54:27.066 --> 54:28.484
<i>Just like that.</i>

54:32.155 --> 54:35.033
<i>Does this guy know</i>
<i>how to throw a party or what?</i>

54:38.786 --> 54:39.787
<i>I love you.</i>

54:39.912 --> 54:42.540
<i>Unbelievable! Thank you so much.</i>

54:42.665 --> 54:46.586
<i>Tony, we all thank you so much</i>
<i>for such a wonderful night.</i>

54:46.711 --> 54:50.673
<i>And we're gonna say good night now,</i>
<i>and thank you all for coming.</i>

54:50.798 --> 54:51.966
<i>No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.</i>

54:52.091 --> 54:53.843
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.

54:53.968 --> 54:56.721
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

54:56.846 --> 54:59.140
- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.

54:59.265 --> 55:00.350
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be

55:00.475 --> 55:01.643
- happy about this.
- Come on, you know you want to.

55:01.768 --> 55:03.102
You just peed the suit.

55:03.227 --> 55:04.646
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

55:04.771 --> 55:06.147
You could drink that water.

55:06.648 --> 55:09.817
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

55:09.942 --> 55:11.653
- lf you say so.
- Okay.

55:11.778 --> 55:13.905
I'll take this, you take that.

55:15.365 --> 55:16.950
<i>Pepper Potts.</i>

55:18.284 --> 55:19.786
<i>She's right. The party's over.</i>

55:19.911 --> 55:22.830
<i>Then again, the party was over for me,</i>
<i>like, an hour and a half ago.</i>

55:22.956 --> 55:26.417
<i>The after-party starts in 15 minutes.</i>

55:30.046 --> 55:34.175
And if anybody, Pepper,
doesn't like it, there's the door.

55:40.682 --> 55:42.016
Yeah!

55:46.437 --> 55:47.647
Hit!

55:54.862 --> 55:56.030
Pull!

56:05.331 --> 56:06.499
Pull!

56:15.508 --> 56:17.677
I think she wants the Gallagher!

56:27.061 --> 56:28.938
I'm only gonna say this once.

56:32.483 --> 56:33.776
Get out.

56:40.325 --> 56:43.369
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

56:45.038 --> 56:46.164
<i>Goldstein.</i>

56:47.457 --> 56:48.625
Yes, Mr Stark?

56:48.750 --> 56:51.961
Give me a phat beat
to beat my buddy's ass to.

56:55.798 --> 56:57.759
I told you to shut it down.

57:08.311 --> 57:11.856
Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.

57:18.613 --> 57:19.864
Really?

57:27.664 --> 57:31.209
Sorry, pal,
but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

57:31.834 --> 57:34.045
Sidekick this!

57:42.595 --> 57:44.055
Had enough?

57:45.014 --> 57:46.432
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

57:46.557 --> 57:48.643
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.

57:48.768 --> 57:50.770
You know what?
Ever since you came here...

57:54.524 --> 57:55.525
Pepper!

57:57.110 --> 57:58.403
Get out of here. Get out of here.

58:04.701 --> 58:07.412
You want it? Take it!

58:48.703 --> 58:49.871
Put your hand down.

58:49.996 --> 58:52.165
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

58:52.290 --> 58:53.708
We don't have to do this, Tony.

58:53.833 --> 58:55.501
You wanna be the War Machine,
take your shot.

58:55.627 --> 58:57.420
- Put it down!
- You gonna take a shot?

58:57.545 --> 58:58.755
- Put it down!
- No!

58:58.880 --> 59:00.298
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it.

01:00:11.452 --> 01:00:13.746
<i>Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant</i>
<i>Colonel James Rhodes,</i>

01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:17.041
<i>inbound from three miles east</i>
<i>at 5,000 feet...</i>

01:01:01.502 --> 01:01:02.795
Colonel.

01:01:03.796 --> 01:01:05.006
Major.

01:01:05.798 --> 01:01:06.883
Wow.

01:01:08.134 --> 01:01:09.385
Yeah.

01:01:11.262 --> 01:01:13.139
Let's take it inside.

01:01:13.264 --> 01:01:14.724
Clear the area.

01:01:37.497 --> 01:01:38.665
Sir!

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:41.209
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the doughnut.

01:01:45.296 --> 01:01:47.423
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

01:01:48.341 --> 01:01:51.970
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

01:01:52.095 --> 01:01:55.264
- How's that working out for you?
- It's... It's... It's...

01:01:56.808 --> 01:01:58.101
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

01:01:58.226 --> 01:01:59.978
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

01:02:01.145 --> 01:02:02.188
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

01:02:02.313 --> 01:02:04.607
I'm not sure if you're real
or if I'm having...

01:02:04.732 --> 01:02:06.776
I am very real.

01:02:06.901 --> 01:02:08.861
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

01:02:09.404 --> 01:02:12.615
- Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
- That's not looking so good.

01:02:13.408 --> 01:02:15.368
I've been worse.

01:02:17.078 --> 01:02:18.079
We've secured the perimeter,

01:02:18.204 --> 01:02:21.040
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

01:02:24.669 --> 01:02:27.463
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

01:02:28.214 --> 01:02:31.384
Tony, I want you to meet
Agent Romanoff.

01:02:31.509 --> 01:02:32.593
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

01:02:32.719 --> 01:02:35.305
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:37.223
I suggest you apologise.

01:02:37.348 --> 01:02:38.850
You've been very busy.

01:02:38.975 --> 01:02:42.186
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

01:02:42.312 --> 01:02:45.273
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

01:02:45.398 --> 01:02:46.733
Now, if I didn't know better...

01:02:46.858 --> 01:02:48.818
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

01:02:48.943 --> 01:02:51.571
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

01:02:51.696 --> 01:02:54.866
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:57.744
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

01:02:57.869 --> 01:02:59.037
Is that possible?

01:02:59.162 --> 01:03:01.748
Well, according to Mr Stark's
database security guidelines,

01:03:01.873 --> 01:03:04.834
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorised usage.

01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:10.256
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you?

01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:12.216
What do you want from me?

01:03:12.342 --> 01:03:15.970
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

01:03:16.095 --> 01:03:19.307
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the centre of my universe.

01:03:19.432 --> 01:03:22.435
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.561
Hit him.

01:03:24.812 --> 01:03:28.107
Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

01:03:28.608 --> 01:03:31.486
Could you please not do anything awful
for five seconds?

01:03:32.111 --> 01:03:35.698
- What did she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

01:03:35.823 --> 01:03:38.201
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

01:03:38.326 --> 01:03:40.161
We're trying to get you back to work.

01:03:40.286 --> 01:03:42.330
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

01:03:42.455 --> 01:03:44.332
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

01:03:44.457 --> 01:03:46.918
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

01:03:47.043 --> 01:03:49.212
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

01:03:49.337 --> 01:03:51.673
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

01:03:51.798 --> 01:03:56.177
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

01:03:56.302 --> 01:03:59.347
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

01:04:00.848 --> 01:04:03.935
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.561
Candygram.

01:04:09.816 --> 01:04:11.234
I brought you something.

01:04:11.859 --> 01:04:13.569
Oh, yeah.

01:04:16.155 --> 01:04:17.949
We got you the bird, pal.

01:04:18.074 --> 01:04:19.367
This is not my bird.

01:04:19.826 --> 01:04:21.869
What do you mean?
That's the bird. This is the bird.

01:04:21.995 --> 01:04:24.747
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

01:04:24.872 --> 01:04:26.124
This is a great bird.

01:04:26.249 --> 01:04:28.835
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.379
Hey, man, this not my bird.

01:04:33.756 --> 01:04:37.635
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.513
I mean, you know, look,
don't get so attached to things.

01:04:40.638 --> 01:04:42.307
Learn to let go.

01:04:45.101 --> 01:04:47.562
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

01:04:48.146 --> 01:04:51.232
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

01:04:59.782 --> 01:05:03.286
lvan... What's this? Jack.

01:05:04.287 --> 01:05:06.289
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

01:05:06.414 --> 01:05:08.958
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:10.877
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

01:05:11.002 --> 01:05:14.172
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

01:05:14.297 --> 01:05:16.924
See, lvan?
He can't put his head in there.

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:21.387
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

01:05:21.512 --> 01:05:24.849
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

01:05:25.224 --> 01:05:27.310
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

01:05:27.435 --> 01:05:29.979
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

01:05:30.104 --> 01:05:31.856
People make problem.

01:05:31.981 --> 01:05:33.816
Trust me. Drone better.

01:05:34.317 --> 01:05:38.446
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

01:05:39.364 --> 01:05:41.157
You said, "No problem."

01:05:41.282 --> 01:05:44.160
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

01:05:44.285 --> 01:05:47.038
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

01:05:47.163 --> 01:05:49.123
Like Iron Man. You understand?

01:05:49.248 --> 01:05:52.335
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

01:05:53.211 --> 01:05:54.504
Hey, man.

01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:58.633
Don't get too attached to things.

01:05:59.384 --> 01:06:01.052
Learn to let go.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.141
These drones
better steal the show, lvan.

01:06:07.809 --> 01:06:11.187
You understand?
Better rock my world, lvan.

01:06:20.822 --> 01:06:22.448
Unbelievable.

01:06:22.949 --> 01:06:25.576
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

01:06:25.702 --> 01:06:29.038
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

01:06:29.455 --> 01:06:32.792
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponise it.

01:06:33.835 --> 01:06:34.836
Sir?

01:06:34.961 --> 01:06:37.547
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

01:06:37.672 --> 01:06:39.257
We'd like this to introduce it.

01:06:39.382 --> 01:06:40.925
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:43.803
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

01:06:43.928 --> 01:06:46.931
- We've got to make this happen.
- Yes, General, but...

01:06:47.056 --> 01:06:49.017
It's also an order.

01:06:49.434 --> 01:06:50.727
Yes, sir.

01:06:51.144 --> 01:06:54.564
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

01:06:54.689 --> 01:06:56.274
Thank you, sir.

01:07:02.488 --> 01:07:06.159
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

01:07:06.284 --> 01:07:07.285
No, it was finished.

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:11.497
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturised it and put it in my...

01:07:11.623 --> 01:07:13.708
No. Howard said the arc reactor

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:15.543
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

01:07:15.668 --> 01:07:20.131
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

01:07:20.673 --> 01:07:21.758
He was on to something big,

01:07:21.883 --> 01:07:25.303
something so big that it was gonna
make the nuclear reactor

01:07:25.428 --> 01:07:27.388
look like a triple-A battery.

01:07:27.513 --> 01:07:29.974
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

01:07:30.099 --> 01:07:33.144
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

01:07:33.269 --> 01:07:35.271
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

01:07:35.396 --> 01:07:37.732
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

01:07:37.857 --> 01:07:39.734
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

01:07:39.859 --> 01:07:41.361
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

01:07:41.486 --> 01:07:44.197
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

01:07:44.322 --> 01:07:46.824
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:51.037
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

01:07:51.454 --> 01:07:52.747
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

01:07:52.872 --> 01:07:55.041
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

01:07:55.166 --> 01:07:59.379
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

01:07:59.545 --> 01:08:01.506
to finish what he started.

01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:03.091
He said that?

01:08:03.299 --> 01:08:05.885
Are you that guy? Are you?

01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:11.265
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

01:08:15.603 --> 01:08:17.021
I don't know
where you get your information,

01:08:17.146 --> 01:08:19.357
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

01:08:19.482 --> 01:08:20.817
What do you remember
about your dad?

01:08:20.942 --> 01:08:22.610
He was cold, he was calculating.

01:08:22.735 --> 01:08:25.446
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,

01:08:25.571 --> 01:08:27.115
so it's a little tough for me to digest

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.659
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

01:08:29.784 --> 01:08:32.704
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:34.038
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

01:08:34.163 --> 01:08:35.623
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

01:08:35.748 --> 01:08:36.791
That's not true.

01:08:36.916 --> 01:08:39.544
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

01:08:40.003 --> 01:08:43.631
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:08:43.756 --> 01:08:44.882
What?

01:08:45.466 --> 01:08:47.510
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:08:47.635 --> 01:08:49.137
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

01:08:49.262 --> 01:08:50.972
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

01:08:51.097 --> 01:08:52.932
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

01:08:53.057 --> 01:08:56.269
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

01:08:56.394 --> 01:08:59.272
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

01:08:59.731 --> 01:09:01.190
And Tony,

01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:05.445
remember, I got my eye on you.

01:09:11.534 --> 01:09:14.746
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:16.205
Good luck.

01:09:20.335 --> 01:09:21.544
Please.

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:25.340
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

01:09:25.465 --> 01:09:27.592
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

01:09:27.717 --> 01:09:30.261
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

01:09:30.386 --> 01:09:31.471
I'm not here for that.

01:09:31.596 --> 01:09:33.014
I've been authorised by Director Fury

01:09:33.139 --> 01:09:35.558
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

01:09:35.683 --> 01:09:38.269
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

01:09:38.394 --> 01:09:41.564
I will tase you and watch <i>Supernanny</i>
while you drool into the carpet.

01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:43.900
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

01:09:44.025 --> 01:09:45.860
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

01:10:12.261 --> 01:10:13.846
Think this is the power source?

01:10:13.972 --> 01:10:18.726
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

01:10:19.894 --> 01:10:21.187
Yes, sir.

01:10:21.646 --> 01:10:22.897
Oh, yes!

01:10:23.356 --> 01:10:25.233
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

01:10:25.358 --> 01:10:27.068
Is it my birthday?

01:10:27.402 --> 01:10:30.780
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?

01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:36.744
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

01:10:36.869 --> 01:10:39.914
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

01:10:40.123 --> 01:10:41.582
What am I going to do for you?

01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:44.711
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

01:10:44.836 --> 01:10:47.797
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

01:10:47.922 --> 01:10:50.216
I'm talking about firepower.

01:10:51.759 --> 01:10:53.803
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

01:10:55.138 --> 01:10:58.391
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

01:10:59.726 --> 01:11:02.020
Too downtown? I agree.

01:11:02.603 --> 01:11:04.814
M24 shotgun, pump action.

01:11:05.481 --> 01:11:06.733
Five-round magazine.

01:11:06.858 --> 01:11:08.151
You know what? You're not a hunter.

01:11:08.276 --> 01:11:10.320
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

01:11:10.445 --> 01:11:12.864
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

01:11:12.989 --> 01:11:15.241
They do make something
better than waffles.

01:11:16.117 --> 01:11:18.202
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

01:11:18.328 --> 01:11:19.579
so I'm gonna put it right here.

01:11:19.704 --> 01:11:22.707
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

01:11:22.832 --> 01:11:25.835
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

01:11:26.127 --> 01:11:27.420
You're tough.

01:11:27.545 --> 01:11:30.006
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

01:11:30.131 --> 01:11:31.591
Don't let anyone tell you different.

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:35.303
This is an M1347.62 Minigun.

01:11:35.428 --> 01:11:38.848
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

01:11:38.973 --> 01:11:41.059
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho,

01:11:41.184 --> 01:11:43.519
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

01:11:46.564 --> 01:11:47.607
Okay.

01:11:49.567 --> 01:11:53.321
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

01:11:55.031 --> 01:11:56.908
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle

01:11:57.033 --> 01:12:01.287
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

01:12:01.913 --> 01:12:05.375
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.627
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

01:12:07.752 --> 01:12:11.130
A book that would make <i>Ulysses</i>
look like it was written in crayon.

01:12:11.756 --> 01:12:13.549
It would read it to you.

01:12:13.675 --> 01:12:15.134
This is my Eiffel Tower.

01:12:15.259 --> 01:12:18.304
This is my Rachmaninoff's <i>Third.</i>
My <i>Pieta.</i>

01:12:18.429 --> 01:12:21.474
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

01:12:21.599 --> 01:12:26.271
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

01:12:27.397 --> 01:12:29.274
I call it the Ex-Wife.

01:12:34.445 --> 01:12:36.322
That's the best I got.

01:12:41.452 --> 01:12:43.079
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

01:12:43.204 --> 01:12:47.333
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
- I think I'll take it.

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:50.086
- Which one?
- All of it.

01:12:52.088 --> 01:12:53.089
All of it.

01:13:30.543 --> 01:13:34.297
<i>Everything is achievable</i>
<i>through technology.</i>

01:13:34.422 --> 01:13:36.799
<i>Better living, robust health</i>

01:13:36.924 --> 01:13:42.722
<i>and for the first time in human history,</i>
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

01:13:43.264 --> 01:13:44.432
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

01:13:57.528 --> 01:13:58.655
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:02.617
<i>and everything you'll need in the future</i>

01:14:02.742 --> 01:14:05.578
<i>So, from all of us at Stark Industries,</i>

01:14:05.703 --> 01:14:07.956
<i>I would like to personally...</i>

01:14:08.623 --> 01:14:10.833
<i>Tony, what are you doing back there?</i>
<i>What is that?</i>

01:14:10.959 --> 01:14:14.504
<i>Put that back.</i>
<i>Put it back where you got it from.</i>

01:14:14.754 --> 01:14:16.881
<i>Where's your mother? Maria?</i>

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.217
<i>Go on. Go, go, go, go.</i>

01:14:21.552 --> 01:14:23.763
<i>All right, I think we got...</i>

01:14:24.138 --> 01:14:25.890
<i>I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...</i>

01:14:29.852 --> 01:14:31.729
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

01:14:33.564 --> 01:14:38.152
<i>So, from all of us at Stark Industries,</i>
<i>I'd like to personally show you</i>

01:14:38.987 --> 01:14:39.988
<i>my ass.</i>

01:14:40.113 --> 01:14:42.156
<i>I'd like to... I can't... This is...</i>

01:14:42.282 --> 01:14:44.617
<i>I can't... We have this, don't we?</i>

01:14:44.742 --> 01:14:47.662
<i>This is a ridiculous way...</i>

<i>through technology.</i>

01:15:07.265 --> 01:15:08.391
<i>Tony?</i>

01:15:08.516 --> 01:15:10.351
<i>You're too young</i>
<i>to understand this right now,</i>

01:15:10.476 --> 01:15:13.438
<i>so I thought</i>
<i>I would put it on film for you.</i>

01:15:15.315 --> 01:15:17.150
<i>I built this for you.</i>

01:15:18.151 --> 01:15:20.737
<i>And someday you'll realise</i>
<i>that it represents a whole lot more</i>

01:15:20.862 --> 01:15:24.782
<i>than just people's inventions.</i>
<i>It represents my life's work.</i>

01:15:26.034 --> 01:15:28.328
<i>This is the key to the future.</i>

01:15:31.289 --> 01:15:36.044
<i>I'm limited by the technology of my time,</i>
<i>but one day you'll figure this out.</i>

01:15:36.961 --> 01:15:38.630
<i>And when you do,</i>

01:15:39.589 --> 01:15:41.674
<i>you will change the world.</i>

01:15:43.134 --> 01:15:47.055
<i>What is and always will be</i>
<i>my greatest creation</i>

01:15:49.474 --> 01:15:50.808
<i>is you.</i>

01:16:11.829 --> 01:16:14.582
- $6. Six.
- I don't have any dough.

01:16:14.707 --> 01:16:16.250
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

01:16:16.376 --> 01:16:17.543
No, it's fine. Take that.

01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:19.629
- It's fine.
- No, <i>senor.</i>

01:16:19.921 --> 01:16:22.840
Take it. Take it.
I don't like people handing me things.

01:16:22.966 --> 01:16:24.842
If you just drop that there,
that'd be great.

01:16:25.218 --> 01:16:27.804
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

01:16:28.012 --> 01:16:29.722
We believe in you.

01:16:30.181 --> 01:16:32.892
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

01:16:33.309 --> 01:16:34.394
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

01:16:34.519 --> 01:16:35.520
- Mr Stark...
- Is here.

01:16:35.645 --> 01:16:37.480
- He refuses...
- I don't. It's fine.

01:16:37.605 --> 01:16:40.108
- I'll just be a second.
- Listen, it's our position

01:16:40.233 --> 01:16:42.485
that Stark has and continues to maintain

01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:45.280
proprietary ownership
of the Mark II platform.

01:16:45.405 --> 01:16:48.116
<i>When Mr Stark announced</i>
<i>he was indeed Iron Man,</i>

01:16:48.241 --> 01:16:50.410
- <i>he was making a promise to America.</i>
- No, the suit belongs to us.

01:16:50.535 --> 01:16:52.412
<i>We trusted that he would look out for us.</i>

01:16:52.537 --> 01:16:54.580
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
- <i>He obviously did not.</i>

01:16:54.706 --> 01:16:57.000
- <i>And now we learn that his secretary...</i>
- Yes, it does.

01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:59.419
<i>... a woman named</i>
<i>Virginia "Pepper" Potts,</i>

01:16:59.544 --> 01:17:02.213
<i>has been appointed</i>
<i>as CEO of Stark Industries.</i>

01:17:02.338 --> 01:17:03.840
<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

01:17:03.965 --> 01:17:05.008
- No.
- <i>Ms Potts is doing</i>

01:17:05.133 --> 01:17:06.217
<i>nothing to manage this terrible...</i>

01:17:06.342 --> 01:17:07.802
- Mute.
- No...

01:17:08.678 --> 01:17:10.638
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.

01:17:10.763 --> 01:17:13.182
Don't tell me that we have
the best patent lawyers in the country

01:17:13.308 --> 01:17:15.351
and then not let me pursue this.

01:17:15.768 --> 01:17:16.811
I'll get this stuff out of here.

01:17:16.936 --> 01:17:19.731
Well, then, tell the President
to sign an order.

01:17:20.565 --> 01:17:21.983
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

01:17:22.108 --> 01:17:25.069
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

01:17:25.194 --> 01:17:28.031
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

01:17:28.698 --> 01:17:30.950
- No, he will not. Bye.
- I would like to be.

01:17:32.243 --> 01:17:33.286
- Got a minute?
- No.

01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:36.122
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

01:17:37.582 --> 01:17:39.876
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

01:17:40.001 --> 01:17:41.586
I was just driving over here,

01:17:41.711 --> 01:17:44.172
and I thought I was coming
to basically apologise, but I'm not.

01:17:44.297 --> 01:17:47.050
- You didn't come here to apologise?
- Look, that goes without saying,

01:17:47.175 --> 01:17:48.718
and I'm working on that.

01:17:48.843 --> 01:17:52.764
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

01:17:52.889 --> 01:17:54.057
and I just want to try to make good.

01:17:54.182 --> 01:17:56.434
Can I move this? This is crazy.

01:17:56.559 --> 01:17:57.644
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

01:17:57.769 --> 01:17:58.853
- I'm trying to get some...
- No.

01:18:01.648 --> 01:18:03.983
Do you know how short life is?

01:18:04.108 --> 01:18:07.111
And if I never got to express...

01:18:07.236 --> 01:18:09.864
And by the way,
this is somewhat revelatory to me.

01:18:09.989 --> 01:18:12.408
And I don't care...
I mean, I care. It would be nice.

01:18:12.533 --> 01:18:14.118
I'm not expecting you to...

01:18:14.243 --> 01:18:15.370
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

01:18:15.495 --> 01:18:17.330
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Let me stop you right here, okay?

01:18:17.455 --> 01:18:19.874
Because if you say "l" one more time,

01:18:19.999 --> 01:18:22.752
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

01:18:23.378 --> 01:18:25.254
I am trying to run a company.

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:27.882
- Do you have any idea what that entails?
- Yes.

01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:30.969
People are relying on you to be Iron Man
and you've disappeared,

01:18:31.094 --> 01:18:34.389
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires
and taking the heat for it.

01:18:37.058 --> 01:18:40.478
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

01:18:44.274 --> 01:18:46.567
Did you bring me strawberries?

01:18:47.735 --> 01:18:51.114
Did you know that there's only
one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

01:18:51.239 --> 01:18:53.449
Allergic to strawberries.

01:18:56.035 --> 01:18:57.036
This is progress, Pepper.

01:18:57.161 --> 01:18:59.831
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:02.000
- I need you...
- I need you, too.

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:04.752
...to leave now.
- That's what I'm trying to...

01:19:09.966 --> 01:19:11.342
Ms Potts?

01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:15.305
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheels up in 25 minutes.

01:19:15.888 --> 01:19:17.223
Thank you.

01:19:19.017 --> 01:19:20.476
- Anything else, boss?
- I'm good, Hap.

01:19:20.602 --> 01:19:23.646
No, I'll be just... another minute.

01:19:24.689 --> 01:19:26.274
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

01:19:30.570 --> 01:19:31.613
No.

01:19:33.823 --> 01:19:38.911
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?

01:19:40.079 --> 01:19:42.290
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

01:19:42.415 --> 01:19:45.335
I thought you two didn't get along.

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:48.713
- No. That's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

01:19:48.963 --> 01:19:51.341
- No? Nothing?
- Actually, while you're here,

01:19:51.466 --> 01:19:54.510
maybe you and Natalie could discuss
the matter of the personal belongings.

01:19:54.636 --> 01:19:56.012
Absolutely.

01:20:02.518 --> 01:20:03.519
I'm surprised
you can keep your mouth shut.

01:20:03.645 --> 01:20:04.687
Boy, you're good.

01:20:04.812 --> 01:20:07.315
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.233
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

01:20:09.359 --> 01:20:11.611
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

01:20:11.736 --> 01:20:12.779
Do you even speak Latin?

01:20:14.989 --> 01:20:17.575
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.912
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

01:20:22.538 --> 01:20:23.957
You're good.

01:21:23.766 --> 01:21:26.394
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form
a digital wire frame?

01:21:26.519 --> 01:21:29.022
I need a manipulatable projection.

01:21:36.321 --> 01:21:39.824
<i>1974 Stark Expo</i>
<i>model scan complete, sir.</i>

01:21:42.118 --> 01:21:43.911
How many buildings are there?

01:21:44.037 --> 01:21:46.456
<i>Am I to include</i>
<i>the Belgian waffle stands?</i>

01:21:46.581 --> 01:21:49.083
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

01:22:01.888 --> 01:22:06.476
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.

01:22:06.601 --> 01:22:10.021
In which case the nucleus
would be here.

01:22:11.147 --> 01:22:13.191
Highlight the unisphere.

01:22:22.033 --> 01:22:27.038
- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- <i>What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?</i>

01:22:27.163 --> 01:22:28.957
I'm discovering... Correction.

01:22:29.082 --> 01:22:33.002
I'm rediscovering a new element,
I believe.

01:22:33.836 --> 01:22:36.839
Lose the landscaping,
the shrubbery, the trees.

01:22:36.965 --> 01:22:39.217
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

01:22:44.055 --> 01:22:50.019
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

01:22:53.147 --> 01:22:54.232
Dad.

01:23:15.545 --> 01:23:20.258
Dead for almost 20 years,
and still taking me to school.

01:23:26.514 --> 01:23:31.102
<i>The proposed element should serve</i>
<i>as a viable replacement for palladium.</i>

01:23:31.227 --> 01:23:32.270
Thanks, Dad.

01:23:32.395 --> 01:23:35.565
<i>Unfortunately, it is impossible</i>
<i>to synthesise.</i>

01:23:40.153 --> 01:23:43.698
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

01:24:31.537 --> 01:24:33.790
- I heard you broke the perimeter.
- Yeah.

01:24:33.957 --> 01:24:35.792
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?

01:24:35.959 --> 01:24:39.921
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

01:24:40.046 --> 01:24:42.006
Hey, I'm playing for
the home team, Coulson,

01:24:42.131 --> 01:24:44.175
you and all your
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:46.052
Now, are you gonna let me work
or break my balls?

01:24:48.388 --> 01:24:50.348
What's this doing here?

01:24:52.225 --> 01:24:53.268
That's it.

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.688
- Bring that to me.
- You know what this is?

01:24:56.813 --> 01:24:58.273
It's exactly what I need
to make this work.

01:25:00.275 --> 01:25:01.276
Lift the coil.

01:25:01.818 --> 01:25:03.194
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

01:25:03.861 --> 01:25:05.697
There you go. And...

01:25:06.781 --> 01:25:08.658
Drop it. Drop it.

01:25:11.869 --> 01:25:14.956
Perfectly level.
I'm busy. What do you want?

01:25:15.081 --> 01:25:18.209
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.

01:25:18.835 --> 01:25:20.378
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

01:25:20.503 --> 01:25:22.922
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
- So I'm told.

01:25:23.047 --> 01:25:25.049
- Secret stuff?
- Something like that.

01:25:26.509 --> 01:25:27.510
- Good luck.
- Bye.

01:25:27.635 --> 01:25:29.679
- Thanks.
- We need you.

01:25:29.804 --> 01:25:32.724
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

01:25:51.117 --> 01:25:53.703
<i>Initialising prismatic accelerator.</i>

01:25:59.834 --> 01:26:02.211
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

01:26:49.759 --> 01:26:50.927
That was easy.

01:27:07.527 --> 01:27:09.445
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

01:27:11.239 --> 01:27:13.700
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

01:27:21.666 --> 01:27:25.461
<i>Sir, the reactor has accepted</i>
<i>the modified core.</i>

01:27:25.586 --> 01:27:28.131
<i>I will begin running diagnostics.</i>

01:27:34.053 --> 01:27:35.388
Hey, lvan.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.307
<i>I got Senator Stern here.</i>

01:27:37.432 --> 01:27:39.726
<i>Thought we'd swing over</i>
<i>and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

01:27:39.851 --> 01:27:42.103
The drone is not going to be ready.

01:27:42.395 --> 01:27:43.605
Not ready? What do you mean?

01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:47.150
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

01:27:47.275 --> 01:27:49.235
What the hell is the difference?

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.113
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

01:27:52.405 --> 01:27:54.240
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:27:54.365 --> 01:27:57.452
What can you make them do? I mean,
this is a weapons demonstration.

01:27:57.577 --> 01:28:00.872
- I can make salute.
- <i>You can make salute?</i>

01:28:00.997 --> 01:28:02.332
What do you mean, "make salute"?

01:28:02.457 --> 01:28:06.502
<i>What the hell does that mean, lvan?</i>
<i>This is not what we agreed to, okay?</i>

01:28:06.628 --> 01:28:09.213
<i>You promised me suits</i>
<i>and then you promised me drones.</i>

01:28:09.339 --> 01:28:13.384
- Hey, man, everything will be okay.
- <i>This is not what I wanted.</i>

01:28:25.563 --> 01:28:28.149
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

01:28:29.734 --> 01:28:35.323
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

01:28:36.324 --> 01:28:39.661
You said it wasn't,
but now it looks like you're best of pals.

01:28:39.786 --> 01:28:43.665
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what? Take the bird.

01:28:45.458 --> 01:28:46.584
Hey!

01:28:48.711 --> 01:28:51.339
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

01:28:52.632 --> 01:28:54.550
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

01:28:58.638 --> 01:29:00.306
I took your stuff.

01:29:00.431 --> 01:29:03.559
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?

01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:06.980
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.775
We had a contract.

01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:13.194
I saved your life

01:29:13.987 --> 01:29:15.947
and you give me suits.

01:29:16.531 --> 01:29:18.241
That was our deal.

01:29:18.366 --> 01:29:20.368
And you did not deliver.

01:29:21.244 --> 01:29:25.707
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

01:29:28.084 --> 01:29:31.379
Something really, really great
fell into my lap.

01:29:32.005 --> 01:29:35.216
And if it hadn't,
I'd be at your mercy tonight.

01:29:35.508 --> 01:29:39.262
Now I have a piece of Stark tech
that I pimped out myself.

01:29:39.554 --> 01:29:41.264
And now your overpriced paperweights

01:29:41.389 --> 01:29:43.933
are gonna look like a backdrop
to my demonstration.

01:29:44.475 --> 01:29:46.644
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

01:29:48.938 --> 01:29:53.151
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

01:29:56.613 --> 01:29:58.448
I'm gonna leave now.

01:29:58.573 --> 01:30:01.618
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

01:30:02.410 --> 01:30:04.203
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

01:30:04.412 --> 01:30:06.873
They are not to be trifled with.

01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:09.125
When I get back,
we're gonna renegotiate

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:11.544
the terms of our agreement.

01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:14.172
And you're gonna make good
on our arrangement

01:30:14.756 --> 01:30:15.840
because if you don't,

01:30:15.965 --> 01:30:18.343
you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you,

01:30:18.468 --> 01:30:20.094
a dead man.

01:30:20.219 --> 01:30:21.596
You got that?

01:30:22.597 --> 01:30:24.891
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

01:30:34.359 --> 01:30:36.694
Dummy, you, can we clean up
this mess? You're killing me.

01:30:36.819 --> 01:30:38.196
- You know I don't...
- <i>Incoming call</i>

01:30:38.321 --> 01:30:40.031
<i>with a blocked number, sir.</i>

01:30:40.156 --> 01:30:43.326
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.

01:30:43.451 --> 01:30:44.869
Coulson.
How's the Land of Enchantment?

01:30:44.994 --> 01:30:47.664
<i>Hey, Tony, how you doing?</i>

01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:51.292
- <i>I double cycle.</i>
- You what?

01:30:52.335 --> 01:30:56.172
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

01:30:56.547 --> 01:30:58.174
You sound pretty sprightly
for a dead guy.

01:30:58.299 --> 01:30:59.759
<i>You, too.</i>

01:31:02.387 --> 01:31:03.680
- Trace him.
- <i>Sir.</i>

01:31:03.805 --> 01:31:07.517
Now, the true history of Stark name
will be written.

01:31:07.642 --> 01:31:08.685
Jarvis, where is he?

01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:12.897
<i>Accessing the Oracle grid.</i>
<i>Eastern Seaboard.</i>

01:31:13.022 --> 01:31:17.110
What your father did
to my family over 40 years,

01:31:17.986 --> 01:31:20.571
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

01:31:20.822 --> 01:31:22.699
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.

01:31:23.032 --> 01:31:24.325
<i>Tri-State area.</i>

01:31:24.450 --> 01:31:26.661
<i>Manhattan and outlying boroughs.</i>

01:31:26.786 --> 01:31:28.663
I hope you're ready.

01:31:31.457 --> 01:31:33.418
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

01:31:44.053 --> 01:31:46.598
- <i>Sir...</i>
- You want to run some tests, run them.

01:31:47.682 --> 01:31:49.601
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

01:31:49.726 --> 01:31:52.103
- <i>We are unclear as to the effects...</i>
- I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

01:31:56.566 --> 01:31:58.610
That tastes like coconut.

01:31:58.735 --> 01:32:00.403
And metal.

01:32:00.778 --> 01:32:02.280
Oh, wow, yeah!

01:32:14.959 --> 01:32:16.753
I'll keep the car down here, all right?

01:32:16.878 --> 01:32:18.129
Thank you, Happy.

01:32:18.254 --> 01:32:22.967
<i>... Justin Hammer. His presentation</i>
<i>will begin shortly in the main pavilion.</i>

01:32:41.486 --> 01:32:42.695
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:32:43.863 --> 01:32:47.158
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

01:32:47.825 --> 01:32:49.744
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,</i>

01:32:49.869 --> 01:32:54.374
<i>this country has had to place its</i>
<i>brave men and women in harm's way,</i>

01:32:54.582 --> 01:32:56.167
<i>but then the Iron Man arrived,</i>

01:32:56.292 --> 01:32:59.921
<i>and we thought the days</i>
<i>of losing lives were behind us.</i>

01:33:00.797 --> 01:33:03.508
<i>Sadly, that technology</i>
<i>was kept out of reach.</i>

01:33:03.633 --> 01:33:05.927
<i>That's not fair. That's not right.</i>

01:33:06.052 --> 01:33:08.263
- <i>And it's just too bad.</i>
- Oh, Lord.

01:33:08.388 --> 01:33:10.431
<i>Regardless, it was</i>
<i>an impressive innovation,</i>

01:33:10.556 --> 01:33:13.434
<i>one that grabbed headlines</i>
<i>the world over.</i>

01:33:13.851 --> 01:33:15.436
<i>Well, today, my friends,</i>

01:33:15.561 --> 01:33:18.982
<i>the press is faced</i>
<i>with quite a different problem.</i>

01:33:19.524 --> 01:33:21.985
<i>They are about to run out of ink.</i>

01:33:27.573 --> 01:33:29.492
Get that out of here.

01:33:30.493 --> 01:33:32.328
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:33:33.413 --> 01:33:35.915
<i>today I present to you</i>

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:39.210
<i>the new face</i>
<i>of the United States military.</i>

01:33:40.628 --> 01:33:41.879
<i>The Hammer drone.</i>

01:33:44.465 --> 01:33:45.842
<i>Army!</i>

01:33:59.022 --> 01:34:00.148
<i>Navy!</i>

01:34:10.408 --> 01:34:11.826
<i>Air Force!</i>

01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:21.002
<i>Marines!</i>

01:34:32.931 --> 01:34:34.057
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:34:34.349 --> 01:34:35.516
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.898
<i>That's a hell of a lot better</i>
<i>than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.</i>

01:34:43.274 --> 01:34:46.110
<i>But as revolutionary</i>
<i>as this technology is,</i>

01:34:46.235 --> 01:34:49.906
<i>there will always be a need for man</i>
<i>to be present in the theatre of war.</i>

01:34:50.531 --> 01:34:53.534
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>today I am proud to present to you</i>

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:55.370
<i>the very first prototype</i>

01:34:55.495 --> 01:34:58.748
<i>in the Variable Threat Response</i>
<i>Battle Suit</i>

01:34:58.873 --> 01:35:02.669
<i>and its pilot, Air Force</i>
<i>Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.</i>

01:35:04.253 --> 01:35:05.463
What?

01:35:26.401 --> 01:35:29.612
<i>For America and its allies,</i>
<i>Hammer Industries is reporting for...</i>

01:35:46.671 --> 01:35:48.298
We got trouble.

01:35:48.423 --> 01:35:50.091
Tony, there are civilians present.

01:35:50.216 --> 01:35:52.802
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

01:35:52.927 --> 01:35:54.178
Give them a wave.

01:35:54.304 --> 01:35:56.431
<i>Hey, all right. Yeah.</i>

01:35:56.556 --> 01:35:58.558
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

01:35:58.683 --> 01:36:00.643
You gotta trust me
for the next five minutes.

01:36:00.768 --> 01:36:02.812
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

01:36:02.937 --> 01:36:04.939
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

01:36:05.064 --> 01:36:06.649
Vanko's alive?

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:09.027
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:36:09.152 --> 01:36:10.361
Where is he?

01:36:10.778 --> 01:36:12.739
- What?
- Where's Vanko?

01:36:13.239 --> 01:36:14.490
- Who?
- Tell me.

01:36:15.158 --> 01:36:17.118
What are you doing here, man?

01:36:17.243 --> 01:36:18.870
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:36:23.291 --> 01:36:25.668
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

01:36:26.794 --> 01:36:29.422
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!

01:36:30.256 --> 01:36:32.383
Get out of here. Go! This whole
system's been compromised.

01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:35.678
Let's take it outside.

01:36:47.857 --> 01:36:49.067
No. No!

01:36:59.077 --> 01:37:02.288
- Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:37:04.165 --> 01:37:07.043
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

01:37:07.168 --> 01:37:08.753
- On what?
- On you.

01:37:13.841 --> 01:37:15.635
Tony, on your six!

01:37:32.986 --> 01:37:35.321
- What's going on? What's happening?
- The software's been overridden.

01:37:35.446 --> 01:37:36.614
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

01:37:36.739 --> 01:37:38.032
- What does that mean?
- I think he slaved the drones.

01:37:38.157 --> 01:37:39.242
That's impossible.

01:37:39.367 --> 01:37:40.994
- Call the guards.
- All the phones are down, sir.

01:37:41.119 --> 01:37:43.204
Well, then call their... Call their cells.

01:37:43.329 --> 01:37:44.831
Their cell phones
are not working, either, sir.

01:37:44.956 --> 01:37:46.124
He's locked us out of the mainframe.

01:37:46.249 --> 01:37:47.417
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

01:37:47.542 --> 01:37:49.043
Please, please, go away. Go away.

01:37:49.168 --> 01:37:50.461
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

01:37:50.586 --> 01:37:51.671
Yes, I do.

01:37:51.796 --> 01:37:54.215
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't be happening.

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:56.676
So please, now go away. Thank you.

01:37:57.093 --> 01:37:59.387
Listen, we got to get
these bitches out of here.

01:37:59.637 --> 01:38:01.055
What?

01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.473
You tell me who's behind this.

01:38:02.599 --> 01:38:07.103
- Who's behind this?
- Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

01:38:07.562 --> 01:38:10.106
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

01:38:13.484 --> 01:38:15.111
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no!

01:38:15.236 --> 01:38:16.362
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

01:38:16.487 --> 01:38:18.364
- Don't call the authorities.
- Okay. Right away. Right away.

01:38:18.489 --> 01:38:20.491
Step aside. Step aside.

01:38:21.492 --> 01:38:23.119
Tell me everything you know. Go.

01:38:30.585 --> 01:38:33.546
- How are we doing, Jarvis?
- <i>Remote reboot unsuccessful.</i>

01:38:51.064 --> 01:38:52.523
This way.

01:38:53.232 --> 01:38:55.026
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

01:38:55.151 --> 01:38:57.362
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.

01:38:57.487 --> 01:38:59.864
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- Fine. You want me to drive?

01:38:59.989 --> 01:39:02.492
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

01:40:01.009 --> 01:40:02.635
Nice work, kid.

01:40:04.429 --> 01:40:07.724
- <i>You got multiples coming in on you.</i>
- Let's get this away from the Expo.

01:40:13.187 --> 01:40:15.565
When we arrive,
I need you to watch the perimeter.

01:40:15.690 --> 01:40:19.319
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

01:40:21.613 --> 01:40:24.198
- Watch the road.
- I got it. I got it.

01:40:54.646 --> 01:40:55.688
Listen, listen.

01:40:55.813 --> 01:40:57.815
A pack just peeled off.
They're headed back to the Expo.

01:40:57.941 --> 01:40:59.233
Got it.

01:41:03.029 --> 01:41:04.489
I'm closing on you.

01:41:04.614 --> 01:41:06.950
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.510
- Stay in the car.
- I'm not staying in the car.

01:41:25.635 --> 01:41:27.136
I said, stay in the car.

01:41:27.345 --> 01:41:29.305
What are you wearing?

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:32.892
Look, I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

01:41:33.017 --> 01:41:34.394
You want to help? Keep the car running.

01:41:34.519 --> 01:41:35.770
Okay.

01:41:39.315 --> 01:41:41.567
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.

01:41:42.026 --> 01:41:43.528
Hold on. Hey!

01:42:28.281 --> 01:42:30.199
Each set of drones is communicating

01:42:30.325 --> 01:42:33.036
- in its own unique language.
- Well, choose one and focus on that.

01:42:33.161 --> 01:42:35.121
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?

01:42:38.625 --> 01:42:41.127
<i>Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.</i>

01:42:41.252 --> 01:42:43.504
We got it. We're on our way.

01:43:24.963 --> 01:43:26.381
I got him!

01:43:41.271 --> 01:43:43.273
- Rhodey, you still locked on?
- Yeah.

01:43:43.398 --> 01:43:46.818
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

01:43:49.028 --> 01:43:50.113
Wait, wait, wait!

01:44:09.757 --> 01:44:11.134
He's gone.

01:44:15.263 --> 01:44:17.265
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

01:44:18.099 --> 01:44:19.892
What's your 20?

01:44:31.529 --> 01:44:34.324
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

01:44:40.788 --> 01:44:41.789
Tony!

01:44:58.348 --> 01:44:59.974
Reboot complete.

01:45:00.683 --> 01:45:02.393
You got your best friend back.

01:45:02.518 --> 01:45:05.855
- <i>Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.</i>
- Well done with the new chest piece.

01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:09.609
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

01:45:09.734 --> 01:45:12.445
<i>Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:45:12.570 --> 01:45:14.614
<i>What do you mean you're not dying?</i>
<i>Did you just say you're dying?</i>

01:45:14.739 --> 01:45:16.449
<i>Is that you? No, I'm not.</i>

01:45:16.574 --> 01:45:18.076
- <i>Not any more.</i>
- <i>What's going on?</i>

01:45:18.201 --> 01:45:19.911
<i>I was going to tell you.</i>
<i>I didn't want to alarm you.</i>

01:45:20.036 --> 01:45:21.496
<i>You were gonna tell me?</i>
<i>You really were dying?</i>

01:45:21.621 --> 01:45:23.331
- <i>You didn't let me.</i>
- <i>Why didn't you tell me that?</i>

01:45:23.456 --> 01:45:26.167
<i>I was gonna make you an omelette</i>
<i>and tell you.</i>

01:45:26.292 --> 01:45:29.212
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

01:45:29.337 --> 01:45:30.880
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

01:45:31.005 --> 01:45:32.799
- <i>Great. Pepper?</i>
- <i>Are you okay now?</i>

01:45:32.924 --> 01:45:34.092
<i>I am fine. Don't be mad.</i>

01:45:34.217 --> 01:45:35.760
- <i>I will formally apologise...</i>
- <i>I am mad!</i>

01:45:35.885 --> 01:45:38.805
<i>... when I'm not fending off</i>
<i>a Hammeroid attack.</i>

01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:40.390
- <i>Fine.</i>
- <i>We could have been in Venice.</i>

01:45:40.515 --> 01:45:41.557
<i>Oh, please.</i>

01:45:44.811 --> 01:45:46.187
<i>Rhodes?</i>

01:45:46.646 --> 01:45:49.274
<i>Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.</i>

01:45:50.108 --> 01:45:52.360
<i>They're coming.</i>
<i>Come on, let's roll. Get up.</i>

01:45:55.697 --> 01:45:57.782
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

01:46:01.327 --> 01:46:02.620
You okay?

01:46:02.829 --> 01:46:04.372
Yeah, thanks.

01:46:05.957 --> 01:46:08.334
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
- Don't be.

01:46:08.459 --> 01:46:09.627
No. I should have trusted you more.

01:46:09.752 --> 01:46:11.296
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

01:46:11.421 --> 01:46:13.715
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:17.093
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
Partner.

01:46:17.385 --> 01:46:20.930
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

01:46:21.598 --> 01:46:23.182
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

01:46:23.308 --> 01:46:24.851
So let's put the biggest gun
up on that ridge.

01:46:24.976 --> 01:46:26.227
Got you.

01:46:27.103 --> 01:46:28.146
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

01:46:28.271 --> 01:46:29.856
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

01:46:29.981 --> 01:46:31.941
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.

01:46:32.066 --> 01:46:33.401
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,

01:46:33.526 --> 01:46:34.652
- all the bells and whistles.
- Yeah.

01:46:34.777 --> 01:46:37.238
- It's called being a badass.
- Fine.

01:46:37.989 --> 01:46:41.326
All right.
You go up top. I'll draw them in.

01:46:41.451 --> 01:46:43.286
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

01:46:43.411 --> 01:46:44.621
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?

01:46:44.746 --> 01:46:47.624
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

01:47:37.382 --> 01:47:39.133
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

01:47:47.183 --> 01:47:48.393
Rhodey?

01:47:49.811 --> 01:47:51.229
Get down.

01:48:01.531 --> 01:48:03.950
Wow. I think
you should lead with that next time.

01:48:04.075 --> 01:48:07.370
Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

01:48:09.831 --> 01:48:11.958
I told you that five minutes ago.

01:48:13.293 --> 01:48:14.669
That's your guy here.

01:48:16.045 --> 01:48:18.006
- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.

01:48:18.131 --> 01:48:19.549
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

01:48:19.674 --> 01:48:21.259
I'm trying to help here.

01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:28.933
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

01:48:29.058 --> 01:48:30.602
That's good. That's good.

01:48:30.727 --> 01:48:33.605
You're starting to think like a CEO,
taking out the competition.

01:48:33.813 --> 01:48:36.190
I like that. You think you're making
a problem for me?

01:48:36.316 --> 01:48:37.358
I'm gonna make a problem for you.

01:48:37.483 --> 01:48:40.445
I'm gonna be seeing you again
real soon.

01:48:44.699 --> 01:48:46.159
When they get here,
I think you should station them

01:48:46.284 --> 01:48:49.078
at the south, east and both west exits.

01:48:49.203 --> 01:48:51.247
We shut down the 7 train
in and out of Willets Point already.

01:48:51.372 --> 01:48:54.125
Well, have city buses there
to ferry people to operating lines.

01:48:54.250 --> 01:48:55.710
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

01:48:55.877 --> 01:48:59.297
- No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.
- Okay.

01:49:01.090 --> 01:49:03.551
Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.

01:49:03.718 --> 01:49:05.011
This one looks different.

01:49:05.511 --> 01:49:07.847
<i>The repulsor signature</i>
<i>is significantly higher.</i>

01:49:18.983 --> 01:49:20.610
Good to be back.

01:49:21.235 --> 01:49:22.695
This ain't gonna be good.

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.284
I got something special for this guy.

01:49:28.409 --> 01:49:30.495
I'm gonna bust his bunker
with the Ex-Wife.

01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:32.038
With the what?

01:49:42.465 --> 01:49:44.926
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

01:49:46.803 --> 01:49:48.346
I got this.

01:50:41.316 --> 01:50:43.276
Rhodes. I got an idea.

01:50:43.693 --> 01:50:46.154
- You want to be a hero?
- What?

01:50:46.529 --> 01:50:49.449
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

01:50:49.574 --> 01:50:51.409
- This is your idea?
- Yep.

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.704
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!

01:50:58.541 --> 01:50:59.584
Take it.

01:51:28.196 --> 01:51:29.572
You lose.

01:51:37.163 --> 01:51:39.874
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.

01:51:40.416 --> 01:51:41.626
Pepper?

01:52:21.833 --> 01:52:23.543
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.

01:52:23.668 --> 01:52:25.044
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

01:52:25.169 --> 01:52:26.546
- Look at me.
- My body, literally,

01:52:26.671 --> 01:52:27.880
cannot handle the stress.

01:52:28.006 --> 01:52:32.468
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself
or wreck the whole company.

01:52:32.594 --> 01:52:34.554
I think I did okay.

01:52:34.762 --> 01:52:36.764
I quit. I'm resigning.

01:52:37.432 --> 01:52:38.766
That's it.

01:52:39.392 --> 01:52:41.936
What did you just say? You're done?

01:52:43.271 --> 01:52:46.733
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.

01:52:47.191 --> 01:52:50.445
- You don't have to make any excuses.
- I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:51.654
You actually were just making excuses.

01:52:51.779 --> 01:52:53.239
- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

01:52:53.364 --> 01:52:54.657
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

01:52:54.782 --> 01:52:57.076
- You deserve better.
- Well...

01:52:57.201 --> 01:52:59.746
You've taken such good care of me.

01:53:00.663 --> 01:53:03.041
I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so...

01:53:03.166 --> 01:53:04.375
Right?

01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:05.710
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:53:06.544 --> 01:53:09.464
- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:12.216
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
- Okay. What about the press?

01:53:12.342 --> 01:53:14.177
Because you only had
the job for a week. That's gonna seem...

01:53:14.302 --> 01:53:15.970
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

01:53:16.095 --> 01:53:17.430
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

01:53:30.526 --> 01:53:31.736
Weird.

01:53:32.028 --> 01:53:33.488
- No, it's not weird.
- It's okay, right?

01:53:33.613 --> 01:53:35.490
- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.

01:53:35.615 --> 01:53:37.450
I think it was weird.

01:53:37.909 --> 01:53:40.828
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

01:53:41.412 --> 01:53:43.831
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

01:53:43.957 --> 01:53:46.417
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

01:53:46.542 --> 01:53:49.420
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:52.882
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

01:53:53.007 --> 01:53:55.593
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

01:53:55.718 --> 01:53:58.179
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

01:53:58.304 --> 01:54:01.432
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

01:54:01.557 --> 01:54:03.268
Not okay. Not okay with that.

01:54:03.893 --> 01:54:05.103
It wasn't a question.

01:54:10.733 --> 01:54:14.028
How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?

01:54:33.923 --> 01:54:36.801
I don't think I want you looking at that.

01:54:37.010 --> 01:54:39.137
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.

01:54:39.262 --> 01:54:44.475
Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

01:54:45.768 --> 01:54:46.811
Read it.

01:54:48.771 --> 01:54:52.734
"Personality overview. Mr Stark displays
compulsive behaviour."

01:54:52.859 --> 01:54:54.986
In my own defence, that was last week.

01:54:57.071 --> 01:54:59.866
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

01:55:00.033 --> 01:55:02.577
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

01:55:02.994 --> 01:55:05.788
"Textbook narcissism"?

01:55:07.874 --> 01:55:08.916
Agreed.

01:55:10.043 --> 01:55:11.377
Okay, here it is.

01:55:11.502 --> 01:55:14.797
"Recruitment assessment
for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

01:55:14.923 --> 01:55:17.425
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

01:55:20.011 --> 01:55:21.512
"Tony Stark not...

01:55:21.638 --> 01:55:23.139
"Not recommended"?

01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:25.558
That doesn't make any sense.

01:55:25.683 --> 01:55:28.561
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:30.647
I got a new ticker.

01:55:30.772 --> 01:55:33.733
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

01:55:34.359 --> 01:55:37.236
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

01:55:38.112 --> 01:55:39.948
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

01:55:40.073 --> 01:55:43.201
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

01:55:50.166 --> 01:55:52.001
You can't afford me.

01:55:54.379 --> 01:55:56.589
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer

01:55:56.714 --> 01:55:59.550
in exchange for a small favour.

01:56:00.551 --> 01:56:05.431
Rhodey and I are being honoured
in Washington and we need a presenter.

01:56:07.308 --> 01:56:08.768
I'll see what I can do.

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:15.316
<i>It is my honour to be here today</i>
<i>to present these distinguished awards</i>

01:56:15.441 --> 01:56:19.404
<i>to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes</i>
<i>and Mr Tony Stark,</i>

01:56:19.529 --> 01:56:22.824
<i>who is, of course, a national treasure.</i>

01:56:25.034 --> 01:56:26.327
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

01:56:26.452 --> 01:56:28.788
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

01:56:29.122 --> 01:56:31.082
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

01:56:32.834 --> 01:56:34.085
Mr Stark.

01:56:34.210 --> 01:56:38.256
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

01:56:38.381 --> 01:56:40.008
You deserve this.

01:56:41.509 --> 01:56:43.928
Oh, sorry.

01:56:44.053 --> 01:56:47.432
Funny how annoying
a little prick can be, isn't it?

01:56:48.933 --> 01:56:50.685
Let's get a photo.

02:04:16.881 --> 02:04:18.800
Sir, we've found it.
