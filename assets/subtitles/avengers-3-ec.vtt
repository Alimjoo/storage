00:26.340 --> 00:30.580
这里是阿斯加德难民船  要员号
This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.760
我们遭遇了袭击
We are under assault.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.870
我重复  我们遭遇了袭击
I repeat, we are under assault.

00:37.020 --> 00:40.090
引擎熄火  生命保障系统濒临崩溃
The engines are dead, life support failing.

00:40.850 --> 00:43.900
请求附近飞船支援
Requesting aid from any vessel within range.

00:43.900 --> 00:46.970
我们距阿斯加德22个跳跃点
We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.

00:47.940 --> 00:50.400
船上人员均是阿斯加德家庭
Our crew is made up of Asgardian families.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.240
这里的士兵很少
We have very few soldiers here.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.030
这并非战舰
This is not a warcraft.

00:54.030 --> 00:56.390
我重复  这并非战舰
I repeat, this is not a warcraft.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.950
听我说  你们应当开心
Hear me and rejoice.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.370
你们有幸
You have had the privilege

01:18.810 --> 01:21.790
被伟大泰坦所拯救
of being saved by the Great Titan.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.470
你们或许觉得这是折磨
You may think this is suffering.

01:27.900 --> 01:28.630
不是的
No.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.800
这是拯救
It is salvation.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.910
因为你们的牺牲
Universal scales tip toward balance

01:39.910 --> 01:41.940
宇宙的天平得以平衡
because of your sacrifice.

01:43.460 --> 01:44.480
笑笑吧
Smile.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.400
即便是死了
For even in death,

01:48.090 --> 01:51.030
你们也成为了灭霸的孩子
you have become Children of Thanos.

02:06.150 --> 02:08.380
我懂得失败的感觉
I know what it's like to lose.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.100
明明深切地知道你是对的
To feel so desperately that you're right...

02:14.030 --> 02:16.430
却还是失败了
yet to fail, nonetheless.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.280
是很可怕
It's frightening.

02:27.790 --> 02:29.900
让人的腿发软
Turns the legs to jelly.

02:32.010 --> 02:33.780
但我问你  这又何必
But I ask you, to what end?

02:35.590 --> 02:38.500
害怕  逃避
Dread it, run from it...

02:39.100 --> 02:41.500
命运总会到来
destiny arrives all the same.

02:42.770 --> 02:44.670
现在  它来了
And now, it's here.

02:45.270 --> 02:46.960
或者我该说
Or should I say...

02:48.440 --> 02:50.010
我来了
I am.

02:55.450 --> 02:56.970
你话太多了
You talk too much.

02:58.030 --> 02:59.430
宇宙魔方
The Tesseract.

02:59.910 --> 03:01.890
换你哥哥的脑袋
Or your brother's head.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.690
你应该有所取舍吧
I assume you have a preference.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.530
当然
Oh, I do.

03:14.170 --> 03:15.200
杀了他吧
Kill away.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.670
好吧  住手
All right, stop!

03:35.110 --> 03:37.110
宇宙魔方不在我们这儿
We don't have the Tesseract.

03:37.110 --> 03:39.100
它在阿斯加德上被毁了
It was destroyed on Asgard.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.860
你真是最差劲的弟弟
You really are the worst brother.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.030
我向你保证  哥哥
I assure you, brother...

03:59.680 --> 04:01.700
我们还会时来运转的
the sun will shine on us again.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.920
你的乐观用错了地方  阿斯加德人
Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.840
首先  我不是阿斯加德人
Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.420
另外
And for another...

04:14.610 --> 04:15.800
我们有绿巨人
we have a Hulk.

04:28.210 --> 04:29.770
让他玩吧
Let him have his fun.

05:22.180 --> 05:23.450
众神之父
Allfathers...

05:25.550 --> 05:28.830
让黑暗魔法最后一次
let the dark magic flow through me one last...

05:29.600 --> 05:30.330
流过我
time.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.180
那是个错误
That was a mistake.

05:52.710 --> 05:54.570
不
No!

06:03.720 --> 06:06.410
我会要你偿命的
You're going to die for that.

06:17.570 --> 06:19.550
卑微的我
My humble personage...

06:20.820 --> 06:23.350
向您的伟大臣服
bows before your grandeur.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.600
从没有过什么人  如此强大
No other being has ever had the might...

06:29.910 --> 06:31.600
如此崇高
nay, the nobility...

06:32.120 --> 06:36.780
能够操控不仅一枚  而是两枚无限宝石的力量
to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.

06:40.210 --> 06:44.530
宇宙已经唾手可得
The universe lies within your grasp.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.450
地球上还有两颗
There are two more stones on Earth.

07:28.140 --> 07:31.540
找到它们  我的孩子  带去泰坦星上给我
Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.560
父亲  我们不会辜负你的
Father, we will not fail you.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.710
容我插嘴
If I might interject.

07:36.190 --> 07:39.500
如果你们要去地球  你们或许需要向导
If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.840
我在这方面还有点经验
I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.570
如果你认为失败也算经验的话
If you consider failure experience.

07:45.570 --> 07:48.390
我认为经验就是经验
I consider experience experience.

07:49.450 --> 07:51.020
全能的灭霸
Almighty Thanos...

07:51.240 --> 07:55.970
我  洛基  阿斯加德王子
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

07:59.750 --> 08:00.730
奥丁森
Odinson...

08:04.880 --> 08:06.870
约顿海姆的合法国王
the rightful king of Jotunheim...

08:07.380 --> 08:09.580
恶作剧之神
god of mischief...

08:10.180 --> 08:12.370
在此向你宣誓
do hereby pledge to you...

08:13.100 --> 08:16.960
不死的忠诚
my undying fidelity.

08:27.650 --> 08:29.260
不死
Undying?

08:32.780 --> 08:35.560
你措辞该更小心点的
You should choose your words more carefully.

08:56.930 --> 08:57.710
你
You...

08:59.140 --> 09:00.630
永远不会成为
will never be...

09:03.440 --> 09:04.460
神
a god.

09:14.700 --> 09:15.850
不
No!

09:30.800 --> 09:33.120
这次别想复活了
No resurrections this time.

09:56.950 --> 09:59.020
不  洛基
No. Loki.

10:37.910 --> 10:40.770
说真的  你没有钱吗
Seriously, you don't have any money?

10:40.790 --> 10:44.160
对物质的依恋  就是与精神的断层
Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.540
我会把这话告诉熟食店的人的
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.630
或许他们能给你做个形而上黑面包火腿三明治
Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.590
等等  我好像有两百
Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

10:49.590 --> 10:50.450
美元吗
Dollars?

10:50.840 --> 10:52.070
-卢布  -那是多少
- Rupees. - Which is?

10:53.090 --> 10:53.990
1.5美元
Buck and a half.

10:54.340 --> 10:55.160
你想要什么
What do you want?

10:56.260 --> 10:58.580
金枪鱼三明治倒是不错
I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.220
灭霸要来了
Thanos is coming.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.220
他要来了
He's coming.

11:18.740 --> 11:19.390
谁
Who?

11:20.730 --> 11:28.160
复仇者联盟 3：无限战争

11:29.040 --> 11:29.830
慢点  慢点
Slow down, slow down.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.090
-我解释给你听  -你在说胡话呢
- I'll spell it out for you. - You're totally rambling.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.050
-没有啦  -我没听懂
- No, I'm not. - You lost me.

11:32.050 --> 11:33.710
你知道那种  做梦的时候
Look, you know how you're having a dream,

11:33.710 --> 11:34.840
觉得要上厕所的感觉吧
and in the dream you gotta pee.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.010
-嗯  -好
- Yeah. - Okay.

11:36.010 --> 11:37.090
然后你会发现  "天呐
And then you're like, "Oh, my God.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.840
怎么到处都没厕所  怎么办啊
"There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?

11:38.840 --> 11:39.690
-有人在看啊"  -是啊
- "Oh, someone's watching." - Right.

11:39.690 --> 11:41.010
-"我要尿裤子了"  -然后你醒过来
- "Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants." - And then you wake up

11:41.010 --> 11:42.760
发现你其实是真想尿尿
and in real life you actually have to pee.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.020
-没错  -嗯
- Yes. - Yeah.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.270
-好  -每个人都做这种梦
- Okay. - Everybody has that.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.090
是啊  这就是我想说的
Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

11:47.350 --> 11:51.380
关于这一点  昨晚  我梦到我们生了个孩子
Apropos of that, last night I dreamt we had a kid.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.010
感觉可真了
It was so real.

11:53.570 --> 11:55.280
我们还以一个奇怪的叔叔给他起了名
We named him after your eccentric uncle.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.150
他叫什么来着
Uh, what was his name?

11:56.150 --> 11:58.180
-哦  -摩根  摩根
- Right. - Morgan! Morgan.

11:58.570 --> 12:00.530
-于是你醒来  -当然了
- So you woke up... - Naturally.

12:00.530 --> 12:01.810
觉得我们...
...and thought that we were...

12:02.160 --> 12:03.370
-要有了  -嗯
- Expecting. - Yeah.

12:03.370 --> 12:04.330
-有吗  -没有
- Yes? - No.

12:04.330 --> 12:05.910
我梦到了  可真了
I had a dream about it. It was so real.

12:05.910 --> 12:07.270
如果你想要孩子
If you wanted to have a kid...

12:07.960 --> 12:09.190
你就不会这么做了
you wouldn't have done that.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.960
我很高兴你提到了这个  因为这没什么
I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.670
就是纳米粒子的储存器
It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

12:13.670 --> 12:15.000
这话是帮倒忙
You're not helping your case, okay?

12:15.010 --> 12:16.460
不  这是能拆掉的
No, this is detachable. It's not a...

12:16.470 --> 12:17.870
你不需要它
You don't need that.

12:18.260 --> 12:19.180
我知道  我做了手术
I know, I had the surgery.

12:19.180 --> 12:20.660
我就是想保护我们
I'm just trying to protect us...

12:21.010 --> 12:22.430
还有未来更多的我们什么的
and future usses and that's it.

12:22.430 --> 12:24.310
以防衣橱里藏了怪物
Just in case there's a monster in the closet.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.080
-而不是  -衬衫
- Instead of, you know... - Shirts.

12:27.730 --> 12:28.810
你好了解我
You know me so well.

12:28.810 --> 12:31.630
-天呐  -你还能接我的话
- God. - You finish all my sentences.

12:32.610 --> 12:34.720
你的衣橱里该放衬衣
You should have shirts in your closet.

12:34.780 --> 12:35.510
是啊
Yeah.

12:36.610 --> 12:38.490
知道该有什么吗  再不制造意外了
You know what there should be? No more surprises.

12:38.490 --> 12:39.860
我们今晚好好吃顿晚饭
We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

Show off this Harry Winston.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.580
是吧  今后再不制造什么意外了
Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever.

12:44.580 --> 12:45.790
我要向你保证
I should promise you.

12:45.790 --> 12:47.060
-好  -真的
- Yes. - I will.

12:49.620 --> 12:50.480
谢谢
Thank you.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.440
托尼·斯塔克
Tony Stark.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.240
我是斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士  我需要你跟我来
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.450
恭喜你们要结婚了
Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.700
抱歉  你是卖票的吗
I'm sorry, you giving out tickets to something?

13:01.720 --> 13:02.830
我们需要你帮忙
We need your help.

13:03.930 --> 13:05.220
可以不夸张地说
It's not overselling it to say that

13:05.220 --> 13:07.220
这事关全宇宙的命运
the fate of the universe is at stake.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.420
"我们"是谁
And who's "we"?

13:10.480 --> 13:11.420
托尼
Hey, Tony.

13:11.770 --> 13:12.460
布鲁斯
Bruce.

13:12.900 --> 13:13.670
派珀
Pepper.

13:17.730 --> 13:18.550
你没事吧
You okay?

13:20.860 --> 13:22.890
宇宙之初
At the dawn of the universe,

13:23.240 --> 13:25.350
是一片虚无  然后...
there was nothing. Then...

13:27.540 --> 13:30.860
大爆炸把六颗元素水晶
The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...

13:30.870 --> 13:33.360
抛到了新宇宙的深处
hurtling across the virgin universe.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.130
这些无限宝石
These Infinity Stones

13:36.130 --> 13:39.200
每一颗都控制一种存在的必要方面
each control an essential aspect of existence.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.320
空间
Space.

13:42.590 --> 13:43.620
现实
Reality.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.120
力量
Power.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.790
灵魂
Soul.

13:50.020 --> 13:50.960
心灵
Mind.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.250
还有时间
And Time.

14:04.070 --> 14:05.140
再跟我说一遍他的名字
Tell me his name again.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.270
灭霸
Thanos.

14:06.660 --> 14:07.740
他就像瘟疫  托尼
He's a plague, Tony.

14:07.740 --> 14:09.910
他入侵星球  想拿什么就拿什么
He invades planets. He takes what he wants.

14:09.910 --> 14:12.250
抹去半数人口
He wipes out half the population.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.690
当初是他派洛基来的
He sent Loki.

14:14.670 --> 14:17.320
纽约的袭击  是他搞的鬼
The attack on New York, that's him.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.200
决战来了
This is it.

14:20.670 --> 14:21.460
我们还有多少时间
What's our timeline?

14:21.470 --> 14:23.930
不知道  他拿到了力量和空间宝石
No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones.

14:23.930 --> 14:26.720
这已经使他成为全宇宙最有威力的人了
That already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.850
如果他拿到全部六颗宝石  托尼
If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony...

14:29.850 --> 14:33.560
他能以前所未有的方式毁灭生命
He could destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.520
你刚刚真的说了"前所未有的方式"吗
Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?

14:35.520 --> 14:37.810
你真的要倚在宇宙大锅上吗
Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

14:37.810 --> 14:38.840
是叫这个吗
Is that what it is?

14:42.030 --> 14:43.800
我就不跟你计较了
I'm going to allow that.

14:46.030 --> 14:47.070
如果灭霸需要全部六颗
If Thanos needs all six,

14:47.070 --> 14:49.030
那我们何不毁了这颗
why don't we just stick this one down a garbage disposal?

14:49.030 --> 14:50.080
不行
No can do.

14:50.080 --> 14:53.290
我们曾起誓要以性命维护时间宝石
We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives.

14:53.290 --> 14:54.560
我还曾起誓要戒掉乳制品
And I swore off dairy...

14:54.580 --> 14:56.920
但班杰瑞以我命名了一种冰淇淋口味
but then Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.710
-斯塔克狂热榛仁  -不赖啊
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts. - Not bad.

14:58.710 --> 14:59.920
有点牙碜
A bit chalky.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.000
我最喜欢大块绿巨人热巧克力
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge is our favorite.

15:02.010 --> 15:02.920
-有这玩意吗  -不重要
- That's a thing? - Whatever.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.510
重点是  情况会变
Point is, things change.

15:04.510 --> 15:07.340
我们保护时间宝石的誓言不能改变
Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.300
这颗宝石可能是我们对抗灭霸的最佳机会了
And this stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.220
那么反过来
Yeah, so conversely,

15:10.220 --> 15:12.600
也可能是他对抗我们的最佳机会
it may also be his best chance against us.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.180

事实就是  我们有这颗宝石
The fact is we have this stone.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.100

那谁能找到幻视
Who could find Vision then?

把它弄掉
Get it off.

29:32.290 --> 29:34.610
这哥们怎么会还活着
How the hell is this dude still alive?

29:35.210 --> 29:36.610
他不是个"哥们"
He is not a dude.

29:37.170 --> 29:38.280
你是个哥们
You're a dude.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.530
这  是个男人
This... This is a man.

29:42.510 --> 29:45.250
一个帅气的肌肉男
A handsome, muscular man.

29:45.390 --> 29:46.050
我也挺肌肉的
I'm muscular.

29:46.060 --> 29:47.310
你骗谁呢  奎尔
But who are you kidding, Quill?

29:47.310 --> 29:49.100
你再吃一个三明治就是一身肥膘了
You're one sandwich away from fat.

29:49.100 --> 29:49.930
得了吧
Yeah, right.

29:49.930 --> 29:51.770
没错  奎尔  你是胖了点
It's true, Quill. You have put on weight.

29:51.770 --> 29:52.500
什么
What?

29:54.940 --> 29:56.340
卡魔拉  你也觉得我...
Gamora, do you think I'm...

29:59.190 --> 30:02.470
他很焦虑  生气
He is anxious, angry.

30:02.740 --> 30:06.020
他失去了很多  非常愧疚
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

30:06.700 --> 30:09.560
简直就像一个海盗跟一个天使生了个孩子
It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

30:10.710 --> 30:12.540
这对我真是一记警钟啊  好吧
This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.

30:12.540 --> 30:15.380
我去买个博飞健身器  认真减肥
I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.670
再去弄个哑铃
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

30:16.670 --> 30:18.130
你知道哑铃是不能吃的吧
You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

30:18.130 --> 30:21.550
他的肌肉就像是柯塔蒂金属纤维做的
It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.

30:21.550 --> 30:23.530
别给他的肌肉按摩了
Stop massaging his muscles.

30:25.430 --> 30:26.160
弄醒他
Wake him up.

30:29.180 --> 30:30.040
醒来
Wake.

30:47.620 --> 30:49.520
你们是谁
Who the hell are you guys?

30:52.790 --> 30:56.150
自从我认识灭霸  他就只有一个目标
The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.

30:56.540 --> 30:58.040
让宇宙获得平衡
To bring balance to the universe

30:58.040 --> 31:00.150
方法是抹去一半生命
by wiping out half of all life.

31:00.880 --> 31:03.370
他以前会一个个星球地杀人
He used to kill people planet by planet,

31:03.470 --> 31:05.330
一次次地进行屠杀
massacre by massacre.

31:05.380 --> 31:06.580
包括我的星球
Including my own.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.550
如果他拿到全部六颗无限宝石
If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

31:08.550 --> 31:11.210
那他打一个响指就能实现愿望
he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.

31:11.810 --> 31:14.080
你似乎对灭霸很了解
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

31:14.690 --> 31:18.710
卡魔拉是灭霸的女儿
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.800
你父亲杀了我弟弟
Your father killed my brother.

31:24.900 --> 31:25.850
天呐
Oh, boy.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.070
严格讲是继父
Stepfather, technically.

31:28.070 --> 31:29.770
她跟你一样恨他
And she hates him as much as you do.

31:33.660 --> 31:34.980
家家有本难念的经
Families can be tough.

31:35.290 --> 31:36.620
我父亲死前
Before my father died,

31:36.620 --> 31:38.750
才跟我说我还有个异母姐姐
he told me that I had a half-sister...

31:38.750 --> 31:40.320
被他囚禁在了地狱
that he imprisoned in Hel.

31:41.090 --> 31:44.210
然后她回了家  捅瞎了我的眼睛
And then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.

31:44.220 --> 31:45.760
于是我不得不杀了她
So I had to kill her.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.490
人生啊  是吧
That's life though, isn't it, I guess.

31:47.930 --> 31:49.450
兜兜转转
Goes round and round and...

31:50.100 --> 31:50.930
我能理解你的痛苦
I feel your pain.

31:50.930 --> 31:53.560
我也能理解你的痛苦
I feel your pain as well, because...

31:53.560 --> 31:54.520
虽然这不是比赛
I mean, it's not a competition,

31:54.520 --> 31:56.230
但我也吃过不少苦
but I've been through a lot.

31:56.230 --> 31:57.890
我父亲杀了我妈
My father killed my mother.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.800
然后我不得不杀了我爸
And then I had to kill my father.

31:59.940 --> 32:01.050
那可痛苦了
That was hard.

32:01.150 --> 32:03.510
可能比杀姐姐还痛苦
Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.

32:04.150 --> 32:07.450
而且我还两眼完好无损地回来了
Plus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...

32:07.450 --> 32:09.350
我需要一把锤子  不是勺子
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

32:10.910 --> 32:13.640
这玩意怎么开  有什么...
How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of, uh...

32:14.370 --> 32:17.360
四位密码  是生日吗
A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.400
-你干什么呢  -开走你们的飞行舱
- What are you doing? - Taking your pod.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.110
你别想
No, you're not.

32:24.960 --> 32:28.830
你今天别想开走我们的飞行舱  先生
You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.160
奎尔  你是在故意把嗓音压低吗
Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

32:34.810 --> 32:36.170
-没有  -就有
- No. - You are.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.440
你在模仿那个男神  好奇怪
You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.460
我没有
No, I'm not.

32:40.560 --> 32:43.510
-他又来了  -我的嗓音就是这样
- He just did it again! - This is my voice.

32:49.070 --> 32:50.180
你在嘲笑我吗
Are you mocking me?

32:50.570 --> 32:53.230
-你在嘲笑我吗  -别闹了  你又那样了
- Are you mocking me? - Stop it. You did it again.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.410
他想模仿我
He's trying to copy me.

32:55.410 --> 32:56.250
你给我停下
I need you to stop doing that.

32:56.250 --> 32:57.910
-够了  -他先开始的
- Enough! - He's doing it first.

32:57.910 --> 32:59.580
我们得阻止灭霸
We need to stop Thanos.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.210
所以  我们得查明
Which means we need to find out

33:01.210 --> 33:02.130
他接下来要去哪
where he's going next.

33:02.130 --> 33:03.110
虚无知地 [不去哪]
Knowhere.

33:03.710 --> 33:05.460
他肯定会去什么地方的
He must be going somewhere.

33:05.460 --> 33:07.240
不对  虚无知地吗
No, no. Knowhere?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.870
那是个地方  我们去过  烂爆了
It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

33:10.550 --> 33:12.790
-抱歉  那是我们的食物  -现在不是了
- Excuse me, that's our food. - Not anymore.

33:13.390 --> 33:16.420
托尔  他为什么要去虚无知地
Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

33:16.720 --> 33:17.930
因为多年来
Because for years...

33:17.930 --> 33:20.270
现实宝石一直安全地放在那里
the Reality Stone's been safely stored there

33:20.270 --> 33:21.850
在一个叫收藏者的人手上
with a man called the Collector.

33:21.850 --> 33:23.860
如果是在收藏者手上  那就不安全了
If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe.

33:23.860 --> 33:25.400
只有白痴才会把宝石交给那人
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.980
-或是天才  -你怎么知道
- Or a genius. - How do you know...

33:26.980 --> 33:29.180
他不会去找其他的哪颗宝石
he's not going for one of the other stones?

33:29.650 --> 33:31.680
一共有六颗宝石
There are six stones out there.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.700
灭霸已经拿到了力量宝石
Thanos already has the Power Stone...

33:34.700 --> 33:38.270
那是他上周摧毁山达尔星时偷走的
because he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.440
他从我这儿偷走了空间宝石
He stole the Space Stone from me...

33:40.540 --> 33:43.360
还摧毁了我的飞船  杀了我一半人民
when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.540
时间和心灵宝石在地球上很安全
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.

33:45.540 --> 33:46.540
在复仇者联盟手里
They're with the Avengers.

33:46.550 --> 33:48.920
-复仇者联盟  -地球最强大的英雄
- The Avengers? - Earth's mightiest heroes.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.010
就像凯文·贝肯吗
Like Kevin Bacon?

33:50.010 --> 33:51.420
或许有他吧  我不知道
He may be on the team. I don't know.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.800
我挺久没回去了
I haven't been there in a while.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.260
至于灵魂宝石  根本没人见过
As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that.

33:55.260 --> 33:56.710
都没人知道它在哪
No one even knows where it is.

33:56.930 --> 33:58.640
因此灭霸得不到它
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.350
因此他会去虚无知地
Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

34:00.350 --> 34:02.670
好拿到现实宝石
Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

34:03.020 --> 34:03.800
不客气
You're welcome.

34:03.850 --> 34:05.520
那我们得马上去虚无知地
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

34:05.520 --> 34:09.680
不  我们得去尼德威阿尔
Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

34:09.740 --> 34:11.610
-那个词是编出来的  -所有词都是编出来的
- That's a made-up word. - All words are made up.

34:11.610 --> 34:14.720
尼德威阿尔是真的  你认真的吗
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

34:14.870 --> 34:16.120
那地方是个传奇
That place is a legend.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.270
他们能造出最强大  最可怕的武器
They make the most powerful, horrific weapons

34:18.370 --> 34:20.080
来折腾整个宇宙
to ever torment the universe.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.370
我可是非常愿意去的
I would very much like to go there, please.

34:22.370 --> 34:23.330
这只兔子说的对
The rabbit is correct

34:23.330 --> 34:25.040
它显然是你们当中最聪明的
and clearly the smartest among you.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.950
-兔子  -只有矮人伊特里能造出我需要的武器
- Rabbit?  - Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me the weapon I need.

34:28.670 --> 34:29.880
你就是船长吧  先生
I assume you're the captain, sir.

34:29.880 --> 34:30.960
有眼光
You're very perceptive.

34:30.970 --> 34:32.300
你看起来像个高贵的领袖
You seem like a noble leader.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.050
你愿意跟我一起去尼德威阿尔吗
Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

34:34.050 --> 34:37.050
让我问下船长  等一下  我就是船长
Let me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me!

34:37.050 --> 34:38.710
-好  我加入  -太棒了
- Yeah. I'll go. - Wonderful!

34:39.100 --> 34:40.560
不过  我才是船长
Except for that I'm the captain.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.100
安静
Quiet.

34:41.100 --> 34:42.980
-那是我的背包  -坐下吧你
- That's my backpack. - Go sit down.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.770
这是我的飞船
Look, this is my ship.

34:44.770 --> 34:46.130
我才不会去什么...
And I'm not goin' to...

34:47.570 --> 34:49.860
等一下  那是什么样的武器
Wait, what kinda weapon are we talkin' about here?

34:49.860 --> 34:51.550
能杀灭霸的那种
The Thanos-killing kind.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.610
你不觉得我们每个人都应该弄把那样的武器吗
Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

34:53.610 --> 34:55.780
不  你们没有驾驭它们的力量
No. You simply lack the strength to wield them.

34:55.780 --> 34:56.740
你们的身体会碎裂
Your bodies would crumble

34:56.740 --> 34:58.410
思维会崩溃  甚至疯掉
as your minds collapsed into madness.

34:58.410 --> 35:00.160
我现在更想要了  会不会很奇怪
Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

35:00.160 --> 35:01.240
没错  是有一点
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.830
如果我们不去虚无知地
If we don't go to Knowhere

35:02.830 --> 35:04.710
而灭霸又得到一颗宝石
and Thanos retrieves another stone...

35:04.710 --> 35:06.250
他就会强大得不可阻挡了
he'll be too powerful to stop.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.920
-他已经不可阻挡了  -我有办法了
- He already is. - I got it figured out.

35:08.920 --> 35:10.460
我们有两艘船
We got two ships

35:10.460 --> 35:12.420
和一群各种各样的白痴
and a large assortment of morons.

35:12.420 --> 35:15.050
我和格鲁特跟这位海盗天使走
So me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here.

35:15.050 --> 35:16.680
白痴们去虚无知地
And the morons will go to Knowhere

35:16.680 --> 35:18.540
试图阻止灭霸
to try to stop Thanos.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.810
-好吗  好  -很好
- Cool? Cool. - So cool.

35:20.810 --> 35:21.750
顺便说一句
For the record...

35:22.810 --> 35:23.930
我知道你跟他走
I know that you're going with him

35:23.930 --> 35:25.390
是因为灭霸不在那里
because it's where Thanos isn't.

35:25.390 --> 35:26.810
你真的不应该
You know, you really shouldn't

35:26.810 --> 35:29.590
这样跟你的船长讲话  奎尔
talk that way to your captain, Quill.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.470
走了  格鲁特
Come on, Groot.

35:32.110 --> 35:34.550
把游戏放下  你的脑子会烂掉的
Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.020
再会了  祝你们好运  白痴们
I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

35:41.490 --> 35:42.230
再见
Bye.

35:57.340 --> 35:58.290
小幻
Vis?

35:58.970 --> 36:00.500
又是宝石
Is it the stone again?

36:01.060 --> 36:02.710
它好像在跟我说话
It's as if it's speaking to me.

36:03.270 --> 36:04.460
它说什么
What does it say?

36:05.940 --> 36:08.590
我...不知道  但它说了些什么
I don't... I don't know, but something.

36:21.620 --> 36:23.020
告诉我你感觉到了什么
Tell me what you feel.

36:31.090 --> 36:33.200
我只感觉到了你
I just feel you.

36:41.250 --> 36:47.170
苏  格  兰

36:41.970 --> 36:43.850
10点有一班去格拉斯哥的列车
So there's a 10:00 A.M. to Glasgow...

36:43.850 --> 36:46.060
这样你回去之前  我们还能一起多待会儿
which would give us more time together before you went back.

36:46.060 --> 36:47.460
如果我错过那班车呢
What if I miss that train?

36:47.810 --> 36:48.890
11点还有一班
There's an 11:00.

36:48.890 --> 36:50.880
如果我错过所有车次呢
What if I missed all the trains?

36:52.820 --> 36:54.650
这次我不回去了怎么样
What if this time I didn't go back?

36:54.650 --> 36:56.070
但你向斯塔克承诺过
But you gave Stark your word.

36:56.070 --> 36:57.490
我更想向你许下承诺
I'd rather give it to you.

36:57.490 --> 36:59.570
也有人在等我回去
Well, there are people who are expecting me too, you know.

36:59.570 --> 37:01.030
我们都做过承诺
We both made promises.

37:01.030 --> 37:02.100
但没有对彼此承诺
Not to each other.

37:03.530 --> 37:04.350
旺达
Wanda.

37:05.080 --> 37:07.700
两年了  我们偷来了这些相处的时光
For two years, we've stolen these moments...

37:07.710 --> 37:09.270
想看看我们是不是合得来
trying to see if this could work and...

37:09.710 --> 37:10.820
我不知道
I don't know.

37:11.580 --> 37:13.460
我只想说说自己的看法
You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.

37:13.460 --> 37:15.800
我觉得...
I think...

37:15.800 --> 37:16.880
-我们合得来  -是啊
- It works. - It works.

37:16.880 --> 37:17.780
是啊
It works.

37:20.630 --> 37:21.580
留下来
Stay.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.040
留下陪我
Stay with me.

37:29.350 --> 37:32.090
或者算了  如果我出格了
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

37:34.760 --> 37:38.350
<b>纽约被袭击</b>

37:39.530 --> 37:41.100
它们是什么
What are they?

37:41.610 --> 37:43.970
正是宝石警告我的东西
What the stone was warning me about.

37:44.020 --> 37:47.110
<b>托尼·斯塔克失踪</b>

37:54.000 --> 37:55.030
我得走了
I have to go.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.650
不  幻视
No, Vision.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.360
幻视  如果那是真的
Vision, if that's true,

37:59.260 --> 38:01.410
那也许回去不是最好的选择
then maybe going isn't the best idea.

38:02.220 --> 38:03.240
旺达  我...
Wanda, I...

38:03.800 --> 38:04.700
幻视
Vision!

38:33.580 --> 38:36.490
那刀刃  让我无法瞬移
The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.820
-那可能吗  -不该这样的
- Is that even possible? - It isn't supposed to be.

38:40.340 --> 38:42.030
我的系统正在崩溃
My systems are failing.

38:42.880 --> 38:46.040
我开始觉得我们不该下床了
I'm beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.

38:48.060 --> 38:48.750
小幻
Vis!

38:58.270 --> 39:02.010
放弃宝石  她才能活
Give up the stone, and she lives.

39:39.610 --> 39:40.720
放开他
Hands off.

39:56.620 --> 39:57.980
快  快
Come on. Come on.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.780
快  你得站起来
Come on, you gotta get up.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.360
你得站起来  快
You gotta get up. Come on.

40:04.010 --> 40:04.780
我们得走了
We have to go.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.040
拜托  你走吧
Please. Please leave.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.700
你让我留下来的
You asked me to stay.

40:12.510 --> 40:13.830
-我要留下  -拜托
- I'm staying. - Please.

41:24.920 --> 41:26.700
-起来  -我起不来
- Get up. - I can't.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.120
我们不想杀你  但我们不会手软的
We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

41:29.630 --> 41:31.620
过时不候
You'll never get the chance again.

41:47.730 --> 41:48.680
你能站起来吗
Can you stand?

41:54.200 --> 41:55.560
谢谢你  队长
Thank you, Captain.

41:58.290 --> 41:59.350
先扶你上飞机吧
Let's get you on the jet.

42:03.790 --> 42:06.740
我们不是说好了吗
Now, I thought we had a deal.

42:07.460 --> 42:11.340
别走太远  保持联系  不要冒险
Stay close, check in, don't take any chances.

42:11.340 --> 42:12.240
对不起
I'm sorry.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.290
我们只是需要时间
We just wanted time.

42:17.350 --> 42:18.370
去哪里  队长
Where to, Cap?

42:21.440 --> 42:22.250
回家
Home.

42:26.150 --> 42:28.840
我们会安全的  会安全的
We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

42:53.220 --> 42:54.300
泽霍贝瑞人
Zehobereians.

42:54.300 --> 42:55.800
母亲  我母亲呢
Mother! Where's my mother?

42:55.800 --> 42:57.720
不选一边就要死
Choose a side or die.

42:57.720 --> 42:58.750
母亲
Mother!

42:59.430 --> 43:01.710
一边是启示
One side is a revelation...

43:01.980 --> 43:05.050
另一边是只有少数人拥有的荣誉
the other an honor known only to a few.

43:05.730 --> 43:07.210
你怎么了  小家伙
What's wrong, little one?

43:07.810 --> 43:11.220
我母亲  我母亲在哪
My mother. Where is my mother?

43:15.950 --> 43:17.020
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

43:18.530 --> 43:19.430
我叫卡魔拉
Gamora.

43:20.740 --> 43:22.600
你很有斗志  卡魔拉
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

43:24.330 --> 43:25.110
来
Come.

43:25.830 --> 43:26.820
我来帮你
Let me help you.

43:40.260 --> 43:41.290
你看
Look.

43:44.980 --> 43:46.000
很漂亮是吧
Pretty, isn't it?

43:47.480 --> 43:50.880
平衡感恰到好处  正是一切事物应有的样子
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

43:51.110 --> 43:54.720
左右偏移太多的话...
Too much to one side or the other...

43:58.780 --> 44:01.770
给  你试试
Here. You try.

44:05.500 --> 44:09.190
安详地去见你们的造物主吧
Now, go in peace to meet your maker.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.070
集中注意力
Concentrate.

44:18.300 --> 44:21.290
这就对了  你掌握了
There. You've got it.

44:30.560 --> 44:31.340
卡魔拉
Gamora.

44:32.770 --> 44:33.610
你知不知道这些手榴弹
Do you know if these grenades

44:33.610 --> 44:36.320
是炸掉蛋蛋的  还是毒气弹
are the blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

44:36.320 --> 44:37.000
因为我想
Because I was thinking about

44:37.000 --> 44:39.180
在皮带上挂几个
hanging a couple on my belt right here.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.070
但我可不想被炸...
But I don't want to if they're the...

44:40.070 --> 44:41.520
我需要你帮忙
I need to ask a favor.

44:42.450 --> 44:43.480
当然
Yeah, sure.

44:45.290 --> 44:46.250
不管怎样
One way or another,

44:46.250 --> 44:48.730
我们都会与灭霸交手的
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

44:50.460 --> 44:52.530
这就是手榴弹的用处
Which is what the grenades are for.

44:53.630 --> 44:55.660
抱歉  你要我帮什么忙
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

44:57.470 --> 44:58.780
如果事情出了岔子
If things go wrong...

45:00.260 --> 45:02.250
如果灭霸抓到了我
If Thanos gets me...

45:06.930 --> 45:08.670
我要你答应我
I want you to promise me...

45:09.900 --> 45:10.920
你会杀了我
you'll kill me.

45:11.860 --> 45:12.630
什么
What?

45:15.900 --> 45:18.300
我知道一些他不知道的事
I know something he doesn't.

45:20.950 --> 45:22.390
如果他知道了
And if he finds it out,

45:23.120 --> 45:25.200
那整个宇宙都有危险了
the entire universe could be at risk.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.330
你知道什么
What do you know?

45:26.330 --> 45:28.190
如果我告诉你  你也知道了
If I tell you, you'd know too.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.230
如果这事如此重要
If it's so important...

45:33.460 --> 45:34.440
难道我不该知道吗
shouldn't I?

45:34.630 --> 45:35.750
除非你想死
Only if you wanna die.

45:35.750 --> 45:37.990
为什么总有人要死
Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

45:39.090 --> 45:39.820
你就
Just...

45:42.430 --> 45:45.370
相信我  可能还要杀了我
Trust me. And possibly kill me.

45:45.510 --> 45:47.890
我倒是愿意
I mean, I'd like to.

45:47.890 --> 45:49.830
真的  但是你...
I really would. But you...

45:50.020 --> 45:51.210
向我发誓
Swear to me.

45:54.820 --> 45:56.510
以你母亲的名义向我发誓
Swear to me on your mother.

46:04.450 --> 46:05.180
好
Okay.

46:11.210 --> 46:11.940
好吧
Okay.

46:28.930 --> 46:29.810
老兄
Dude.

46:29.810 --> 46:31.380
你在那里站了多久
How long have you been standing there?

46:31.600 --> 46:32.460
一小时
An hour.

46:32.810 --> 46:33.840
一小时
An hour?

46:34.690 --> 46:35.840
你不是吧
Are you serious?

46:36.110 --> 46:37.880
我已经掌握了
I've mastered the ability

46:38.230 --> 46:41.180
纹丝不动站立的能力
of standing so incredibly still...

46:42.400 --> 46:44.510
肉眼是看不到我的
that I become invisible to the eye.

46:45.490 --> 46:46.310
看好了
Watch.

46:49.870 --> 46:51.940
你在吃花生糖呢
You're eating a zarg-nut.

46:52.500 --> 46:53.570
但是我的动作
But my movement...

46:54.670 --> 46:56.030
如此缓慢
was so slow...

46:57.130 --> 46:58.590
令人难以察觉
that it's imperceptible.

46:58.590 --> 47:00.240
不是
Mmm, no.

47:01.590 --> 47:02.670
我坚信没人能看到我
I'm sure I'm invisible.

47:02.670 --> 47:04.120
德拉克斯
Hi, Drax.

47:06.600 --> 47:07.450
该死的
Damn it.

47:19.800 --> 47:24.770
虚  无  知  地

47:27.490 --> 47:29.140
这地方似乎已经荒废了
This place looks deserted.

47:29.490 --> 47:32.080
第三象限有动静
I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

47:32.080 --> 47:34.020
没错  我也看到了
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

47:35.710 --> 47:37.070
我们在这里降落吧
Let's put down right here.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.000
东西不在我这里
I don't have it.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.100
银河系的人都知道
Everyone in the galaxy knows

47:54.100 --> 47:55.940
你愿出卖亲兄弟
you'd sell your own brother...

47:55.940 --> 47:57.560
来为你可悲的收藏
if you thought it would add even the slightest trinket

47:57.560 --> 47:59.420
增添一点小装饰品
to your pathetic collection.

48:07.450 --> 48:10.180
我知道现实宝石在你手上  蒂万
I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

48:10.740 --> 48:14.350
把宝石交给我  你就不必遭受折磨
Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

48:17.540 --> 48:18.820
我和你说了
I told you.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.240
我卖掉了
I sold it.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.800
我为什么要骗你
Why would I lie?

48:25.800 --> 48:28.240
我想骗人是你的天性
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

48:29.300 --> 48:30.840
那是自杀
Like suicide.

48:30.850 --> 48:32.750
看来你明白啊
You do understand.

48:33.260 --> 48:36.130
就算是你也不会交出如此宝贵的东西
Not even you would surrender something so precious.

48:36.130 --> 48:38.160
我当时并不知道它是什么
I didn't know what it was.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.730
那你比我想的还蠢
Then you're more of a fool than I took you for.

48:41.340 --> 48:41.850
是他
It's him.

48:41.850 --> 48:43.810
最后的机会  你这骗子
Last chance, charlatan.

48:45.250 --> 48:46.820
宝石呢
Where's the stone?

48:47.510 --> 48:48.350
今天
Today...

48:49.010 --> 48:49.770
德拉克斯
Drax. Drax.

48:49.770 --> 48:52.200
他要为我妻女的死付出代价
...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.450
德拉克斯  等等
Drax, wait.

48:54.630 --> 48:56.030
别急  别急
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.010
德拉克斯
Drax.

49:01.250 --> 49:03.590
德拉克斯  听我说
Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

49:03.590 --> 49:05.650
他还没拿到宝石
He doesn't have the stone yet.

49:06.130 --> 49:08.420
如果我们拿到宝石  就能阻止他
If we get it, then we can stop him.

49:08.570 --> 49:11.570
我们得先拿到宝石  没错
We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

49:11.990 --> 49:12.670
不
No.

49:13.120 --> 49:16.350
不  为了奥薇特  为了卡玛莉亚
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

49:16.760 --> 49:18.040
睡吧
Sleep.

49:30.200 --> 49:30.930
好吧
Okay.

49:31.090 --> 49:35.480
卡魔拉  螳螂  你们去右边
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

49:36.680 --> 49:38.080
另一个右边
The other right.

50:02.150 --> 50:03.670
为什么
Why?

50:13.770 --> 50:17.290
为什么是你  女儿
Why you, daughter?

50:36.550 --> 50:37.630
好快啊
That was quick.

50:43.280 --> 50:48.220
了不起  了不起  了不起
Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

50:50.540 --> 50:53.430
你难过了吗  女儿
Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?

50:56.380 --> 50:58.890
我心里知道  你依然在乎我
In my heart, I knew you still cared.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.600
但毕竟没法确定
But one never knows for sure.

51:18.740 --> 51:21.250
现实往往令人失望
Reality is often disappointing.

51:24.750 --> 51:26.660
至少以前是的
That is, it was.

51:28.970 --> 51:29.830
现在
Now...

51:32.500 --> 51:35.280
现实可以任我摆布了
reality can be whatever I want.

51:36.730 --> 51:38.030
你早知道我会来
You knew I'd come.

51:38.370 --> 51:39.860
我就指望着呢
I counted on it.

51:40.740 --> 51:43.120
我们需要谈谈  小家伙
There's something we need to discuss, little one.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.030
灭霸
Thanos!

51:57.760 --> 51:58.790
不
No!

52:03.150 --> 52:04.810
放了她  奶昔大哥
Let her go, Grimace.

52:05.360 --> 52:06.160
彼得
Peter.

52:07.620 --> 52:09.020
我叫你走右边的
I told you to go right.

52:09.380 --> 52:10.790
现在还说这个
Now? Really?

52:10.790 --> 52:12.180
你放了她
You let her go!

52:12.650 --> 52:14.710
你是那个男友
Ah, the boyfriend.

52:14.710 --> 52:15.510
不
No.

52:15.790 --> 52:17.120
我更喜欢自视为
Like to think of myself more as a

52:17.130 --> 52:19.860
杀泰坦的长期炮友
Titan-killing, long-term booty call.

52:19.860 --> 52:21.940
-放了她  -彼得
- Let her go. - Peter.

52:21.940 --> 52:26.760
否则我轰掉你阴囊一样的下巴
I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face.

52:27.180 --> 52:28.130
不是他
Not him.

52:39.210 --> 52:42.540
你答应过我  你答应了
You promised. You promised.

52:47.150 --> 52:48.310
女儿
Oh, daughter.

52:48.750 --> 52:50.710
你对他提的要求他做不到
You expect too much from him.

52:54.980 --> 52:56.710
她跟你提过了  是吧
She's asked, hasn't she?

53:00.410 --> 53:01.110
动手吧
Do it.

53:07.690 --> 53:08.660
动手
Do it!

53:16.020 --> 53:17.490
我叫你走右边的
I told you to go right.

53:19.350 --> 53:21.570
我爱你超过一切
I love you more than anything.

53:25.560 --> 53:26.670
我也爱你
I love you too.

53:41.260 --> 53:42.480
我喜欢他
I like him.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.600
幻视还没消息吗
Still no word from Vision?

54:14.950 --> 54:17.600
卫星在爱丁堡附近跟丢了他
Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

54:17.630 --> 54:19.240
驾驶盗走的昆式战斗机
On a stolen Quinjet

54:19.240 --> 54:21.580
还有四个全球头号通缉犯
with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

54:21.580 --> 54:22.800
你知道他们是"罪犯"
You know they're only criminals

54:22.800 --> 54:24.870
只是因为你非要那么称呼他们
because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

54:24.870 --> 54:25.790
天呐  罗德
My God, Rhodes.

54:25.790 --> 54:29.280
你鬼扯的本事能跟我有一拼了
Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

54:29.280 --> 54:30.660
要不是因为《协议》
If it weren't for those Accords,

54:30.660 --> 54:32.580
幻视根本不会走
Vision would've been right here.

54:32.970 --> 54:36.210
我记得你也签了那份文件  中校
I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

54:36.740 --> 54:37.550
是啊
That's right.

54:39.810 --> 54:41.500
我也为此付出了代价
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

54:41.720 --> 54:43.170
你后悔了吗
You have second thoughts?

54:43.170 --> 54:44.360
现在没了
Not anymore.

54:50.610 --> 54:51.810
国务卿先生
Mr. Secretary.

54:56.780 --> 54:58.450
你好大胆
You got some nerve.

54:58.980 --> 55:00.150
这我承认
I'll give you that.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.630
你现在正需要点胆呢
You could use some of that right now.

55:03.580 --> 55:05.380
世界有危险了
The world's on fire.

55:06.460 --> 55:09.830
你觉得一切都被原谅了吗
And you think all is forgiven?

55:10.210 --> 55:11.810
我想要的不是原谅
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

55:12.060 --> 55:13.980
我更不想征求同意了
And I'm way past asking permission.

55:16.260 --> 55:18.000
地球刚失去了最好的守卫者
Earth just lost her best defender.

55:18.790 --> 55:19.890
我们是来战斗的
So we're here to fight.

55:21.580 --> 55:23.090
如果你想挡路
And if you wanna stand in our way...

55:24.510 --> 55:25.610
我们连你一起打
we'll fight you too.

55:30.020 --> 55:31.020
逮捕他们
Arrest them.

55:31.840 --> 55:32.790
这就去
All over it.

55:38.490 --> 55:39.810
得上军事法庭了
That's a court-martial.

55:42.450 --> 55:43.650
见到你真高兴  队长
It's great to see you, Cap.

55:44.350 --> 55:45.450
你也是  罗德
You too, Rhodey.

55:50.140 --> 55:50.970
你们
You guys...

55:51.750 --> 55:53.100
看上去状况真差
really look like crap.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.490
这几年很辛苦吧
Must've been a rough couple years.

55:55.610 --> 55:58.470
是啊  没怎么住五星酒店
Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

55:58.790 --> 56:00.810
我觉得你们看上去很棒
I think you look great.

56:08.050 --> 56:09.290
是啊  我回来了
Yeah, I'm back.

56:11.750 --> 56:12.650
你好啊  布鲁斯
Hi, Bruce.

56:18.270 --> 56:19.030
小娜
Nat.

56:22.770 --> 56:24.000
好尴尬
This is awkward.

56:26.650 --> 56:28.560
那他们还会再回来吧
So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

56:28.560 --> 56:29.810
他们显然能找到我们
And they can clearly find us.

56:29.810 --> 56:31.950
我们得全体出动  克林特呢
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

56:32.240 --> 56:33.520
《协议》的事后
After the whole Accords situation,

56:33.520 --> 56:35.270
他和斯科特做了协议
he and Scott took a deal.

56:35.270 --> 56:37.160
他们的家人承受不了  所以他们被软禁在家了
It was too tough on their families. They're on house arrest.

56:37.160 --> 56:38.470
-斯科特是谁  -蚁人
- Who's Scott? - Ant-Man.

56:38.470 --> 56:40.390
有蚁人还有蜘蛛侠
There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
好吧
Okay, look.

56:42.050 --> 56:45.120
灭霸有全宇宙最大的军队
Thanos has the biggest army in the universe...

56:45.120 --> 56:48.730
他不会罢休的  除非他得到
and he is not gonna stop until he gets...

56:50.690 --> 56:51.600
幻视的宝石
Vision's stone.

56:51.600 --> 56:52.970
那我们得保护它
Then we have to protect it.

56:53.030 --> 56:54.800
不  我们得毁掉它
No, we have to destroy it.

56:56.850 --> 56:58.310
我好好想过了
I've been giving a good deal of thought

56:58.310 --> 56:59.510
我脑袋上的这东西
to this entity in my head.

56:59.510 --> 57:01.310
关于它的性质
About its nature.

57:01.440 --> 57:03.770
以及它的组成
But also its composition.

57:03.770 --> 57:05.570
我觉得如果它遭遇
I think if it were exposed

57:05.750 --> 57:08.080
足够强大的能量源
to a sufficiently powerful energy source...

57:08.080 --> 57:11.870
特性类似其本身的能量  那或许
something very similar to its own signature, perhaps...

57:13.230 --> 57:15.670
它的分子完整性就会被破坏
its molecular integrity could fail.

57:16.120 --> 57:18.070
你也会随之被摧毁
Yeah, and you with it.

57:18.790 --> 57:20.370
这不是个选择
We're not having this conversation.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.320
只有销毁宝石
Eliminating the stone is the only way

57:22.320 --> 57:24.510
才能确保灭霸拿不到它
to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

57:25.060 --> 57:27.200
那代价太高了
That's too high a price.

57:31.730 --> 57:34.470
只有你有能力付出这代价
Only you have the power to pay it.

57:38.350 --> 57:40.490
灭霸威胁宇宙一半的生命
Thanos threatens half the universe.

57:40.510 --> 57:43.000
不能让一人的生命阻碍战胜他的希望
One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

57:43.230 --> 57:44.380
这样不对
But it should.

57:47.150 --> 57:48.120
我们不以命换命  幻视
We don't trade lives, Vision.

57:48.120 --> 57:50.960
队长  70年前  你付出生命
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life...

57:50.960 --> 57:52.540
来挽救了多少人
to save how many millions of people?

57:52.540 --> 57:54.640
告诉我  这有什么不同
Tell me, why is this any different?

57:55.010 --> 57:57.490
因为  你可能还有选择
Because you might have a choice.

57:58.590 --> 57:59.860
你的心灵是由
Your mind is made up

57:59.870 --> 58:02.560
许多东西叠加而成的
of a complex construct of overlays.

58:02.560 --> 58:06.250
贾维斯  奥创  托尼  我  宝石
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

58:06.250 --> 58:08.090
他们混在了一起
All of them mixed together,

58:08.090 --> 58:09.980
彼此学习
all of them learning from one another.

58:09.980 --> 58:11.920
你是说幻视并不只是那块宝石
You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

58:11.920 --> 58:14.860
我是说  如果我们取出宝石
I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

58:15.150 --> 58:16.820
还剩下不少的幻视
there's still a whole lot of Vision left.

58:16.820 --> 58:18.410
或许还是最好的部分
Perhaps the best parts.

58:18.490 --> 58:19.580
这能做到吗
Can we do that?

58:20.510 --> 58:21.810
我在这里是不行
Not me, not here.

58:22.610 --> 58:24.100
那你最好赶紧找到
Well, you better find someone

58:24.100 --> 58:25.570
合适的地方和人
and somewhere fast.

58:25.570 --> 58:26.700
罗斯可不会让你们
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys

58:26.700 --> 58:28.310
再回老房间住
have your old rooms back.

58:31.240 --> 58:32.270
我知道个地方
I know somewhere.

58:46.410 --> 58:49.330
瓦  坎  达

58:47.570 --> 58:48.390
御林护卫
The Kingsguard

58:48.390 --> 58:50.480
和女子皇家护卫队都已得到通知
and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

58:50.480 --> 58:51.710
边境部落呢
And the Border Tribe?

58:52.190 --> 58:53.500
还剩的都通知了
Those that are left.

58:54.140 --> 58:56.170
派人传话去贾巴里
Send word to the Jabari as well.

58:56.490 --> 58:58.550
姆巴库也喜欢好好打一场
M'Baku likes a good fight.

59:00.700 --> 59:01.890
他呢
And what of this one?

59:03.060 --> 59:05.240
他可能已经厌倦了战争
This one may be tired of war.

59:05.640 --> 59:08.480
但白狼已经休息够久了
But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

59:31.340 --> 59:32.350
哪里要打仗了
Where's the fight?

59:33.820 --> 59:34.880
他们就来
On its way.

59:53.720 --> 59:56.180
我为灭霸效力这么久
In all the time I've served Thanos...

59:58.120 --> 59:59.630
从未让他失望过
I have never failed him.

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:07.890
如果我赶到了我们泰坦星的汇合点
If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:09.900
而时间宝石还连在
with the Time Stone still attached

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.020
你这讨厌鬼身上
to your vaguely irritating person...

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.810
我会受到  责罚的
there would be judgment.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.570
给我
Give me...

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:30.320
宝石
the stone.

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:45.040
你还真是件忠心耿耿的外套啊
You're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.030
说到忠诚
Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:48.900
什么...
What the...

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.590
-我知道你要说什么  -你不该在这儿的
- I know what you're gonna say. - You should not be here.

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:51.730
-我本想回家的  -我不想听
- I was gonna go home. - I don't wanna hear it.

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:52.770
但下去的路好远啊
But it was such a long way down

01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:53.570
我路上就在想你
and I just thought about you on the way...

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:54.280
你还说上了
And now I gotta hear it.

01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:55.530
然后我就卡在飞船边上了
...and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:58.160
这件战衣的直觉特别准
And this suit is ridiculously intuitive,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:58.660
-真的  -该死
- by the way. - God damn it.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.370
所以如果要说  我在这儿其实怪你
So, if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.450
-你说什么  -我收回
- What did you just say? - I take that back.

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:04.830
现在  我在外太空里了
And now, I'm here in space.

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:07.270
是啊  在我不想要你在的地方
Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.810
这里不是科尼岛  不是学校出游
This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip.

01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:11.090
这可是有去无回
This is a one-way ticket.

01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:13.020
听到了吗  别假装你都想清楚了
You hear me? Don't pretend you thought this through.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:13.810
不  我想清楚了
No, I did think this through.

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.490
你根本不可能想清楚了
You could not have possibly thought this through.

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:17.230
我想当个友好邻居蜘蛛侠
You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:18.630
但没有邻居了还怎么做
if there's no neighborhood.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:21.980
好吧  这话不是很通
Okay, that didn't really make sense,

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:23.350
但你明白我想说什么
but you know what I'm trying to say.

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.890
好了  还有情况要处理呢
Come on. We got a situation.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:30.540
看到下面那个了吗  他有麻烦
See him down there? He's in trouble.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.470
你有什么计划
What's your plan?

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:32.460
说吧
Go.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.600
好吧
Okay, okay...

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:38.110
好吧  你看过一部特老的电影《异形》吗
Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.040
疼吧  是不是
Painful, aren't they?

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:47.760
原本是用来做显微手术的
They were originally designed for microsurgery.

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:50.180
任何一个
And any one of them...

01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:58.330
都能瞬间杀死你的朋友
could end your friend's life in an instant.

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.270
我得告诉你  他算不上是我的朋友
I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend.

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:03.230
救他命更多是职业上的礼貌
Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.190
你什么都没救
You've saved nothing.

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:10.710
你的力量跟我比微不足道
Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:13.310
是啊  但那孩子看的电影多
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:29.720
棒啊  等等  这是什么
Yes! Wait. What are those?

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:46.540
我们还没正式介绍过呢
Hey, we haven't officially met.

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:48.600
好吧
Cool.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.410
我们得调头回去
We gotta turn this ship around.

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:54.500
是啊  他现在想跑了
Yeah, now he wants to run.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.430
-好计划  -我想保护宝石
- Great plan. - No, I want to protect the stone.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.420
我还想要你谢我呢
And I want you to thank me.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.130
说吧  我听着呢
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:02.210
谢什么  差点把我轰进太空里吗
For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.540
刚是谁救了你个魔法师  是我
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.130
真不知道你这么膨胀的脑袋怎么塞得进头盔里
I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:09.420
承认吧  你早该听我的躲起来
Admit it, you should've ducked out when I told you to.

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.200
我让你别插手的  你不肯
I tried to bench you. You refused.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.190
不像你人生中的其他所有人  我不为你工作
Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.750
因为这个
And due to that fact,

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.330
我们现在在一艘飞行甜甜圈上
we're now in a flying doughnut...

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.230
离地球十万八千里  还没有后援
billions of miles from Earth with no backup.

01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:20.230
-我是后援  -不  你是偷渡的
- I'm backup. - No, you're a stowaway.

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:21.370
大人说话呢
The adults are talking.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.180
抱歉  我搞不懂你们什么关系
I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.010
他是你的养子吗
What is he, your ward?

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.000
不是
No.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.480
-我是彼得  -斯特兰奇博士[奇异博士]
- I'm Peter, by the way. - Doctor Strange.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.040
你在用诨号吗
You're using our made-up names.

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.550
那我是蜘蛛侠
I'm Spider-Man, then.

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.190
这艘船在自我纠正航线
This ship is self-correcting its course.

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:37.190
它在自动驾驶
Thing's on autopilot.

01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:38.320
我们能控制它吗
Can we control it?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
飞回家
Fly us home?

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.910
-斯塔克  -嗯
- Stark? - Yeah.

01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:46.240
你能带我们回家吗
Can you get us home?

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:47.510
我听到了
Yeah, I heard you.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:51.010
我在想  或许我们不该回去
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.600
我们决不能
Under no circumstances

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.150
把时间宝石送去灭霸那里
can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.850
你恐怕还不明白
I don't think you quite understand

01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:59.130
-事情的严重性吧  -什么  不
- what's at stake here. - What? No.

01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:01.410
是你不明白
It's you who doesn't understand...

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:04.270
灭霸萦绕我的脑海六年了
that Thanos has been inside my head for six years.

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:05.800
自从他派了支军队去纽约
Since he sent an army to New York

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.970
现在他又回来了
and now he's back.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.040
我不知道该怎么办
And I don't know what to do.

01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:10.930
所以我不能确定
So I'm not so sure

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.880
是该在我们的地盘还是他的地盘跟他打
if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.130
但你看到了他们做的事  看到了他们能做什么
but you saw what they did, what they can do.

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:18.840
至少去他的地盘  还能出其不意
At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.350
我说  我们打上门去
So I say we take the fight to him.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:22.980
博士
Doctor.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.790
你同意吗
Do you concur?

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.610
好吧  斯塔克  我们去找他
All right, Stark. We go to him.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.060
但你要明白
But you have to understand...

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.420
如果我要选择救你
if it comes to saving you

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.870
那孩子  或是时间宝石
or the kid or the Time Stone...

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.050
我会毫不犹豫地任你们死去
I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.630
我必须如此  因为这事关宇宙的命运
I can't, because the universe depends on it.

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:50.050
好  好三观
Nice. Good, moral compass.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:51.980
我们没问题了
We're straight.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:54.440
好吧  小子
All right, kid.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:57.910
你是复仇者了
You're an Avenger now.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.970
我觉得你可能饿了
I thought you might be hungry.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.660
我一直讨厌那椅子
I always hated that chair.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.160
我听说了
So I've been told.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.900
即便如此  我还是希望有天你能坐上去
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:59.340
我讨厌这个房间
I hated this room.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:01.260
这艘飞船
This ship.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.260
我讨厌我曾经的生活
I hated my life.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.400
这你也跟我说过
You told me that too.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.450
每天都说
Every day.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.550
说了将近20年
For almost 20 years.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.260
你带走我时  我还是孩子
I was a child when you took me.

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:26.600
我救了你
I saved you.

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:30.880
不
No.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.130
不  我们在母星上时  本来很幸福
No. We were happy on my home planet.

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:37.710
饿着肚子睡觉
Going to bed hungry...

01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:40.050
到处找残羹冷炙
scrounging for scraps.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.800
你的星球当时已濒临崩溃
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.660
是我阻止了那发生
I'm the one who stopped that.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.340
你知道它后来怎么样了吗
Do you know what's happened since then?

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.030
新生的孩子
The children born...

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:53.410
都能吃饱肚子  看到清澈的天空
have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.150
那里成了天堂
It's a paradise.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:59.200
因为你杀了半个星球的人
Because you murdered half the planet.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.240
为了救赎  这只是小小代价
A small price to pay for salvation.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.380
你疯了
You're insane.

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:05.580
小家伙  这只是简单的数学
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.870
宇宙是有限的  资源也是有限的
This universe is finite, its resources finite.

01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:12.940
如果生命不加以控制  就会消亡
If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.260
它需要纠正
It needs correction.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.400
这你怎么知道
You don't know that!

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.050
只有我知道这个道理
I'm the only one who knows that.

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:24.390
至少  只有我愿意为此采取行动
At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:27.250
曾经
For a time...

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:34.050
你也有那样的意愿
you had that same will...

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:38.000
与我一同战斗
as you fought by my side.

01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:39.640
女儿
Daughter.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.140
我不是你的女儿
I'm not your daughter.

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:47.550
我恨自己的一切都是你教的
Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:49.820
而你因此
And, in doing so,

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:52.370
也成了银河系里最威猛的女人
made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:57.900
所以我派你去寻找灵魂宝石
That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.590
抱歉我让你失望了
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:06.850
我是失望
I am disappointed.

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:09.970
但不是因为你没找到
But not because you didn't find it.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.770
是因为你找到了
But because you did.

01:08:17.190 --> 01:08:18.540
但你却撒谎了
And you lied.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.240
星云
Nebula.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.390
别这样
Don't do this.

01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.940
一段时间之前
Some time ago,

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:49.970
你妹妹溜上船来杀我
your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:51.270
求你别这样
Please don't do this.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.410
还差点成功了
And very nearly succeeded.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.670
所以我把她带来了这里
So I brought her here.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.390
好跟她谈谈
To talk.

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.350
住手  住手
Stop. Stop it.

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:16.680
我以生命起誓
I swear to you on my life.

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.290
我没找到灵魂宝石
I never found the Soul Stone.

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:25.310
读取记忆文件
Accessing memory files.

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.770
你知道他要做什么
You know what he's about to do.

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.540
他总算准备好了  他要去找宝石
He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:30.910
-所有宝石  -他不可能得到所有宝石
- All of them. - He can never get them all.

01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:31.760
他会的
He will!

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.660
他不能  星云
He can't, Nebula.

01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:36.350
因为我找到了灵魂宝石的地图
Because I found the map to the Soul Stone...

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.420
然后把它烧成了灰  我把它烧了
and I burned it to ash. I burned it.

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.140
你很强壮
You're strong.

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.280
这是我教的
Me.

01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:53.310
你很慷慨
You're generous.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:55.810
这是我教的
Me.

01:09:57.810 --> 01:09:59.950
但我可没教过你撒谎
But I never taught you to lie.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.680
所以你很不擅长
That's why you're so bad at it.

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:09.810
灵魂宝石在哪
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:28.370
沃密尔星球
Vormir!

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:47.860
宝石在沃密尔
The stone is on Vormir.

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.370
带我去
Show me.

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:56.780
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:57.950
在杯子里尿
Tinkle in the cup.

01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:59.480
我们不看  有什么可看的
We're not looking. What's there to see?

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.810
小树枝是什么  谁都见过小树枝
What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig before.

01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:02.690
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:03.990
树人  把杯子里的东西
Tree, pour what's in the cup

01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:06.120
倒进太空里  然后再用杯子
out into space and go in the cup again.

01:11:06.130 --> 01:11:07.250
你会格鲁特语
You speak Groot?

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:09.430
阿斯加德教这个  选修课
Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:10.610
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.520
等我们快到了你会知道的
You'll know when we're close.

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:14.160
尼德威阿尔的锻炉汲取
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:16.630
一颗中子星的炙热能量
the blazing power of a neutron star.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.380
我的锤子就是在那里铸造的
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:23.510
可赞了
It's truly awesome.

01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:32.940
好吧  该拿出船长的样子了
Okay, time to be the captain.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.740
弟弟死了啊
So, dead brother, huh?

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:41.850
嗯  那是挺烦人的
Yeah, that could be annoying.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.180
他以前也死过
Well, he's been dead before.

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.630
但这次可能是真的了
But, no, this time I think it really might be true.

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:51.510
你说你还有姐姐和爸爸
And you said your sister and your dad?

01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:52.510
都死了
Both dead.

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.130
还有妈妈吧
But still got a mom, though?

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.090
被黑暗精灵杀了
Killed by a dark elf.

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.250
最好朋友呢
A best friend?

01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:59.680
利刃穿心而死
Stabbed through the heart.

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:05.920
你真想执行这趟杀人任务吗
You sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:09.460
非常想
Absolutely.

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:13.750
愤怒  复仇  怒火  失去  后悔
Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.060
都是很好的动力
they're all tremendous motivators.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.550
让人脑袋很清醒
They really clear the mind.

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:18.170
我没问题的
So I'm good to go.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:21.530
是啊  但这个灭霸
Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about...

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:23.740
他可是最厉害的
he's the toughest there is.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.960
-他是没打过我  -他打过的
- Well, he's never fought me. - Yeah, he has.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.480
他没打过我两次
He's never fought me twice.

01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:30.310
别忘了  我还要去铸把新锤子
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:32.130
这锤子最好厉害
It better be some hammer.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.920
我1500岁了
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:41.890
我杀过的敌人是我岁数的一倍
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.860
他们每个人都想杀死我
And every one of them would've rather killed me,

01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:45.350
但没人成功过
but none succeeded.

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:48.340
我还活着是因为命运希望我活着
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:51.660
灭霸只是又一个这样的混蛋
Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards...

01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:53.450
而他会是又一个我复仇的对象
and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.

01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:55.340
这是命运的意愿
Fate wills it so.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.370
如果你错了呢
And what if you're wrong?

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:03.530
如果我错了
If I'm wrong, then...

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.570
那我还有什么可失去的呢
what more could I lose?

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:21.680
我可以失去很多
I could lose a lot.

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:23.630
我个人而言可以失去很多呢
Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.800
好吧
Okay.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.110
如果命运真希望你杀了那混球
If fate does want you to kill that crapsack...

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.140
你会需要不止一颗眼球
you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.020
-这是什么  -你说呢
- What's this? - What's it look like?

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:41.150
康特西亚星球上一个混蛋打赌输给我的
Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.340
他把眼睛给你了
He gave you his eye?

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:43.710
不  他给了我100信用点
No, he gave me 100 credits.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.520
我那晚稍后溜进了他房里偷走了他的眼睛
I snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye.

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:50.260
谢谢  好兔子
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.600
你该洗洗的
I would've washed that.

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:03.690
我唯一能把它从康特西亚偷出来的办法就是塞进我
The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.290
我们到了
Hey, we're here!

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.030
这玩意好像不好使
I don't think this thing works.

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:12.410
怎么暗乎乎的
Everything seems dark.

01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:16.090
不是眼睛的问题
It ain't the eye.

01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:30.930
情况不对
Something's wrong.

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.460
中子星熄灭了
The star's gone out.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.160
环也冻住了
And the rings are frozen.

01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:45.570
尼  德  威  阿  尔

01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:58.080
希望这些矮人
I hope these dwarves

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.430
铸造的本事比打扫强
are better at forging than they are cleaning.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:06.470
或许他们是意识到
Maybe they realized that

01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:08.890
自己住在太空里的一个垃圾堆里
they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.630
这个锻炉几世纪都没熄过火了
This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.000
你说灭霸有个手套  是吧
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.270
对  怎么
Yes, why?

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:20.100
像那样的吗
It look anything like that?

01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:25.410
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:26.780
回飞行舱去
Go back to the pod.

01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:32.640
伊特里  等等
Eitri, wait!

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:34.000
住手
Stop!

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:36.000
住手
Stop.

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:37.990
托尔
Thor?

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:42.490
这里发生了什么
What happened here?

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:45.470
你本该保护我们的
You were supposed to protect us.

01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:48.980
阿斯加德本该保护我们的
Asgard was supposed to protect us.

01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:51.370
阿斯加德被毁了
Asgard is destroyed.

01:15:53.490 --> 01:15:56.970
伊特里  手套  你做了什么
Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.820
环上住了300个矮人
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.430
我以为如果我听从他的命令  他们就会安全
I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.520
我造出了他要的东西
I made what he wanted.

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:27.390
一件能汲取宝石力量的装置
A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:33.950
然后他还是杀了所有人
Then he killed everyone anyway.

01:16:36.610 --> 01:16:38.120
除了我
All except me.

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.560
"你的命属于你"  他说
"Your life is yours," He said.

01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:46.670
"但你的手  属于我"
"But your hands are mine alone."

01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:49.660
伊特里  你的手不是重点
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.300
你设计的每一件武器
Every weapon you've ever designed,

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.860
每把斧子  锤子  剑
every axe, hammer, sword...

01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:56.030
都在你脑袋里
it's all inside your head.

01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:58.960
我知道你现在觉得希望尽失
Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.130
相信我  我知道
Trust me, I know.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:05.720
但你我联手  我们能杀了灭霸
But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:48.500
螳螂  听好了
Mantis, listen very carefully.

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.710
我需要你去泰坦星见我
I need you to meet me on Titan.

01:17:57.730 --> 01:17:58.380
怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

01:17:58.390 --> 01:18:00.280
我们好像到了
I think we're here.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.550
这玩意恐怕没有自动停车功能
I don't think this rig has a self-park function.

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.180
把手伸到方向装置里
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.350
把这个合上
Close those around it.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.470
-懂吗  -好的
- You understand? - Yep, got it.

01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:10.850
这是给一个大块头准备的
This was meant for one big guy,

01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:13.330
-我们动作得同步  -好的  好了
- so we gotta move at the same time. - Okay, okay. Ready.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.740
我们最好转向
We might wanna turn.

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:20.410
转向  转向啊
Turn! Turn! Turn!

01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:47.770
泰  坦  星

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:50.540
你没事吧
You all right?

01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:54.000
好悬啊
That was close.

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.490
我欠你的
I owe you one.

01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.150
我想说  如果外星人
Let me just say, if aliens

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.530
在我胸腔里植入了卵什么的
wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:02.550
而我吃掉了你们谁  那我很抱歉
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:05.210
余下的时间里不许你
I do not want another single pop culture reference

01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:06.570
再提流行文化梗了  懂吗
out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:08.450
我是想说  有东西过来了
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:17.120
灭霸
Thanos!

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.520
拜托别把你的卵放进我身体里
Please don't put your eggs in me!

01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:42.920
别动  小丑
Stay down, clown.

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.230
死吧  死亡毯子
Die, blanket of death!

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:00.050
都别动  都给我冷静
Everybody stay where you are. Chill the eff out.

01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:02.730
我就问你一次
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.780
卡魔拉呢
Where is Gamora?

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.600
我问你个更好的  卡魔拉是谁
Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:10.670
我问你个更好的  为什么卡魔拉
I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:12.600
告诉我她在哪  否则我发誓
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.950
我会把这小怪物烧焦的
I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:17.090
来吧  你打我的人  我打你的人  来吧
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and I'll blast him. Let's go!

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:20.270
动手吧  奎尔  我承受得住
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:21.340
不  他承受不住
No, he can't take it!

01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.270
她说得对  你承受不住
She's right. You can't.

01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:24.630
是吗  你不告诉我她在哪吗  好啊
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine.

01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:25.820
我杀了你们三个
I'll kill all three of you

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.990
然后揍到灭霸开口
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.900
从你开始
Starting with you.

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:30.010
等等  灭霸
Wait, what, Thanos?

01:20:30.010 --> 01:20:32.350
好吧  我问你个问题
All right, let me ask you this one time.

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:34.680
你效忠哪位主人
What master do you serve?

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.750
我效忠哪位主人
What master do I serve?

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:37.680
怎么  我该说"耶稣"吗
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.450
你是地球人
You're from Earth.

01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:40.390
我不是地球人  我是密苏里人
I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:41.900
那就是地球  白痴
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:42.850
你打我们干什么
What are you hassling us for?

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.760
你们不是灭霸的人
So you're not with Thanos?

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:47.280
灭霸的人
With Thanos?

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.480
不  我是来杀灭霸的
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.550
他带走了我女人  等等  你们是谁
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:54.870
我们是复仇者  哥们
We're the Avengers, man.

01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:57.470
你们是托尔说的人
You're the ones Thor told us about.

01:20:57.610 --> 01:20:58.670
你们认识托尔
You know Thor?

01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:59.620
是啊
Yeah.

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:02.840
高个  长得不咋样  还需要别人救
Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:03.880
他现在在哪
Where is he now?

01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:21.300
这就是你的计划  用砖头拍他
This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.580
这是模具
It's a mold.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.880
国王的武器
A king's weapon.

01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:27.590
本该是阿斯加德最强大的
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:31.370
理论上  它甚至能召唤彩虹桥
In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:32.560
它有名字吗
Did it have a name?

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:35.380
风暴斧
Stormbreaker.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:37.070
有点过了
That's a bit much.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.150
要怎么打造它
So how do we make it?

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.830
你得重启锻炉
You'll have to restart the forge.

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:47.330
唤醒濒死星球的核心
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:52.400
兔子  启动飞行舱
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.010
这星球遭遇了什么
The hell happened to this planet?

01:21:58.270 --> 01:22:00.030
偏离自转轴八度
It's eight degrees off its axis.

01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:02.570
引力到处都是
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:06.440
我们有一个优势  他会自己来
Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us.

01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:08.460
我们要利用这一点
We'll use it.

01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:10.270
好了  我有个计划
All right, I have a plan.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.660
至少有个大致轮廓
Or at least the beginnings of one.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.970
非常简单  我们引他过来
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:14.410
把他打趴下  拿到需要的东西
pin him down, get what we need.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:15.820
我可不想陪他跳舞[跟他纠缠]
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.

01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:17.520
我们只想拿手套
We just want the gauntlet.

01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:19.170
你打哈欠
Are you yawning?

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.260
我讲解计划的时候你竟然打哈欠
In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down?

01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:23.890
你听见我说的了吗
Did you hear what I said?

01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:26.730
你说"我们需要计划"之后我就没在听了
I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:28.240
好吧  他沉浸在自己的世界里
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.700
他们习惯了随机应变
See, "Not winging it" isn't really what they do.

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:32.790
那他们习惯怎么做
Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:34.480
打仇恨  拉群架
Kick names, take ass.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.580
没错
Yeah, that's right.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.100
好了  请各位都过来
All right, just get over here, please.

01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:46.290
爵先生  能不能让你的伙伴们围过来
Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:48.380
别爵先生  叫我星爵就好
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.470
我们得联合起来
We gotta coalesce.

01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:54.430
因为如果我们只凭一腔勇气去面对他
'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...

01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:56.940
哥们  别说什么一腔勇气
Dude, don't call us plucky.

01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:58.430
我们不知道那是什么意思
We don't know what it means.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.180
我们很乐观  我喜欢你的计划
All right, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan.

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.840
只不过它烂透了  让我来做计划
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:05.850
这样就完美无缺了
and that way it might be really good.

01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:07.990
告诉他你斗舞拯救宇宙的事
Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:10.110
-什么斗舞  -不值一提
- What dance-off? - It's nothing.

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:11.370
就像那部电影《浑身是劲》一样
Like in Footloose, the movie?

01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:12.800
就是《浑身是劲》那样
Exactly like Footloose.

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:15.240
它依然是史上最棒的电影吗
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.300
从来都不是
It never was.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.570
别打岔  好不好
Don't encourage this, all right?

01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:18.720
-好  -这位飞侠哥顿
- Okay. - We're getting no help

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.420
-帮不上我们什么  -《飞侠哥顿》
- from Flash Gordon here. - Flash Gordon?

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:22.400
那可是在夸我哦
By the way, that's a compliment.

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.980
别忘了  我有一半人类血统
Don't forget, I'm half human.

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.930
也就是说我有一半的蠢
So that 50% of me that's stupid...

01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:27.940
而你是百分百的蠢
that's 100% you.

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.460
我真佩服你数学这么好
Your math is blowing my mind.

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:30.500
打扰一下
Excuse me.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.130
你的朋友经常那样吗
But does your friend often do that?

01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:38.480
斯特兰奇  没事吧
Strange, we all right?

01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:50.070
你恢复了  你没事
You're back. You're all right.

01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:52.210
你刚刚怎么了
Hey, what was that?

01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:56.440
我推进了时间  浏览未来的可能性
I went forward in time to view alternate futures.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:59.780
去看即将到来的这一战所有可能出现的结果
To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.

01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:02.430
你看到了多少种
How many did you see?

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.190
一千四百万六百零五种
14,000,605.

01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:07.670
我们赢了几种
How many did we win?

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.550
一种
One.

01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:30.700
沃  密  尔  星  球

01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:37.940
灵魂宝石最好在山上
The stone had better be up there.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.370
不然你妹妹就完了
For your sister's sake.

01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:08.410
欢迎  灭霸  阿拉尔斯之子
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:13.870
卡魔拉  灭霸之女
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.030
你认识我们
You know us?

01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:19.380
我被诅咒认识所有来到此地的人
It is my curse to know all who journey here.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.990
灵魂宝石在哪
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.910
你应该知道
You should know...

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.800
得到它的代价极大
it extracts a terrible price.

01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:30.870
我准备好了
I am prepared.

01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:35.710
我们一开始都这么以为
We all think that at first.

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.370
但我们都错了
We are all wrong.

01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:56.480
你怎么如此熟悉这里
How is it you know this place so well?

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.080
上一世我也想找无限宝石
A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:04.040
甚至曾把一个攥在手里过
I even held one in my hand.

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:08.310
但它把我流放到这里
But it cast me out, banished me here.

01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:12.780
指引别人寻找我无法拥有的珍宝
Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.490
你所寻找的就在你面前
What you seek lies in front of you.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.010
你所害怕的也在那里
As does what you fear.

01:26:28.410 --> 01:26:29.340
这是什么
What's this?

01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:31.000
代价
The price.

01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:36.460
无限宝石中  灵魂宝石很特别
Soul holds a special place among the Infinity Stones.

01:26:37.630 --> 01:26:41.610
可以说它有一定的智慧
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.940
告诉我它需要什么
Tell me what it needs.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.520
为了确保拥有它的人
To ensure that whoever possesses it...

01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:50.610
理解它的力量
understands its power...

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:55.830
灵魂宝石需要献祭
the stone demands a sacrifice.

01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:57.120
献祭什么
Of what?

01:26:58.150 --> 01:27:00.010
要得到灵魂宝石
In order to take the stone,

01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:02.510
你必须失去自己的珍爱之物
you must lose that which you love.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.320
以一个灵魂
A soul...

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.590
换取一个灵魂
for a soul.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.330
我这一生  都梦想有一天
All my life, I dreamed of a day...

01:27:27.930 --> 01:27:29.210
有一瞬
a moment...

01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:32.500
能让你得到应有的报应
when you got what you deserved.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.770
而我总是会失望
And I was always so disappointed.

01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:41.570
但现在
But now...

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.320
你杀戮  折磨
You kill and torture...

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.790
还说这是仁慈
and you call it mercy.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.050
宇宙已对你作出了评判
The universe has judged you.

01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:05.320
你想得到奖赏  而它拒绝了你
You asked it for a prize, and it told you no.

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:08.160
你失败了
You failed.

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.410
知道为什么吗
And do you wanna know why?

01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:14.410
因为你没有爱过
Because you love nothing.

01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:16.220
你谁也不爱
No one.

01:28:22.410 --> 01:28:23.590
不
No.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.020
不是吧
Really?

01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:31.370
还流泪
Tears?

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:33.690
他不是为自己流泪
They're not for him.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.140
不
No.

01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:52.430
这不是爱
This isn't love.

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.300
我曾忽视过自己的命运
I ignored my destiny once.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.220
我不能再重蹈覆辙
I cannot do that again.

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:04.060
就算是为你也不行
Even for you.

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.750
对不起了  小家伙
I'm sorry, little one.

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:35.870
不
No!

01:31:13.150 --> 01:31:16.040
高度降至2600  030方向
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:17.990
希望你是对的
I hope you're right about this.

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:20.630
否则我们降落的速度会比你希望的快得多
Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:38.570
你说我们要让瓦坎达
When you said we were going to open Wakanda

01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:39.620
对世界开放
to the rest of the world...

01:31:39.630 --> 01:31:41.670
我没想到是这样
this is not what I imagined.

01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:43.530
那你以为是什么样
And what did you imagine?

01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:45.000
奥运会
The Olympics.

01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:46.650
或许开家星巴克
Maybe even a Starbucks.

01:32:01.330 --> 01:32:02.340
我们要鞠躬吗
Should we bow?

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.930
要  他是国王
Yeah, he's a king.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.740
我好像总要为什么谢你
Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.

01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:09.460
你在干嘛呢
What are you doing?

01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:12.130
我们这儿没这习俗
Uh, we don't do that here.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.430
我们会遭到多猛烈的袭击
So how big of an assault should we expect?

01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:17.580
先生  我认为你应该准备应对非常猛烈的袭击
Sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault.

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:18.500
我们情况如何
How we looking?

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.200
我的御林护卫会参战
You will have my Kingsguard,

01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:23.930
还有边境部落  女子皇家护卫队  还有...
the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.910
一个还算稳定的百岁老人
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:31.690
你怎么样了  巴克
How you been, Buck?

01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:34.370
还行吧  毕竟都快世界末日了
Not bad, for the end of the world.

01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:50.240
多态结构的
The structure is polymorphic.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.020
对  神经元是非序列排列的
Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:54.980
为什么不直接
Why didn't you just

01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:58.090
重新编码突触  让它们协调工作
reprogram the synapses to work collectively?

01:32:59.290 --> 01:33:02.290
因为我们没想到
Because we didn't think of it.

01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:04.240
你相信你尽力了
I'm sure you did your best.

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.260
你能做到吗
Can you do it?

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.630
可以  但这里有超过两万亿神经元
Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.020
一点小误差就可能导致大规模的回路故障
One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.

01:33:13.410 --> 01:33:14.790
会需要点时间  哥哥
It will take time, brother.

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:17.050
多长时间
How long?

01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:18.580
越长越好
As long as you can give me.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.890
有东西进入了大气层
Something's entered the atmosphere.

01:33:42.210 --> 01:33:44.170
队长  我们有麻烦了
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.990
天哪  我爱这个地方
God, I love this place.

01:33:56.010 --> 01:33:57.510
别高兴太早  各位
Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.

01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:59.790
穹顶外有更多入侵者过来了
We got more incoming outside the dome.

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:20.070
来不及了
It's too late.

01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:22.740
我们现在就得把宝石毁掉
We need to destroy the stone now.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.370
幻视  你给我躺回去
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

01:34:24.630 --> 01:34:25.860
我们会拖住它们
We will hold them off.

01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:29.250
旺达  这石头一旦从他头部取出
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out of his head...

01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:30.870
你就把它毁掉
you blow it to hell.

01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:31.890
我会的
I will.

01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:35.510
全城疏散  启动全面防御
Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:37.820
给这人弄块盾牌
And get this man a shield.

01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:50.110
我认为你没太搞懂这里的状况
I don't think you get the scientifics here.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.940
这些环很巨大  你想移动它们
These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving...

01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:55.380
会需要大得多的东西才能把它们带动起来
you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.

01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:57.600
-交给我  -交给你
- Leave that to me. - Leave it to you?

01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.340
伙计  你在太空里
Buddy, you're in space.

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.390
你就拿了一根绳和一个...
All you got is a rope and a...

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.950
发动引擎
Fire the engines!

01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:30.570
再加把力  兔子
More power, rabbit!

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.850
干得漂亮  小子
Well done, boy.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.450
那就是尼德威阿尔
That's Nidavellir.

01:36:27.730 --> 01:36:28.680
该死
Damn it.

01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:30.610
"该死"  "该死"是什么意思
"Damn it"? What's "Damn it"?

01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:32.150
机械装置坏了
The mechanism is crippled.

01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:33.760
-什么  -光圈不打开
- What? - With the iris closed,

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:34.940
我就没法加热金属
I can't heat the metal.

01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.560
加热需要多久
How long will it take to heat it?

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.740
几分钟  或许更久  怎么了
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:42.220
我去把它撑开
I'm gonna hold it open.

01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:43.520
那是自杀
That's suicide.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:46.110
不拿风暴斧就去找灭霸也是自杀
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:56.790
情况如何  布鲁斯
How we looking, Bruce?

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.900
我觉得我已经找到诀窍了
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:03.990
感觉太棒了
This is amazing, man.

01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:06.410
就像不用变身就成了绿巨人
It's like being the Hulk without actually...

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.700
我没事  我没事
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:14.460
有两处热信号
I've got two heat signatures

01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:15.820
要冲破林线了
breaking through the tree line.

01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.200
谢谢你和我们并肩作战
Thank you for standing with us.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.750
你那个朋友呢
Where's your other friend?

01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:12.950
他的命你要用命偿
You will pay for his life with yours.

01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:15.860
灭霸会拿到那块宝石的
Thanos will have that stone.

01:38:17.050 --> 01:38:18.240
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.410
你是在瓦坎达
You are in Wakanda now.

01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:24.670
灭霸除了灰烬和鲜血什么也别想得到
Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:26.560
我们...
We

01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:29.610
不吝鲜血
have blood to spare.

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:42.200
他们要投降吗
They surrender?

01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:44.470
并没有
Not exactly.

01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:12.830
搞什么
What the hell?

01:39:15.710 --> 01:39:17.380
看来惹毛她了
Looks like we pissed her off.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.820
他们在自杀
They're killing themselves.

01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:07.730
看到他们的牙了吗
You see the teeth on those things?

01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:08.460
好了  你退后  山姆
All right, back up, Sam.

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:10.090
别烧了你的翅膀
You're gonna get your wings singed.

01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:23.980
队长  如果他们绕过防线
Cap, if these things circle the perimeter

01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:24.900
从我们后面进来
and get in behind us...

01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:26.840
就没人挡在他们和幻视之间了
there's nothing between them and Vision.

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:28.970
那我们最好确保他们都在我们眼前
Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:30.160
怎么做
How do we do that?

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.040
打开屏障
We open the barrier.

01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:40.880
听我口令  打开西北部17区屏障
On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:43.010
请求确认  陛下
Requesting confirmation, My King.

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.820
你是说要打开屏障吗
You said open the barrier?

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.230
听我口令
On my signal.

01:40:46.410 --> 01:40:48.270
这将是瓦坎达的末日
This will be the end of Wakanda.

01:40:49.630 --> 01:40:53.240
那也是史上最壮烈的末日
Then it will be the noblest ending in history.

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:07.490
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever!

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.120
打开
Now!

01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:52.790
还需要多久  苏睿
How much longer, Shuri?

01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:54.290
我都还没开始  哥哥
I've barely begun, brother.

01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:56.140
你最好快点
You might want to pick up the pace.

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.410
众神之父  赐我力量
Allfathers, give me strength.

01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:07.020
你清楚吗  小子
You understand, boy?

01:42:07.450 --> 01:42:10.280
你这是要承受一颗恒星的所有能量
You're about to take the full force of a star.

01:42:11.410 --> 01:42:12.550
你会没命的
It'll kill you.

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:14.810
除非我死了
Only if I die.

01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.870
是
Yes.

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:20.470
没命就是这个意思
That's what killing you means.

01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:50.290
撑住  撑住  托尔
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.830
托尔  说话  拜托
Thor! Say something. Come on.

01:43:43.570 --> 01:43:44.740
托尔  你没事吧
Thor, you okay?

01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:51.650
我觉得他要死了
I think he's dying.

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:53.430
他需要风暴斧
He needs the axe!

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.640
斧柄呢
Where's the handle?

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:02.140
树人  快帮我找斧柄
Tree, help me find the handle!

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:12.120
太多了
There's too many of 'em!

01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:42.800
这下你们倒霉了
You guys are so screwed now!

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:48.220
给我叫灭霸出来
Bring me Thanos!

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:27.390
你更像灭霸
You're much more of a Thanos.

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.790
看来乌木喉已经死了
I take it the Maw is dead.

01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:36.320
今天损失惨重
This day extracts a heavy toll.

01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:40.450
不过  他也算完成了任务
Still, he accomplished his mission.

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:42.460
对你恐怕不是好事
You may regret that.

01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:44.410
他带你来
He brought you face-to-face

01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:46.410
正面迎战魔法师了
with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.080
那你觉得他把你带来了哪里
And where do you think he brought you?

01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:55.710
我猜猜  你家吗
Let me guess. Your home?

01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:01.110
曾经是
It was.

01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:05.640
而且曾经美丽
And it was beautiful.

01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:10.280
泰坦曾经如同很多行星
Titan was like most planets.

01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:13.560
要吃饭的嘴多  能吃的却远远不够
Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

01:47:13.730 --> 01:47:16.780
当我们面临灭绝  我提出了解决方案
And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

01:47:18.090 --> 01:47:19.140
屠杀
Genocide.

01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:24.080
但是随机  公正  不分贫富
But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike.

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.990
他们说我疯了
They called me a madman.

01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:30.400
我的预言最终成真了
And what I predicted came to pass.

01:47:33.190 --> 01:47:35.720
恭喜  你是预言家
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:37.030
我是幸存者
I'm a survivor.

01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:39.280
想谋杀数十亿生命的幸存者
Who wants to murder trillions.

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:43.240
集齐六颗宝石  只要我一个响指
With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.550
他们就将灰飞烟灭  我认为这是慈悲
They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.

01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:51.600
然后呢
And then what?

01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.030
然后是久违的休息
I'd finally rest...

01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:58.760
在全宇宙的感激中坐看日出
and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:03.380
最难的抉择需要最强的意志
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:09.030
你会发现我们的意志不比你弱
I think you'll find our will equal to yours.

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:11.330
我们
Our?

01:48:17.690 --> 01:48:19.060
小菜一碟  奎尔
Piece of cake, Quill.

01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:21.630
没错  如果你的目标是激怒他  你做到了
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

他在哀悼

卡魔拉
Gamora.

01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:33.420

奎尔  你得冷静下来  明白吗
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?

01:51:46.150 --> 01:51:49.440
别跟他打  我们快拔下来了

告诉我她在撒谎
Tell me she's lying.

01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:57.480

她不是一个人
She's not alone.

我们不以命换命  队长
We don't trade lives, Captain.

我们刚刚输了吗

02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:50.440
你为什么要那么做

02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:55.930
这是终局了
We're in the endgame now.

02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:23.390
你没事吧
Are you okay?

你可以的
You can.

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:14.010
如果他拿到宝石  半个宇宙都会死
If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:17.090
这不公平
It's not fair.

02:06:18.850 --> 02:06:20.530
不该是你来的  但就是
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:23.320

一切
Everything.

02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:24.290

起来  将军  起来
Up, General. Up!

02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:32.110
我们不能死在这里
This is no place to die.

02:13:47.010 --> 02:13:48.740
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:53.760

这是唯一的办法
There was no other way.

02:15:09.050 --> 02:15:09.890

我感觉不太好
I don't feel so good.

02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:18.340
