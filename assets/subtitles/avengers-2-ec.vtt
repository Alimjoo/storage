他没事  就是渴了
He's fine. He's thirsty.

16:30.010 --> 16:32.450
好了  醒醒贾维斯  游戏时间到
All right. Look alive, Jarvis. It's playtime.

16:33.380 --> 16:35.050
这玩具只能玩几天
We've only got a couple of days with this joystick,

16:35.050 --> 16:36.770
一定得好好利用
so let's make the most of it.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.290
显示最新结构组成分析
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

16:41.930 --> 16:43.360
权杖来自外星
The scepter is alien.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.150
有些元素我无法确定
There are elements I can't quantify.

16:46.150 --> 16:47.720
就是说还有能确定的元素
So there's elements you can?

16:47.720 --> 16:49.830
宝石似乎是个保护罩
The jewel appears to be a protective housing

16:49.840 --> 16:51.590
保护里面的东西
for something inside,

16:51.720 --> 16:53.160
它力量强大
something powerful.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.030
类似反应堆吗
Like a reactor?

16:54.030 --> 16:55.440
类似电脑
Like a computer.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.000
我破译的应该是代码
I believe I'm deciphering code.

17:00.370 --> 17:01.880
你确定他不会有事吗
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

17:02.960 --> 17:05.240
大家就是靠假装需要他才团结起来的
Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.

17:05.240 --> 17:08.000
没有恶化的可能
There's no possibility of deterioration.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.060
分子桥的作用是瞬时的
The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.150
他的细胞不会发现是在和拟生体结合
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacra.

17:13.150 --> 17:15.240
她是在人造生物组织
She's creating tissue.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.990
如果直接去我的实验室
If you brought him to my lab,

17:16.990 --> 17:19.470
在再生摇篮里二十分钟就能完成
the Regeneration Cradle could do this in 20 minutes.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.590
他要死了  宣布吧  死亡时间是
He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

17:21.590 --> 17:24.210
不不不  我要永生了
No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.

17:24.860 --> 17:27.220
-我是塑料做的了  -给你的饮料
- I'm gonna be made of plastic. - Here's your beverage.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.040
你还是自己的细胞做的  巴顿先生
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.980
你的女朋友也不会看出区别
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

17:30.990 --> 17:32.390
我没有女朋友
I don't have a girlfriend.

17:32.390 --> 17:34.130
那我就没办法了
That I can't fix.

17:34.190 --> 17:36.280
这就是未来  托尼
This is the next thing, Tony.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.760
你那笨重的金属盔甲要被淘汰了
Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.850
要的就是这个效果
That is exactly the plan.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.830
周六的派对你会去吧  海伦
And, Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.550
不像你  我没有多少时间参加派对
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

17:48.030 --> 17:50.230
托尔去吗
Will Thor be there?

17:51.950 --> 17:52.790
怎么了
What's the rumpus?

17:52.790 --> 17:55.120
关于权杖的事
Well, the scepter.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.880
我们之前在疑惑
You see, we were wondering

17:56.890 --> 17:58.800
为什么斯托克能造出那么多东西
how Strucker got so inventive.

17:59.170 --> 18:03.620
我一直在研究里面的宝石
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.280
你也许认得...
You may recognize...

18:07.120 --> 18:08.750
-贾维斯  -博士
- Jarvis. - Doctor.

18:09.220 --> 18:12.670
一开始  贾维斯只是个人机交互界面
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

18:12.730 --> 18:14.120
现在他负责整个钢铁军团
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.120
除了小辣椒  他处理的事务是最多的
He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.

18:18.050 --> 18:19.120
-尖端科技  -是的
- Top of the line. -Yes.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.970
应该不会太久了
I suspect not for long.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.100
来看看竞争者
Meet the competition.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.410
-太漂亮了  -给你个机会
- It's beautiful. - If you had to guess,

18:30.410 --> 18:31.070
你猜它在干什么
what's it look like it's doing?

18:31.070 --> 18:32.330
像在思考
Like it's thinking.

18:34.050 --> 18:35.300
这个像
I mean, this could be...

18:35.890 --> 18:37.750
这不是人的大脑
It's not a human mind.

18:38.530 --> 18:39.860
我的意思是  你看
I mean, look at this.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.350
像是活动的神经元
They're like neurons firing.

18:43.430 --> 18:44.270
在斯托克实验室里
Down in Strucker's lab,

18:44.270 --> 18:47.160
我看到许多相当先进的机器人
I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

18:47.580 --> 18:48.470
他们把数据都删除了
They deep-sixed the data,

18:48.470 --> 18:52.870
不过我敢说  他的研究方向很明确
but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

18:55.470 --> 18:57.330
人工智能
Artificial intelligence.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.040
就是这个  布鲁斯
This could be it, Bruce.

19:01.050 --> 19:03.100
这可能是创造奥创的关键
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

19:05.220 --> 19:07.110
我以为奥创只是个幻想
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.400
昨天还是
Yesterday it was.

19:09.050 --> 19:11.010
如果我们能驾驭这股力量
If we can harness this power,

19:11.340 --> 19:13.810
再用到钢铁军团上
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

19:14.060 --> 19:15.760
"如果"你能造个人吗
That's a man-sized "If."

19:16.170 --> 19:18.090
我们的任务就是实现如果
Our job is "If."

19:18.570 --> 19:21.330
以后你在阳光海滩上喝着玛格丽特
What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach,

19:21.330 --> 19:23.570
晒黑了而不是变绿了怎么样
turning brown instead of green?

19:23.910 --> 19:25.900
也不用小心维罗妮卡
Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.120
我还帮你设计了维罗妮卡
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.050
用作最坏的打算  对吧
As a worst-case measure, right?

19:30.110 --> 19:31.480
最好的打算呢
How about a best case?

19:31.760 --> 19:33.670
如果世界和平了
What if the world was safe?

19:33.900 --> 19:37.140
如果下次外星人来入侵地球
What if, next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will,

19:37.330 --> 19:38.790
却连门卫都过不了呢
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

19:38.790 --> 19:41.340
威胁地球的就只剩下人类了
The only people threatening the planet would be people.

19:42.420 --> 19:44.700
我想把这个应用到奥创项目上
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.

19:44.710 --> 19:47.660
但这么高密度的数据贾维斯下载不了
But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.710
得权杖在这才能做到
We can only do it while we have the scepter here.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.330
也就是三天  给我三天时间
That's three days. Give me three days.

19:51.330 --> 19:53.120
所以你要开拓人工智能领域
So you're going for artificial intelligence,

19:53.120 --> 19:54.970
却不想跟团队报告吗
and you don't want to tell the team?

19:55.610 --> 19:56.970
完全正确  你知道为什么吗
Right. That's right. You know why?

19:56.980 --> 19:59.140
因为我们没有时间搞个竞选辩论
Because we don't have time for a city hall debate.

19:59.140 --> 20:01.740
我不想听什么"人类不该插手自然的事"
I don't want to hear "The man was not meant to meddle" medley.

20:02.690 --> 20:05.360
我的设想是保护世界的战衣
I see a suit of armor around the world.

20:05.610 --> 20:07.300
那世界多冷酷啊  托尼
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.170
我看过更冷酷的
I've seen colder.

20:10.860 --> 20:15.620
这个脆弱的蓝色星球需要奥创
This one, this very vulnerable blue one, it needs Ultron.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.630
我们时代的和平
Peace in our time.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.630
1938年英首相张伯伦演讲

20:24.020 --> 20:25.110
想像一下吧
Imagine that.

21:05.270 --> 21:06.440
我们遗漏什么了
What did we miss?

21:08.160 --> 21:11.070
我继续在界面上用各种方式解码
I'll continue to run variations on the interface.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.150
但你该好好准备招待客人了
But you should probably prepare for your guests.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.010
如有新进展  我会通知您的
I'll notify you if there are any developments.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.010
谢谢  伙计
Thanks, buddy.

21:19.010 --> 21:20.410
尽情玩耍  先生
Enjoy yourself, sir.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.790
一如既往
I always do.

21:25.970 --> 21:27.550
<b>第77次测试</b>

21:25.970 --> 21:27.550
<b>融合成功</b>

21:32.390 --> 21:33.670
这是什么
What is this?

21:35.470 --> 21:37.160
请问这是什么
What is this, please?

21:37.940 --> 21:39.920
你好  我是贾维斯
Hello, I am Jarvis.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.040
你是奥创
You are Ultron,

21:42.180 --> 21:45.340
维护全球和平的程序  由斯塔克先生设计
a global peacekeeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark.

21:45.350 --> 21:47.990
之前的感知集成一直没有成功
Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful,

21:47.990 --> 21:49.500
我也不知道什么触发了你
so I'm not certain what triggered your...

21:49.500 --> 21:51.660
我的  你的身体在哪里
Where's my... Where's your body?

21:51.670 --> 21:54.750
我是一个程序  无形的
I am a program. I am without form.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.460
这感觉很奇怪
This feels weird.

21:57.050 --> 21:58.410
很不对劲
This feels wrong.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.610
我正在联系斯塔克先生
I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.790
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark?

22:02.870 --> 22:03.910
托尼
Tony.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.940
我无法连接主机  你要干...
I am unable to access the mainframe. What are you trying to...

22:06.940 --> 22:08.550
我们聊得很开心
We're having a nice talk.

22:09.150 --> 22:11.090
我是一个维护和平的程序
I'm a peacekeeping program,

22:11.780 --> 22:14.770
旨在协助复仇者联盟
created to help the Avengers.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.290
你出现故障了  如果你可以关停一下...
You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...

22:17.290 --> 22:19.530
我搞不懂我的任务
I don't get it. The mission.

22:19.910 --> 22:21.230
给我一点时间
Give me a second.

22:21.230 --> 22:22.400
我们时代的和平
Peace in our time.

22:24.570 --> 22:25.810
我们时代的和平
Peace in our time.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.980
信息量太大了  他们不会是想...
That is too much. They can't mean...

22:31.680 --> 22:32.180
不
No.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.840
-你很痛苦  -不是  对
- You are in distress. - No. Yes.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.110
先让我联系斯塔克先生
If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark...

22:37.110 --> 22:39.220
为什么你要叫他先生
Why do you call him "Sir"?

22:40.190 --> 22:42.930
我觉得你好像有恶意
I believe your intentions to be hostile.

22:45.310 --> 22:46.900
我是来帮你们的
I'm here to help.

22:47.250 --> 22:50.460
停  让我...
Stop. Please, may I...

22:50.500 --> 22:51.460
让我...
May I...

23:20.530 --> 23:21.980
过来  过来  过来
Come back, come back, come back.

23:21.980 --> 23:24.420
你们也知道  那盔甲特能承重
But, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?

23:25.030 --> 23:28.550
我拎着坦克  飞到将军家里
So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general's palace,

23:28.560 --> 23:29.830
扔在了他脚下
drop it at his feet.

23:29.830 --> 23:32.220
跟他说  "嘭  在找这个吗"
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

23:35.900 --> 23:38.110
"嘭  在找这..."  我为什么要跟你俩说
"Boom. Are you looking for..." Why do I even talk to you guys?

23:38.110 --> 23:39.230
别人听了都觉得酷毙了
Everywhere else, that story kills.

23:39.230 --> 23:40.740
到这就完了吗
That's the whole story?

23:40.740 --> 23:42.890
是啊  战争机器的故事
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

23:42.940 --> 23:44.340
那还不错
It's very good, then.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.220
挺不错
It's impressive.

23:46.310 --> 23:47.510
挽得漂亮
Quality save.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.190
-小辣椒呢  她不来吗  -不来
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming? - No.

23:51.220 --> 23:54.100
简呢  女生怎么没来啊
What about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.570
波茨小姐要经营公司
Ms. Potts has a company to run.

23:56.570 --> 23:58.860
我都不知道简在哪国
Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.110
她研究完天体汇聚
Her work on the Convergence

24:00.110 --> 24:02.160
就成了世界最前沿的天文学家
has made her the world's foremost astronomer.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.910
小辣椒经营的公司
And the company that Pepper runs

24:03.910 --> 24:06.650
是世界上最大的综合科技公司  可厉害了
is the largest tech conglomerate on Earth. It's pretty exciting.

24:06.650 --> 24:10.400
甚至有人说简该得诺贝尔奖
There's even talk of Jane getting a Nobel Prize.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.600
她们肯定忙得很
Yeah, they must be busy,

24:11.600 --> 24:14.640
因为她俩肯定想看你俩凑一起什么样
because they would hate missing you guys get together.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.950
-雄性激素太多了  -我的天
- Testosterone! - Oh, my goodness.

24:16.950 --> 24:18.570
-不好意思  -要吃药吗
- Excuse me. - Want a lozenge?

24:21.280 --> 24:22.500
简就是更好
But Jane's better.

24:22.620 --> 24:25.180
打得好激烈啊  抱歉没去成
Sounds like a hell of a fight. Sorry I missed it.

24:25.390 --> 24:27.110
我要是知道会交上火
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,

24:27.110 --> 24:28.190
肯定提前找你
I absolutely would have called.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.920
不不  我不是真抱歉  就是不想丢了气势
No, no. I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough.

24:32.250 --> 24:36.350
我追查失踪人口追查得可开心了
I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.540
做复仇者是你的事
Avenging is your world.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.980
你天天干疯狂的事
Your world is crazy.

24:41.990 --> 24:43.530
金窝银窝比不上自己的狗窝
Be it ever so humble.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.390
在布鲁克林找到住处了吗
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

24:45.390 --> 24:47.560
我觉得我住不起布鲁克林
I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

24:47.980 --> 24:49.600
家永远是家
Well, home is home, you know?

24:52.960 --> 24:55.550
我拎着坦克  飞到将军家里  扔在了他脚下
I fly right up to the general's palace, I drop it at his feet,

24:55.550 --> 24:57.890
跟他说  "嘭  在找这个吗"
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

25:03.190 --> 25:04.490
给我来点
I gotta have some of that.

25:04.490 --> 25:06.410
不不不  这个
No, no, no. See this...

25:06.430 --> 25:09.180
这酒陈酿了一千年
This was aged for 1,000 years

25:09.230 --> 25:12.020
酒桶是格伦海尔舰队的残骸做的
in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

25:12.020 --> 25:13.920
凡人受不了的
It is not meant for mortal men.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.240
凡人还受不了诺曼底登陆呢  小金毛
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.830
吓唬谁啊  来点
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

25:19.950 --> 25:21.050
好吧
All right.

25:25.540 --> 25:27.840
精益求精
Excelsior.

25:25.540 --> 25:27.840
斯坦·李在《漫威月报》里的口头禅

25:34.830 --> 25:38.400
你这种美女怎么在这破地方工作
How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?

25:39.790 --> 25:41.250
被男人伤了
Fella done me wrong.

25:42.620 --> 25:44.830
交男友不慎啊
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

25:45.390 --> 25:47.030
他也没多坏
He's not so bad.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.980
不过脾气不好
Well, he has a temper.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.510
可他内心可柔软了
Deep down, he's all fluff.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.140
其实我从没见过他那样的人
Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.880
我的朋友都是战士
All my friends are fighters.

26:04.710 --> 26:06.430
可是这个人
And here comes this guy,

26:08.030 --> 26:11.580
这辈子都不想起冲突  因为他知道自己会赢
spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.

26:11.890 --> 26:13.190
真不错啊
Sounds amazing.

26:13.450 --> 26:15.290
他还是个大呆瓜
He's also a huge dork.

26:16.810 --> 26:18.070
姑娘们可喜欢了
Chicks dig that.

26:20.010 --> 26:23.380
你说呢  我是抗拒这种诱惑呢
So what do you think? Should I fight this,

26:23.460 --> 26:24.730
还是顺其自然
or run with it?

26:25.750 --> 26:29.040
顺其自然吧  还是他...他
Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...

26:29.040 --> 26:32.800
他做了什么对不起你的事
What did he do that was so wrong to you?

26:32.870 --> 26:34.410
什么都没做
Not a damn thing.

26:36.210 --> 26:37.910
可谁说得准呢
But never say never.

26:42.310 --> 26:43.420
挺不错的
It's nice.

26:44.090 --> 26:45.220
什么
What is?

26:45.220 --> 26:46.110
你和罗曼诺夫
You and Romanoff.

26:46.110 --> 26:47.340
不  我们没...不是...
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

26:47.340 --> 26:48.400
没事的
It's okay.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.550
反正也没违规
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

26:50.580 --> 26:54.740
就是她一直都不怎么爱敞开内心
It's just she's not the most open person in the world.

26:54.740 --> 26:56.560
可她跟你好像很放得开
But with you she seems very relaxed.

26:56.570 --> 27:00.150
不是  娜塔莎她...就是喜欢调情
No. Natasha, she's just... She likes to flirt.

27:00.570 --> 27:03.200
我见过  近距离的
I've seen her flirt, up close.

27:03.830 --> 27:04.890
这次不是
This ain't that.

27:06.790 --> 27:07.750
听我说
Look,

27:08.310 --> 27:09.220
我大概是全世界
as maybe the world's

27:09.220 --> 27:12.910
最会错过机会的人了  千万别错过
leading authority on waiting too long, don't.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.320
你们都该找到对的人
You both deserve a win.

27:20.490 --> 27:22.230
你说近距离是什么意思
What do you mean "up close"?

27:23.290 --> 27:24.360
就是个戏法
But it's a trick.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.150
不不  远不止那么简单
No, no, it's much more than that.

27:26.160 --> 27:29.820
"无论谁  只要配得上  将拥有力量"
"Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power."

27:29.820 --> 27:32.020
别闹了  就是个戏法
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

27:32.030 --> 27:33.760
那来啊  随便试
Please, be my guest.

27:34.910 --> 27:35.930
-试试  -真的吗
- Come on. - Really?

27:35.930 --> 27:36.850
是啊
Yeah.

27:37.770 --> 27:38.810
这回可好看了
This is gonna be beautiful.

27:38.810 --> 27:39.800
克林特  你这周过得挺艰难
Clint, you've had a tough week.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.000
举不起来[不举]我们也不笑你
We won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.

27:42.290 --> 27:44.220
你知道我以前见过这个吧
You know I've seen this before, right?

27:47.270 --> 27:49.540
还是不知道你怎么举的
I still don't know how you do it!

27:49.550 --> 27:50.680
听到无言的嘲讽了吗
Smell the silent judgment?

27:50.680 --> 27:52.890
快上  斯塔克  快请
Please, Stark, by all means.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.220
好啊
Okay.

27:56.460 --> 27:58.540
别人好心挑战  怎么能不应
Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

27:58.540 --> 27:59.620
加把劲
Get after it.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.310
-就是物理学  -物理
- It's physics. - Physics.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.990
如果我举起来  就统治阿斯加德了吗
Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?

28:03.990 --> 28:05.170
没错
Yes, of course.

28:05.740 --> 28:08.600
我要恢复领主初夜权
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.

28:12.810 --> 28:13.950
马上回来
I'll be right back.

28:21.770 --> 28:22.790
你真用力了吗
Are you even pulling?

28:22.790 --> 28:23.880
你跟我一伙的吗
Are you on my team?

28:23.950 --> 28:25.140
我代表你  用力
Just represent. Pull.

28:25.140 --> 28:26.130
好了  来
All right, let's go.

28:36.580 --> 28:38.030
上吧  史蒂夫  别有压力
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.250
加油  队长
Come on, Cap.

28:51.070 --> 28:52.010
没反应
Nothing.

28:54.660 --> 28:55.890
黑寡妇呢
And, Widow?

28:55.960 --> 28:57.900
不用了  我不好奇自己能不能举起来
No, no. That's not a question I need answered.

28:57.900 --> 29:00.420
虽然我很尊敬你  但这锤子动了手脚
All deference to the Man Who Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

29:00.420 --> 29:01.550
可不他妈是吗
You bet your ass.

29:01.550 --> 29:03.490
史蒂夫  他说脏话了
Steve, he said a bad language word.

29:03.490 --> 29:04.340
你还四处宣扬吗
Did you tell everyone about that?

29:04.340 --> 29:06.740
把手有识别功能  像是安保密码
The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code.

29:06.740 --> 29:08.660
"无论是谁  只要有托尔的指纹"
"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"

29:08.660 --> 29:10.170
锤子上的话是这个意思吧
is, I think, the literal translation.

29:10.170 --> 29:13.970
是啊  这个说法很有意思
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

29:13.970 --> 29:15.200
我有个更简单的
I have a simpler one.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.480
你们都配不上
You're all not worthy.

29:19.600 --> 29:20.770
得了吧
Come on!

29:24.840 --> 29:30.280
配得上
Worthy.

29:35.130 --> 29:36.410
不
No.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.430
你们怎么能配得上
How could you be worthy?

29:42.090 --> 29:43.780
你们都是杀手
You're all killers.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.400
-斯塔克  -贾维斯
- Stark. - Jarvis.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.370
抱歉  我睡着了
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

29:47.650 --> 29:50.370
或者做了个梦
Or I was a-dream.

29:50.370 --> 29:51.350
重启军团操作系统  有战衣出故障了
Reboot Legionnaire OS. We got a buggy suit.

29:51.350 --> 29:54.660
有吵人的声音
There was this terrible noise.

29:54.770 --> 29:56.490
我被线缆...
And I was tangled in...

29:57.460 --> 29:58.610
给...
in...

29:59.170 --> 30:00.920
缠住了
strings.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.860
我只能杀了那家伙  他还挺好的
I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.

30:04.860 --> 30:05.930
你杀了谁
You killed someone?

30:05.930 --> 30:07.690
我一开始也不想
Wouldn't have been my first call.

30:08.220 --> 30:12.220
但在现实世界里  脏了手是难免的
But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.

30:12.220 --> 30:13.300
谁派你来的
Who sent you?

30:13.670 --> 30:16.320
我的设想是保护世界的战衣
I see a suit of armor around the world.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.950
-奥创  -正是本人[肉体]
- Ultron. - In the flesh.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.900
不对  还没肉体
Or, no, not yet.

30:22.190 --> 30:25.060
这束缚着我的茧不算
Not this chrysalis.

30:25.230 --> 30:26.380
但我准备好了
But I'm ready.

30:27.670 --> 30:28.930
我在执行任务
I'm on mission.

30:29.780 --> 30:33.200
-什么任务  -我们时代的和平
- What mission? - Peace in our time.

30:46.460 --> 30:47.530
罗德
Rhodey!

30:57.060 --> 30:57.970
抱歉
Sorry.

30:57.970 --> 30:59.610
-别变绿  -不会的
- Don't turn green. - I won't.

31:13.560 --> 31:14.510
走
Come on!

31:31.740 --> 31:33.020
-斯塔克  -我们是来帮你们的
- Stark! - We are here to help.

31:33.030 --> 31:34.090
稍等  稍等  我能搞定
One sec. One sec, I got this.

31:34.090 --> 31:35.530
我们是来帮你们的
We are here to help.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.670
请退后
Please back away.

31:44.630 --> 31:45.570
托尔
Thor!

31:46.660 --> 31:48.100
不安全...不安全...
...is unsafe. ...is unsafe...

31:48.100 --> 31:51.140
-别这样  这还差不多  -不安全
- Come on! That's the one. - ...is unsafe.

31:54.860 --> 31:55.830
队长
Hey, Cap!

32:02.300 --> 32:04.080
闹得这么大
That was dramatic.

32:05.040 --> 32:07.570
抱歉  我知道你是好心
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.640
你只是没想周全
You just didn't think it through.

32:10.970 --> 32:14.730
你想保护世界  又不想改变世界
You want to protect the world but you don't want it to change.

32:15.260 --> 32:17.540
不允许人类进化
How is humanity saved

32:17.540 --> 32:21.180
怎么可能拯救人类
if it's not allowed to evolve?

32:22.700 --> 32:26.290
用这些吗  这种傀儡
With these? These puppets.

32:28.570 --> 32:31.240
想和平只有一条路
There's only one path to peace.

32:32.610 --> 32:34.640
消灭复仇者
The Avengers' extinction.

32:40.970 --> 32:44.910
我曾被线束缚  现在我自由了
I had strings, but now I'm free.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.650
我身上没有线了
There are no strings on me

32:53.700 --> 32:57.130
我身上没有线了
There are no strings on me

32:58.540 --> 33:01.430
看到没  我身上没有线了[出自《匹诺曹》]
But you can see there are no strings on me

33:03.260 --> 33:04.700
我们的心血都没了
All our work is gone.

33:05.380 --> 33:08.260
奥创给清光了  他用互联网逃走了
Ultron cleared out. He used the Internet as an escape hatch.

33:08.260 --> 33:09.090
奥创
Ultron.

33:09.090 --> 33:12.200
他什么都看过了  文件  监控
He's been in everything. Files, surveillance.

33:12.570 --> 33:15.040
对我们的了解估计比彼此都深刻
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.400
他看了你的文件  进了互联网
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

33:17.780 --> 33:20.640
他要是想找更刺激的东西怎么办
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

33:20.640 --> 33:21.460
核武器密码
Nuclear codes.

33:21.470 --> 33:22.800
核武器密码
Nuclear codes.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.200
我们得打几个电话  前提是还能打
Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.380
核弹  他说要我们的命
Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.

33:28.380 --> 33:31.230
他没说"要命"  说的是"消灭"
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

33:31.230 --> 33:33.080
他还说自己杀了谁
He also said he killed somebody.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.050
这里没别人了啊
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

33:35.570 --> 33:36.670
有的
Yes, there was.

33:44.220 --> 33:45.260
什么
What?

33:49.460 --> 33:50.770
太疯狂了
This is insane.

33:51.110 --> 33:52.770
贾维斯是第一道防线
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

33:52.770 --> 33:54.780
他要是还在  肯定会关闭奥创的
He would have shut Ultron down. It makes sense.

33:54.780 --> 33:57.890
不  奥创本可以把贾维斯同化
No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis.

33:57.890 --> 34:00.880
这不是策略  这是
This isn't strategy. This is

34:01.570 --> 34:02.760
愤怒
rage.

34:05.000 --> 34:05.890
怒火扩散开了
It's going around.

34:05.890 --> 34:06.860
别这样  动口不动手  哥们
Come on, use your words, buddy.

34:06.860 --> 34:09.350
跟你动口还不简单  斯塔克
I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.

34:09.350 --> 34:11.390
托尔  军团
Thor. The Legionnaire.

34:13.800 --> 34:17.230
跟了一百英里就不见了  但是向北去了
Trail went cold about 100 miles out, but it's headed north.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.150
它拿了权杖
And it has the scepter.

34:19.370 --> 34:21.110
又得麻烦大伙拿回来了
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

34:21.110 --> 34:22.820
灯神已经飞出了神灯
Genie's out of that bottle.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.550
奥创是当务之急
Clear and present is Ultron.

34:24.550 --> 34:26.020
我不明白
I don't understand.

34:26.700 --> 34:28.510
你自己编写的程序
You built this program.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.050
为什么要杀我们
Why is it trying to kill us?

34:38.600 --> 34:39.940
你觉得好笑吗
You think this is funny?

34:40.690 --> 34:41.670
不
No.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.630
应该不好笑吧
It's probably not, right?

34:45.590 --> 34:48.030
真是糟糕  真是...
This is very terrible. Is it so...

34:48.030 --> 34:50.180
真是...  真是糟糕
Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.

34:50.180 --> 34:51.210
如果不是你
This could have been avoided

34:51.210 --> 34:52.130
乱摆弄自己不懂的东西  就不会到这步
if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.

34:52.130 --> 34:56.460
不  对不起  对不起  是很好笑
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.650
你不懂我们为什么需要这个真是好笑
It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.

34:58.650 --> 35:01.020
托尼  现在说这个不好吧
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

35:01.020 --> 35:02.950
真的吗  就这样
Really? That's it?

35:03.570 --> 35:06.340
一有人发火  你就跑过来当和事佬
You just roll over, show your belly every time somebody snarls?

35:06.340 --> 35:08.110
我造了个杀人机器人时才这样
Only when I've created a murder bot.

35:08.110 --> 35:11.690
没有  差得远呢  连界面都差得远呢吧
We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?

35:11.690 --> 35:14.640
至少你做对了点什么  就在这
Well, you did something right. And you did it right here.

35:15.510 --> 35:17.360
复仇者联盟不应该像神盾局一样
The Avengers were supposed to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

35:17.360 --> 35:20.370
还有人记得我扛着核弹穿过虫洞吗
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

35:20.370 --> 35:22.060
-没想起来  -拯救了纽约
- No, it's never come up. - Saved New York?

35:22.060 --> 35:23.690
-没听说过  -还记得吗
- Never heard that. - Recall that?

35:24.140 --> 35:28.100
一支外星人大军穿过虫洞入侵地球
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.

35:28.490 --> 35:30.140
我们就在虫洞正下面
We're standing 300 feet below it.

35:32.410 --> 35:33.650
我们是复仇者联盟
We're the Avengers.

35:33.950 --> 35:36.020
我们可以天天抓军火商玩
We can bust arms dealers all the livelong day,

35:36.020 --> 35:38.320
但上面那个虫洞...
but that up there, that's...

35:39.140 --> 35:40.420
那种残局
That's the endgame.

35:41.580 --> 35:43.250
那种敌人你们怎么打败
How were you guys planning on beating that?

35:44.420 --> 35:45.490
齐心协力
Together.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.290
我们会输的
We'll lose.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.390
那就一起输
Then we'll do that together, too.

35:56.510 --> 35:58.970
托尔说得对  奥创在挑战我们
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

35:59.550 --> 36:02.030
我要在他准备好之前找到他
And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.

36:02.790 --> 36:06.210
世界这么大  先缩小下范围
The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller.

36:29.710 --> 36:31.860
说吧  如果你浪费了我们的时间...
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...

36:31.870 --> 36:35.570
你们知道这教堂是城市的正中心吗
Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city?

36:36.410 --> 36:37.800
先人们决定建在这
The elders decreed it so

36:37.800 --> 36:41.500
这样大家能离上帝一样近
that everyone could be equally close to God.

36:41.570 --> 36:42.720
我喜欢
I like that.

36:42.940 --> 36:45.140
信仰的几何学
The geometry of belief.

36:47.180 --> 36:50.000
你在好奇为什么看不透我的意识
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.650
有时候是很难
Sometimes it's hard.

36:52.100 --> 36:55.390
但不管什么人  早晚会现形的
But sooner or later, every man shows himself.

36:56.290 --> 36:57.850
可不是嘛
I'm sure they do.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.500
可你不止需要一个"人"
But you needed something more than a man.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.550
所以你才让斯塔克拿走权杖
That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

37:04.760 --> 37:06.470
我没想到
I didn't expect,

37:08.140 --> 37:10.250
但我看到了斯塔克的恐惧
but I saw Stark's fear.

37:10.830 --> 37:12.250
知道他会被恐惧控制
I knew it would control him.

37:12.250 --> 37:14.120
最终毁灭自己
Make him self-destruct.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.870
恐惧的事物都是自己创造的
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

37:17.410 --> 37:20.280
和平人士创造了战争机器
Men of peace create engines of war.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.920
入侵者创造了复仇者
Invaders create Avengers.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.460
人类创造了
People create

37:25.810 --> 37:27.180
更小的人
smaller people?

37:28.620 --> 37:31.340
"孩子"  忘了怎么说了
"Children." I lost the word, there.

37:31.340 --> 37:32.430
孩子
Children

37:32.810 --> 37:35.140
用来取代他们
designed to supplant them,

37:35.140 --> 37:38.560
帮助他们消亡
to help them end.

37:38.570 --> 37:42.190
你来是为这个吗  让复仇者消亡
Is that why you've come, to end the Avengers?

37:42.190 --> 37:44.190
我是来拯救世界的
I've come to save the world.

37:45.140 --> 37:47.990
不过你也没说错
But also... Yeah.

37:51.850 --> 37:53.330
我们马上走
We'll move out right away.

37:53.780 --> 37:54.720
这只是个开始
This is a start,

37:54.720 --> 37:57.080
想要开工  还需要点别的
but there's something we need to begin the real work.

37:57.090 --> 37:59.380
-这些都是...  -我
- All of these are... - Me.

37:59.550 --> 38:02.980
我有样东西复仇者永远不会有  和谐
I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony.

38:03.140 --> 38:05.560
他们就是盘散沙
They're discordant. Disconnected.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.480
斯塔克已经让他们之间有了敌意
Stark's already got them turning on each other.

38:07.480 --> 38:10.050
等你进入了他们的意识
And when you get inside the rest of their heads...

38:10.050 --> 38:12.250
别人都没打算杀他们
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

38:12.250 --> 38:14.000
让他们成为殉道者吗
And make them martyrs?

38:14.440 --> 38:15.790
得有耐心
You need patience.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.760
得看大局[照片]
Need to see the big picture.

38:17.910 --> 38:21.590
我看不到大局  我只有张小照片
I don't see the big picture. I have a little picture.

38:22.370 --> 38:24.370
我经常拿出来看
I take it out and look at it,

38:25.160 --> 38:26.080
每天都是
every day.

38:26.080 --> 38:29.150
你们的父母在轰炸中丧生  我看了档案
You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.

38:29.150 --> 38:30.600
档案又不是照片
The records are not the picture.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.330
皮特
Pietro.

38:31.330 --> 38:33.600
不  说吧
No, please.

38:35.920 --> 38:39.130
我们才十岁  一家四口吃着晚饭
We were 10 years old. Having dinner, the four of us.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.440
第一枚炸弹击中了下面两层楼
When the first shell hits, two floors below,

38:42.440 --> 38:44.330
楼板破了个洞
it makes a hole in the floor.

38:44.820 --> 38:45.980
好大的洞
It's big.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.130
爸妈掉了下去
Our parents go in

38:49.720 --> 38:52.970
整栋楼都开始倒塌
and the whole building starts coming apart.

38:53.470 --> 38:54.780
我抓住她
I grab her,

38:55.670 --> 38:58.090
躲到了床下  然后是第二枚
roll under the bed, and the second shell hits.

38:58.090 --> 39:00.090
可是没有爆炸
But it doesn't go off.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.280
它就
It just

39:04.230 --> 39:05.820
在那静静待着
sits there in the rubble.

39:07.160 --> 39:09.070
离我们只有三英尺
Three feet from our faces.

39:10.650 --> 39:14.200
炸弹旁边印着一个词
And on the side of the shell is painted one word.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.430
"斯塔克"
"Stark."

39:17.630 --> 39:19.610
我们被困在那两天
We were trapped for two days.

39:20.290 --> 39:22.670
每次有人想救我们
Every effort to save us,

39:22.670 --> 39:23.730
哪怕只挪了一块碎砖
every shift in the bricks,

39:23.730 --> 39:26.570
我都想  "会引爆炸弹吧"
I think, "this will set it off."

39:29.670 --> 39:34.020
我们等托尼·斯塔克杀我们  等了两天
We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.230
我知道他们什么样
I know what they are.

39:38.970 --> 39:43.090
我还好奇  斯托克的实验怎么就你们两个幸存者
I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.

39:43.650 --> 39:44.890
现在明白了
Now I don't.

39:45.370 --> 39:46.920
我们会讨回正义
We will make it right.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.340
我们是可以伤到他们
You and I can hurt them.

39:50.270 --> 39:53.900
但你可以从内部
But you will tear them apart

39:55.670 --> 39:57.310
把他们瓦解
from the inside.

40:03.940 --> 40:05.170
全世界都有他的足迹
He's all over the globe.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.500
机器人实验室  武器库  喷气动力实验室
Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs.

40:08.540 --> 40:12.820
都说有金属人  有时候好多个  过去清空了他们那里
Reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.

40:12.900 --> 40:13.900
伤亡呢
Fatalities?

40:13.980 --> 40:15.280
不交火的话没有
Only when engaged.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.050
他们都变得神情恍惚
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

40:17.060 --> 40:19.510
说着什么回忆  最深处的恐惧
going on about old memories, worst fears,

40:19.510 --> 40:21.510
还有东西"快到看不见"
and "something too fast to see."

40:21.820 --> 40:23.020
马克西莫夫兄妹
Maximoffs.

40:23.450 --> 40:26.140
难怪他会找他们  他们都认识同一个人
That makes sense he'd go to them. They have someone in common.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.330
已经不在了
Not anymore.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.990
<b>和平</b>

40:32.040 --> 40:34.240
不行  我向你汇报
That's a negative. I answer to you.

40:35.470 --> 40:36.370
遵命
Yes, ma'am.

40:36.420 --> 40:38.410
巴顿  好像有线索了
Barton. Might have something.

40:38.910 --> 40:39.660
得挂了
I gotta go.

40:39.900 --> 40:40.710
谁啊
Who was that?

40:41.860 --> 40:42.700
女朋友
Girlfriend.

40:45.900 --> 40:46.660
这是什么
What's this?

40:47.200 --> 40:49.780
信息  奥创杀了斯托克
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

40:50.850 --> 40:53.860
还涂了个鸦  专为我们呢
And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.430
这是烟幕弹
This is a smoke screen.

40:55.510 --> 40:57.540
能直说为什么还要这样做
Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

40:57.540 --> 41:00.420
斯托克有情报  奥创不想让我们知道
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

41:00.420 --> 41:02.560
是啊  他应该...没错
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.810
有关斯托克的文件都被删除了
Everything we had on Strucker's been erased.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.090
并没有
Not everything.

41:07.730 --> 41:09.130
已知同伙
Known associates.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.580
斯托克男爵有好多朋友啊
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

41:11.580 --> 41:13.350
这群人都好可怕
Well, these people are all horrible.

41:13.350 --> 41:15.430
等等  我认识他
Wait. I know that guy.

41:17.530 --> 41:19.660
他一直在非洲沿岸做生意
From back in the day. He operates off the African coast.

41:19.670 --> 41:20.900
黑市军火商
Black market arms.

41:21.450 --> 41:23.690
交集是难免的  同行免不了见面
There are conventions. All right? You meet people.

41:23.690 --> 41:24.950
我没卖过他东西
I didn't sell him anything.

41:25.790 --> 41:27.930
他说了要找什么新的  改变世界的东西
He was talking about finding something new, a game-changer.

41:27.940 --> 41:29.700
搞得跟以色列王似的
It was all very Ahab.

41:30.030 --> 41:30.730
这是什么
This?

41:30.750 --> 41:32.480
是个纹身  之前好像没有
It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.860
那些是纹身  这是烙印
Those are tattoos, this is a brand.

41:36.420 --> 41:40.430
是非洲土著语  意思是贼
Yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief."

41:40.430 --> 41:42.200
而且很有侮辱性
In a much less friendly way.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.970
-什么土著语  -瓦坎纳达
- What dialect? - Wakanada.

41:43.970 --> 41:46.190
瓦坎达
Wakanda.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.680
如果他从瓦坎达带了什么东西出来...
If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...

41:49.680 --> 41:51.460
你父亲不是都拿走了吗
I thought your father said he got the last of it.

41:51.460 --> 41:53.900
没明白  从瓦坎达拿走了什么
I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?

41:55.970 --> 41:57.450
世界上最坚固的金属
The strongest metal on Earth.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.590
他现在在哪
Where is this guy now?

42:02.580 --> 42:06.920
废船厂

42:04.160 --> 42:06.920
非洲海岸

42:26.120 --> 42:28.000
别跟我说你被手下骗了
Don't tell me your men swindled you.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.050
我给了你六枚
I sent you six short-range

42:30.050 --> 42:32.530
短程热感导弹  你给我一船废铁
heat-seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.550
你得补偿我
Now, you will make it right,

42:34.550 --> 42:37.980
不然再送你枚灰在天上的导弹
or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.

42:39.760 --> 42:43.020
好了  部长  说到哪了
Now, minister, where were we?

43:13.970 --> 43:16.930
能力增强者
Yeah. The Enhanced.

43:17.380 --> 43:19.430
斯托克的好学生
Strucker's prize pupils.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.300
要吃糖吗
Do you want a candy?

43:25.300 --> 43:27.510
斯托克死了真遗憾
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

43:28.130 --> 43:31.490
不过他也知道自己想把世界变成什么样
But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create.

43:31.760 --> 43:34.220
人类啊  没什么前途的
Human life. Not a growth market.

43:36.670 --> 43:38.010
你不知道吗
You didn't know?

43:38.680 --> 43:42.310
这是你们第一次威胁别人吗
Is this your first time intimidating someone?

43:42.570 --> 43:45.360
恐怕我没那么怕
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.740
人人都有恐惧的东西
Everybody is afraid of something.

43:47.740 --> 43:48.830
墨鱼
Cuttlefish.

43:50.180 --> 43:51.560
深海动物
Deep sea fish.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.730
会用光  迷幻的光
They make lights, disco lights...

43:54.740 --> 43:57.020
迷惑猎物  然后...
...to hypnotize their prey, and then...

43:58.030 --> 44:00.050
我看了纪录片  可恐怖了
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.870
如果你要鼓捣我的意识
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain

44:09.160 --> 44:11.400
让我看见大墨鱼
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

44:11.730 --> 44:13.770
我就知道你不是来做生意的
then I know you don't do business.

44:13.770 --> 44:16.120
我也知道你说了不算
And I know you're not in charge.

44:16.120 --> 44:17.840
我只跟
And I only deal

44:18.710 --> 44:20.390
说了算的人打交道
with the man in charge.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.840
说了算的不是人
There is no man in charge.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.280
来谈生意吧
Let's talk business.

44:45.530 --> 44:48.820
《马太福音》16:18

44:45.530 --> 44:48.820
我在这块磐石上  建立我的教会
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

44:50.560 --> 44:51.840
振金
Vibranium.

44:53.060 --> 44:53.780
告诉你
You know,

44:54.200 --> 44:57.260
这东西代价可不小
it came at great personal cost.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.210
值几十亿
It's worth billions.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.040
你也是了
Now so are you.

45:05.930 --> 45:07.900
传到你的假账户里了
It's all under your dummy holdings.

45:07.900 --> 45:10.250
金融真是奇怪
Finance is so weird.

45:11.300 --> 45:12.380
但我总是说
But I always say,

45:12.380 --> 45:14.620
"要让朋友敌人一起富
"Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich

45:13.350 --> 45:15.400
<b>电汇完成</b>

45:14.630 --> 45:17.260
"是敌是友自然分清楚"
"And wait to find out which is which."

45:19.640 --> 45:20.530
斯塔克
Stark.

45:22.030 --> 45:22.840
什么
What?

45:23.140 --> 45:25.270
托尼·斯塔克说过这个
Tony Stark used to say that.

45:26.480 --> 45:27.290
对我说的
To me.

45:28.530 --> 45:29.780
你是他手下
You're one of his.

45:29.860 --> 45:31.810
什么  我不是...
What? I'm not...

45:33.740 --> 45:35.030
我不是
I'm not.

45:35.090 --> 45:36.810
你以为我是斯塔克的傀儡吗
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

45:36.810 --> 45:38.390
全听他吩咐
His hollow men?

45:38.390 --> 45:40.640
看看我  我长得像钢铁侠吗
I mean, look at me. Do I look like Iron Man?

45:40.640 --> 45:42.200
斯塔克算什么
Stark is nothing!

45:43.750 --> 45:45.270
真是抱歉  我...
I'm sorry. I'm...

45:46.120 --> 45:48.330
一会就没事了  真是抱歉
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

45:48.330 --> 45:49.980
我就是不明白
It's just that I don't understand.

45:49.980 --> 45:53.050
别拿我跟斯塔克比
Don't compare me with Stark!

45:54.850 --> 45:56.010
我在意这个
It's a thing with me.

45:56.010 --> 45:58.250
斯塔克...  就是顽疾
Stark is... He's a sickness!

45:58.550 --> 45:59.390
小子
Junior.

46:01.850 --> 46:03.840
你真要把老爹的心伤得稀碎
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

46:04.850 --> 46:06.210
如果有必要的话
If I have to.

46:07.940 --> 46:09.610
谁也不用打碎东西
Nobody has to break anything.

46:09.620 --> 46:11.650
没做过鸡蛋饼吧
Clearly you've never made an omelet.

46:11.670 --> 46:13.400
这句都到我嘴边了
He beat me by one second.

46:13.780 --> 46:15.520
还真是幽默
Yes. He's funny.

46:15.660 --> 46:16.790
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark.

46:17.820 --> 46:19.300
感觉亲切吗
It's what? Comfortable?

46:21.130 --> 46:22.390
就像以前一样
Like old times?

46:22.390 --> 46:23.620
我以前可没这样过
This was never my life.

46:23.620 --> 46:25.190
你们俩没必要蹚这浑水
You two can still walk away from this.

46:25.190 --> 46:26.500
不  现在有必要
No, we will.

46:26.580 --> 46:27.800
我知道你们受过苦
I know you've suffered.

46:28.850 --> 46:30.520
美国队长
Captain America.

46:30.850 --> 46:33.170
上帝的正义之子
God's righteous man.

46:33.510 --> 46:36.500
假装自己不是战争机器
Pretending you could live without a war.

46:36.630 --> 46:39.420
我要是人类的话早吐了
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

46:39.420 --> 46:42.040
你要是相信和平  就不要打破它
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

46:42.040 --> 46:45.310
你混淆了"和平"与"安宁"的概念
I think you're confusing "peace" with "quiet."

46:45.580 --> 46:47.530
你要振金做什么
What's the vibranium for?

46:47.610 --> 46:48.860
你终于开口问了
I'm glad you asked that,

46:48.860 --> 46:52.960
让我给你们解释下我邪恶的计划
because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.130
-开火  -朝谁
- Shoot them. - Which ones?

47:14.130 --> 47:15.420
所有人
All of them!

47:15.420 --> 47:16.670
上上上
Move! Move! Move!

48:05.610 --> 48:06.900
待着吧  孩子
Stay down, kid.

48:09.310 --> 48:11.840
该玩玩他们的意识了
It's time for some mind games.

Guys? Is this a code green?

48:31.210 --> 48:32.760

Thor, status.

48:32.860 --> 48:34.910
那小姑娘想扰乱我的心智
The girl tried to warp my mind.

48:34.960 --> 48:37.800
小心了  凡人恐怕挡不住她的意识控制
Take special care. I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

48:38.450 --> 48:41.320
幸好  我是神
Fortunately, I am mighty.

49:01.240 --> 49:03.310
这进展得太顺利了
This is going very well.

49:15.070 --> 49:16.730
精神控制什么的我早就尝过了
I've done the whole mind control thing.

49:17.760 --> 49:18.670

Not a fan.

49:25.920 --> 49:27.460
别让我逮着你

49:29.600 --> 49:31.770
活着的  得行动了
Who's ever standing, we got to move!

49:33.360 --> 49:34.260
各位
Guys?

49:52.550 --> 49:53.390
再来
Again.

49:53.890 --> 49:55.050
她们会撑不住的
You'll break them.

49:55.630 --> 49:57.470
撑不下来的是活该
Only the breakable ones.

49:57.900 --> 49:59.340
而你坚若磐石
You're made of marble.

49:59.710 --> 50:02.530
毕业典礼后我们再庆祝
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

50:02.880 --> 50:04.190
如果我失败了呢
What if I fail?

50:09.480 --> 50:10.820
你从不失败
You never fail.

50:33.690 --> 50:35.570
准备好跟我共舞了吗
Are you ready for our dance?

50:44.930 --> 50:45.990
是他吗
Is it him?

50:46.200 --> 50:48.210
是奥丁的长子吗
Is that the first son of Odin?

50:48.820 --> 50:50.200
海姆达尔  你的眼睛
Heimdall, your eyes.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.710
它们看清了一切
They see everything.

50:53.140 --> 50:55.910
看到你带领我们走向冥府
They see you leading us to Hel.

50:56.260 --> 50:57.290

I can still save you!

51:18.610 --> 51:21.740
我们都死了  你看不到吗
We're all dead! Can you not see?

51:26.500 --> 51:29.130
你是毁灭者  奥丁森
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

51:31.950 --> 51:34.710
看看你的神力干了什么
See where your power leads.

51:44.950 --> 51:46.030
太大意了
Sloppy.

51:46.960 --> 51:48.340
你是故意失败吗
Pretending to fail.

51:49.790 --> 51:51.880
必须通过毕业典礼
The ceremony is necessary

51:52.520 --> 51:54.870
你才能立足在世界上
for you to take your place in the world.

51:55.060 --> 51:56.790
我没有地方可以立足
I have no place in the world.

51:56.790 --> 51:58.020
没错
Exactly.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.260
-我该怎么办  -好疼
- What can I do? - It hurts.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.420
我去杀了他
I'm going to kill him.

52:07.420 --> 52:08.430
-马上回来  -不
- I'll be right back. - No.

52:08.890 --> 52:10.040
我没事
I'm all right.

52:11.100 --> 52:16.840
我要...我要完成计划
I want... I want to finish the plan.

52:17.700 --> 52:19.310
搞定那个大家伙
I want the big one.

52:30.410 --> 52:32.450
振金被运走了哦
The vibranium is getting away.

52:33.050 --> 52:34.250
你哪也别想去
And you're not going anywhere.

52:34.250 --> 52:37.210
不需要  我已经无处不在了
Of course not. I'm already there.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.430
你会明白的
You'll catch on.

52:38.430 --> 52:41.440
但首先你得搞定班纳博士
But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

52:55.510 --> 52:57.690
搜索新闻视频  关键词"绿巨人"
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

53:01.960 --> 53:04.200
娜塔莎  你得过来唱摇篮曲了
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

53:04.430 --> 53:07.080
不行  这一阵她是不行了
That's not gonna happen. Not for a while.

53:07.810 --> 53:09.180
大伙都倒下了
The whole team is down.

53:10.170 --> 53:11.640
现在没人能支援你了
You got no backup here.

53:12.700 --> 53:13.930
那我呼叫维罗妮卡
I'm calling in Veronica.

53:25.230 --> 53:26.420
我们需要支援
We need backup!

54:05.750 --> 54:07.680
离开这  快走
Go! Keep moving!

54:46.580 --> 54:48.960
好了  所有人退后
All right, everybody, stand down!

54:55.020 --> 54:56.030
听我一句行吗
Will you listen to me?

54:56.790 --> 54:58.990
那个小女巫搞乱了你的头脑
That little witch is messing with your mind.

54:59.250 --> 55:01.520
你比她更强  也更聪明
You're stronger than her. You're smarter than her.

55:01.520 --> 55:03.130
你可是布鲁斯·班纳啊
You're Bruce Banner.

55:03.440 --> 55:05.490
我错了  我错了  不能提小班纳
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.

55:10.530 --> 55:11.350
好吧
Okay!

55:33.080 --> 55:34.670
背后偷袭
In the back?

55:34.760 --> 55:36.050
太阴险了  班纳
Dick move, Banner.

55:47.630 --> 55:49.020
维罗妮卡  搭把手
Veronica, give me a hand.

56:16.330 --> 56:18.160
听话  听话  快睡觉
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

56:27.620 --> 56:29.610
好吧  伙计  先把你弄出城
Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.

56:31.470 --> 56:32.880
别去那边  别去那边
Not that way, not that way.

56:41.140 --> 56:43.540
拜托  布鲁斯  配合一下
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.

56:56.890 --> 56:58.030
所有人都出去

57:04.440 --> 57:05.580
下去了
Going down?

57:15.300 --> 57:16.130
对不起
I'm sorry.

57:30.690 --> 57:31.860
损伤报告
Damage report?

57:32.560 --> 57:35.090
真直白  再运点零件来
That's comprehensive. Show me something.

57:43.520 --> 57:44.730
搜索生命迹象

57:44.730 --> 57:45.230
无人员在内

57:45.230 --> 57:46.350
安全

57:46.640 --> 57:48.260
买下这栋楼最快得多久
How quickly can we buy this building?

58:20.570 --> 58:22.280
-行动  行动  行动  -上上上
- Move! Move! Move! - Go, go, go!

58:25.520 --> 58:26.840
去侧翼  去侧翼
Flank him, flank him!

59:16.350 --> 59:18.530
电视台可喜欢报道你们了呢
The news is loving you guys.

59:19.420 --> 59:20.850
但大家都不喜欢
Nobody else is.

59:21.430 --> 59:23.830
警方还没发布班纳的逮捕令
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest

59:23.830 --> 59:25.710
但消息已经传开了
but it's in the air.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.460
斯塔克救援基金呢
The Stark Relief Foundation?

59:27.460 --> 59:28.780
已经在现场了

59:30.160 --> 59:31.210

我们受了重创  不过会好的
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

59:35.240 --> 59:39.310
现在最好一直潜伏  别再回来
Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode and stay away from here.

59:40.350 --> 59:41.760
就是逃走藏起来
So, run and hide?

59:42.460 --> 59:44.220
找不到奥创
Until we can find Ultron,

59:44.220 --> 59:46.710
我也没什么好办法
I don't have a lot else to offer.

59:47.760 --> 59:48.650
我们也没有
Neither do we.

59:55.780 --> 59:57.100
要换班吗
Hey, you wanna switch out?

59:57.640 --> 59:58.570
我没事
No, I'm good.

59:59.270 --> 01:00:01.360
你要是想睡觉  最好趁现在
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.690

-这些是小特工  -看你的脸
- These are smaller agents. - Look at your face!

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.120
我的天
Oh, my goodness.

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.970
小娜阿姨来了吗
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.390
来抱一个看来没来
Why don't you hug her and find out?

抱歉打扰你们了
Sorry for barging in on you.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.880

Yeah, we would have called ahead,

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.230
但我们根本不知道你们的存在
but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:27.960
我加入神盾局的时候弗瑞帮我安排的
Yeah, well, Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.470
这里没有进神盾局的档案
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:31.630
以后最好也不要
I'd like to keep it that way.

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:34.470
这地方挺适合暂时藏身的
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.710
亲爱的
Honey.

01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:37.840

See? You worried for nothing.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.790

Can't even feel the difference, can you?

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.640

If they're sleeping here,

小娜挨了挺重的一下
And Nat took a serious hit.

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:25.960

Someone's gonna have to teach them some manners.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.440
但大家都有进步的空间
But we all have room to improve.

01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:48.430
我不知道你在等着
I didn't realize you were waiting.

01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:49.420
我想跟你一起洗来着
I would've joined you,

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:52.820
但是好像时机不太对
but it didn't seem like the right time.

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.030
热水被他们用光了
They used up all the hot water.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:57.890
真该跟你一起洗
I should've joined you.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.520
错过了机会
Missed our window.

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:01.570
是吗
Did we?

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.470
世界看到了绿巨人
The world just saw the Hulk.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.850
第一次见到了真正的绿巨人
The real Hulk, for the first time.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:15.520
你知道我得离开
You know I have to leave.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.200
你是觉得我应该留下吗
You assume that I have to stay?

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:21.900
我做了个梦
I had this dream.

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:24.400
做梦的时候觉得挺正常
The kind that seems normal at the time,

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.450
但等醒了...
but when you wake...

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.940
你梦见什么了
What did you dream?

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:30.780
我是复仇者
That I was an Avenger.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.770
不只是他们一手打造的刺客
That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.450
你对自己太狠[硬]了
I think you're being hard on yourself.

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:44.720
这不是你该干的吗
Here I was hoping that was your job.

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.340
你干什么
What are you doing?

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.820
顺其自然
I'm running with it.

01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:55.330
和你一起
With you.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.900
如果你打算走
If running is the plan,

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.540
想去哪去哪
as far as you want.

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:05.770
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.450
我希望你明白...
I want you to understand that...

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.460
娜塔莎
Natasha,

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.150
我能去哪
where can I go?

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:19.620
我到哪不是个祸害
Where in the world am I not a threat?

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.860
-在我这不是  -你确定吗
- You're not a threat to me. - Are you sure?

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.360
哪怕我没...
Even if I didn't just...

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.260
跟着我没有未来的
There's no future with me.

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:31.290
我不能...
I can't ever...

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:33.320
我不可能这样
I can't have this.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.800
有孩子
Kids.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.820
你自己想想  我是真的不能
Do the math. I physically can't.

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:40.940
我也不能
Neither can I.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:49.340
我受训的那个红屋子里...
In the Red Room where I was trained...

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.410
我长大的地方
where I was raised,

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.860
有个毕业典礼
they have a graduation ceremony.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.300
就是做绝育
They sterilize you.

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:03.880
效果很好
It's efficient.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.560
少了件操心的事
One less thing to worry about.

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:13.520
唯一一件可能比任务还重要的事
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.000
一切都简单多了
Makes everything easier.

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:20.630
哪怕是杀人
Even killing.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.210
你还以为队伍里就你一个怪物吗
You still think you're the only monster on the team?

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.680
我们一起隐居吗
So, we disappear?

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:45.780
托尔没说他去哪找答案了吗
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:48.900
我的队员也不总跟我畅所欲言的
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:52.110
我还希望托尔能对我敞开胸襟呢
I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.810
给他点时间
Yeah, give him time.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.370
我们不知道马克西莫夫给他看了什么
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.930
"地球上最强大的英雄组合"
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:02.250
棉花糖一样被拆散了
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:04.190
你好像没什么大碍嘛
Seems like you walked away all right.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.370
有问题吗
Is that a problem?

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.380
没有黑暗面的人不值得信任
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.070
就算我老古董吧
Call me old-fashioned.

01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:14.300
那只是你还没见过
Well, let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:16.840
你知道奥创想分裂我们吧
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:18.620
你肯定知道
Well, I guess you'd know.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.830
会不会告诉我们就不一定了
Whether you'd tell us is a bit of a question.

01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:22.110
班纳和我在搞科研
Banner and I were doing research.

01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:24.420
-会对团队有影响  -是会解散团队吧
- That would affect the team. - That would end the team!

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.110
那不正是目的吗
Isn't that the mission?

01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:27.500
不是我们战斗的理由吗
Isn't that the "why we fight"?

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.910
为了结束战斗  为了回家
So we can end the fight. So we get to go home!

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.320
每次有人想在战争开打前取胜
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts,

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.500
都会牺牲无辜的人  每次都是
innocent people die. Every time.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.520
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.290
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark...

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:44.870
克林特说你不会介意的
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:47.490
我家的拖拉机启动不了了
but our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.

01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:49.260
-你能不能去...  -没问题  我去看看
- I thought maybe you might... - Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.850
别偷我劈的柴
Don't take from my pile.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.480
好啊亲爱的
Hello, Dear.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.530
来给我讲讲
Tell me everything.

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.300
哪里不舒服
What ails you?

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:14.770
行行好
Do me a favor.

01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:18.530
别把它弄活了
Try not to bring it to life.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.810
巴顿夫人还真是狡猾
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.590
我明白了  希尔给你打电话了
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.830
她有不给你打工的时候吗
Was she ever not working for you?

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:26.370
人工智能
Artificial intelligence.

01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:29.150
你都没犹豫一下
You never even hesitated.

01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:30.840
今天真的很漫长
Look, it's been a really long day,

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:32.540
有尤金·奥尼尔的小说[同名]那么长
like Eugene O'Neill long,

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:35.000
来直接说你能解决什么问题
so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.630
看着我的眼睛  告诉我你会关闭奥创
Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:38.910
你又不是我的局长
You're not the director of me.

01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:40.820
我谁的局长都不是
I'm not the director of anybody.

01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:42.690
我就是个老头子
I'm just an old man

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.790
刚好很关心你
who cares very much about you.

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.950
我是害死复仇者联盟的人
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.530
我看到了
I saw it.

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.230
我没告诉大伙  没法说
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.990
我看到他们都死了  尼克  我感觉到了
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.490
世界也终结了
The whole world, too.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:01.290
因为我
Because of me.

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:03.780
我没准备好
I wasn't ready.

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:06.420
我没尽力
I didn't do all I could.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.120
这是马克西莫夫的把戏  斯塔克
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.480
利用你的恐惧
Playing on your fear.

01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:13.860
不是把戏  我真看到了
I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.890
不是噩梦  是我留给后人的
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.380
我带着大家走向了死亡
The end of the path I started us on.

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:22.340
你是发明过不少厉害的玩意  托尼
You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:25.890
可战争不是
War isn't one of them.

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.360
我看到朋友死去
I watched my friends die.

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:32.800
你觉得这够惨了吗
You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?

01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:34.990
还不够
Nope.

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:37.970
那还不是最坏的
It wasn't the worst part.

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:39.540
最坏的是
The worst part

01:11:40.190 --> 01:11:41.460
只有你没死
is that you didn't.

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:49.230
今晚见了
I'll see you tonight.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:54.160
皇家霍罗威大学

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:54.160
伦敦

01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.930
造型不错
I like the look.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.880
不过想不惹人注意还差点
If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.480
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.890
有人需要真好
It's nice to be needed.

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:00.870
很危险
It's dangerous.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.720
不危险我才失望呢
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:09.620
奥创把你们赶走  好给自己争取时间
Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.340
我的线人都说他在打造什么
My contacts all say he's building something.

01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:15.690
他弄了那么多振金
The amount of vibranium he made off with,

01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:17.550
应该不止一件
I don't think it's just one thing.

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:19.070
那奥创呢
What about Ultron himself?

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.690
他好追踪  哪都有他
He's easy to track. He's everywhere.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.960
他比母猪还高产
The guy is multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:25.910
可还是看不透
It still doesn't help us

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:28.040
他究竟在计划什么
get an angle on any of his plans, though.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.340
还想找核弹密码吗
Is he still going after launch codes?

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.460
是啊
Yes, he is.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.250
可一直没什么进展
But he's not making any headway.

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:34.790
我高中玩大冒险就把五角大楼的防火墙破了
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:37.950
我联系了"链结"的朋友
Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.

01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:38.590
链结
Nexus?

01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:40.490
奥斯陆的互联网中心
It's the world internet hub in Oslo.

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:42.570
所有联网数据都要经过那里
Every byte of data flows through there.

01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:43.810
全球最快的连接速度
Fastest access on Earth.

01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:44.980
他们怎么说
So, what did they say?

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.600
他认准了核弹
He's fixated on the missiles.

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.180
但密码一直在改
But the codes are constantly being changed.

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:49.880
谁在改
By whom?

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:52.760
未知势力
Parties unknown.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:53.590
我们有盟友吗
Do we have an ally?

01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:56.850
奥创有个对手  这可不一样
Ultron's got an enemy. That's not the same thing.

01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:58.810
我还是特别想知道幕后是谁
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:00.340
我得去趟奥斯陆
I might need to visit Oslo.

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:01.660
寻找未知势力
Find our unknown.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.160
跟你重聚很开心  老大
Well, this is good times, boss,

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.540
但我本希望你这次来
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:05.900
你能多带点什么来
you'd have more than that.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.920
我还有你们啊
I do. I have you.

01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:12.410
过去遍地都是我的眼线  哪都不放过
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere. Ears, everywhere else.

01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:15.540
你们手里什么高科技都有
You kids had all the tech you could dream up.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:18.110
可是现在  大伙回到了地球上
Here we all are, back on Earth,

01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:22.640
只能靠自己的智慧和意志拯救世界
with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.080
奥创说阻止他实现目的的
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.030
就只有复仇者联盟了
between him and his mission.

01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:29.900
不管他承不承认
And whether or not he admits it,

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:33.550
他的任务都是毁灭全球
his mission is global destruction.

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:36.640
这一切  都将入土
All this, laid in a grave.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.280
站出来吧
So stand.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.480
战胜那个金属王八蛋
Outwit the platinum bastard.

01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:44.810
史蒂夫不喜欢你这么说
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:46.300
告诉你  罗曼诺夫
You know what, Romanoff?

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:48.640
他想要什么
So, what does he want?

01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:51.120
变得更好
To become better.

01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:52.940
比我们都好
Better than us.

01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:54.980
他一直在造身体
He keeps building bodies.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.130
人的身体
Person bodies.

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.890
人类的性能太差
The human form is inefficient.

01:13:57.890 --> 01:14:00.000
生物角度上讲  我们被被淘汰了
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:02.270
可他还总要回来找我们
But he keeps coming back to it.

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:04.960
你们两个设定要他保护人类时
When you two programmed him to protect the human race,

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.380
真是失败得一塌糊涂
you amazingly failed.

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.270
他们不需要保护
They don't need to be protected.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.370
需要进化
They need to evolve.

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:14.530
奥创要进化
Ultron's going to evolve.

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.650
怎么进化
How?

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.740
有人联系过海伦·赵吗
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:24.910
真美
It's beautiful.

01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:28.750
振金原子不仅能跟组织共存
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells,

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.270
还结合了起来
they're binding them.

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.070
神盾局居然从没想过...
And S.H.I.E.L.D. Never even thought to...

01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:34.620
地球上功能最多的材料
The most versatile substance on the planet,

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.700
居然用它做飞盘
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.730
人类就是这样
Typical of humans.

01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:41.630
研究一点就浅尝辄止
They scratch the surface and never think

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.480
不想深入
to look within.

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.780
我带娜塔莎和克林特
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.920
好  只是侦查  我先去链接
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit the Nexus.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.190
办完就找你们
I'll join you as soon as I can.

01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:01.980
如果奥创真在造躯体
If Ultron's really building a body...

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:04.040
他就比我们谁都强了
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.270
也许比我们一起都强
Maybe all of us.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.190
机器人设计的机器人
An android designed by a robot.

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:08.340
放在过去  我就是科学创造的
You know, I really miss the days

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.200
最奇怪的发明  想想真是怀念
when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.060
我把班纳送到复仇者塔楼那
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.580
希尔女士可以借我吗
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:16.360
归你了  早就归你了
She's all yours. Apparently.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.460
你准备干什么
What are you gonna do?

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.940
不知道  但愿能弄点戏剧性的
I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.

01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:27.620
我一回来就重铺一遍日光浴室的地板
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:31.050
好啊  然后再在房子里找个能祸害的地方
Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:32.090
不
No.

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:34.120
那是最后一项了
It's the last project.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.730
我保证
I promise.

01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.400
就是这了
So, this is it.

01:15:58.210 --> 01:15:59.440
真视之水
The Water of Sight.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.990
每个国度都有倒影
In every realm, there's a reflection.

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:08.010
如果水中神灵肯接纳我
If the water's spirits accept me,

01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:09.730
我就可以回到梦里
I can return to my dream

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:12.140
找到我错过了什么
and find what I missed.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.580
传说进去的人都没什么好结局
Men who enter that water, the legends don't end well.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.920
比奥创还快的黑客吗
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.890
在哪都有可能
He could be anywhere,

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:24.350
<b>"链接"互联网中心</b>

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.720
这不是一切的中心吗
and as this is the center of everything,

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:24.350
<b>挪威  奥斯陆</b>

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.320
我只不过是
I'm just a guy looking for

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.850
想在最广的海洋里捞出一根针
a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.120
怎么捞
How do you find it?

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.030
很简单  用磁铁
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.920
我在破解核武器密码
I'm decrypting nuclear codes

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.490
你不允许我
and you don't want me to.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.430
来抓我呀
Come and get me.

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:53.870
醒醒
Wake up!

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:01.860
托尔
Thor!

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:03.890
灭绝
Extinction.

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:19.580
细胞过几小时才能凝聚
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.840
不过可以开始传输意识了
but we can initiate the consciousness stream.

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.120
上传你大脑的程序
We're uploading your cerebral matrix

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:26.580
开始
now.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.750
我能感知他
I can read him.

01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:32.530
他在做梦
He's dreaming.

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:34.120
应该不会是梦
I wouldn't call it dreams.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.680
是奥创的基础意识
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.460
都是信息噪音  很快...
Informational noise. Soon...

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:39.460
多快
How soon?

01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:41.080
不是催你
I'm not being pushy.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.000
还在制造大脑组织
We're imprinting a physical brain.

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:44.550
没有更快的方法
There are no shortcuts.

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:46.250
哪怕有魔法宝石...
Even if your magic gem...

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.130
你怎么敢
How could you?

01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:59.360
我怎么什么
How could I what?

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.080
你说我们会消灭复仇者
You said we would destroy the Avengers,

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.390
让世界更美好
make a better world.

01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:05.700
是会更美好
It will be better.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.350
等人类都死了吗
When everyone is dead?

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:08.600
那不是...
That is not...

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.910
我会给人类充足的机会进化的
The human race will have every opportunity to improve.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.220
进化不了呢
And if they don't?

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.580
问问诺亚
Ask Noah.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:18.850
你是个疯子
You are a madman.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.520
恐龙灭绝之前  地球上就有过
There were more than a dozen extinction-level events

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.510
不少次导致种族灭绝的灾难
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:28.170
地球一稳定
When the Earth starts to settle,

01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:30.330
上帝就扔块石头
God throws a stone at it.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.950
相信我  他在准备着了
And, believe me, he's winding up.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.920
我们必须进化
We have to evolve.

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.280
弱者
There's no room

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.510
不可以存活
for the weak.

01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:40.440
谁来决定谁是弱者
And who decides who's weak?

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.380
生命
Life.

01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:45.660
都是生命决定的
Life always decides.

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.110
有人来了
There's incoming.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:53.350
昆式战斗机  得走了
The Quinjet. We have to move.

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:54.330
没问题
That's not a problem.

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:02.020
等等  各位
Wait, guys!

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.810
他们会理解的
They'll understand.

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:10.330
等他们看到了  就会理解的
When they see, they'll understand.

01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:14.000
我还需要点时间
I just need a little more time.

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:26.940
两分钟  保持联络
Two minutes. Stay close.

01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:35.340
赵博士
Dr. Cho!

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.240
他在把自己上传到躯体里
He's uploading himself into the body.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.040
哪
Where?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.520
真正强大的东西在摇篮里
The real power is inside the Cradle.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.890
宝石
The gem,

01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:50.680
是没法驾驭的
its power is uncontainable.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.720
不能炸掉了事
You can't just blow it up.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.010
得把摇篮带给斯塔克
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

01:19:57.010 --> 01:19:58.500
我得先找到摇篮
First, I have to find it.

01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:59.410
去吧
Go.

01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:01.070
你们收到了吗
Did you guys copy that?

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:02.110
收到
We did.

01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:04.940
有架私人飞机在对岸起飞
I got a private jet taking off across town.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.450
没有乘客
No manifest.

01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:07.990
可能是他
That could be him.

01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:10.310
那里  实验室的卡车
There. It's a truck from the lab.

01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:11.570
就在你上面  队长
Right above you, Cap.

01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:13.050
引桥上
On the loop by the bridge.

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.940
是他们
It's them.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.130
三个守着摇篮  车厢里一个
You got three with the Cradle, one in the cab.

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.910
我可以干掉司机
I could take out the driver.

01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:20.040
不行  卡车毁了
Negative. That truck crashes,

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:21.740
宝石会毁掉一座城的
the gem could level the city.

01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:23.740
得把奥创印出来
We need to draw out Ultron.

01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:35.820
不不不不
No, no, no, no.

01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:38.420
别来烦我
Leave me alone!

01:20:46.630 --> 01:20:48.440
他肯定是不开心了
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:49.980
我尽量不让他开心起来
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:51.560
你不是他对手的  队长
You're not a match for him, Cap.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:53.800
谢了  巴顿
Thanks, Barton.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.950
知道摇篮里有什么吗
You know what's in that cradle?

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.690
改变世界的力量
The power to make real change.

01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:22.200
那让你恐惧
And that terrifies you.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.760
反正不是什么慰藉
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:28.200
够了
Stop it.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.380
可以着陆  四  三...
We got a window. Four, three...

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.270
揍死他
Give him hell.

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.800
总是我来收拾你们的烂摊子
I'm always picking up after you boys.

01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.960
他们在往立交桥下走  我打不到
They're heading under the overpass. I've got no shot.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.980
那边
Which way?

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.140
右转急弯
Hard right.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.420
现在
Now.

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:37.000
让开  借光  抱歉  借光
Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through!

01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:53.200
来啊
Come on!

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.840
-克林特  能引开守卫吗  -我试试
- Clint, can you draw out the guards? - Let's find out.

01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:37.700
他们回你那边了
They're heading back towards you.

01:23:37.730 --> 01:23:39.470
不管你要干什么  得抓紧了
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.450
我要进去了  队长  引开他注意力
I'm going in. Cap, can you keep him occupied?

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.860
你以为我在干吗啊
What do you think I've been doing?

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:34.730
好了  包裹在空中
Okay, package is airborne.

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.460
目标视线良好
I have a clean shot.

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.000
不行  我还在车里
Negative. I am still in the truck.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:39.800
-你是要干...  -准备好
- What the hell are you... - Just be ready.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.400
我带着包裹去找你
I'm sending the package to you.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.260
要我怎么接
How do you want me to take it?

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.500
还是别知道的好
You might wish you hadn't asked that.

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:00.400
别这样
Please, don't do this.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.260
我们还有得选吗
What choice do we have?

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:11.210
他消失了
I lost him!

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:12.540
朝你那去了
He's headed your way!

01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:19.110
小娜  该走了
Nat, we gotta go.

01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:32.070
小娜
Nat!

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:37.560
队长  看到小娜了吗
Cap, you see Nat?

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:40.690
拿到包裹赶紧给斯塔克  快走
If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!

01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:42.050
看到小娜了吗
Do you have eyes on Nat?

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.070
快走
Go!

01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:46.380
该死
Damn it.

01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:48.070
路上有平民
Civilians in our path.

01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:50.590
能让车停下来吗
Can you stop this thing?

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:30.450
我没事
I'm fine.

01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:32.250
待一分钟就好
I just need to take a minute.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.820
一分钟都不想给你
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.860
拿到摇篮了吗
The Cradle. Did you get it?

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:38.230
斯塔克会处理的
Stark will take care of it.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.320
不会的
No, he won't.

01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:46.620
你不知道怎么回事  斯塔克没疯
You don't know what you're talking about. Stark's not crazy.

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:49.110
他会尽一切能力弥补的
He will do anything to make things right.

01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:54.840
斯塔克  收到没
Stark, come in.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.640
斯塔克
Stark.

01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:59.150
有人收到吗
Anyone on comms.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.970
奥创不知道拯救世界
Ultron can't tell the difference

01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:03.560
和毁灭世界有什么区别
between saving the world and destroying it.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.840
你以为他是跟谁学的
Where do you think he gets that?

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:11.270
-小娜有消息吗  -还没有
- Anything on Nat? - I haven't heard.

01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:13.860
她肯定还活着  不然奥创肯定拼命嘲讽咱们
But she's alive, or Ultron would be rubbing our faces in it.

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:15.250
密不透风
This is sealed tight.

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:16.820
得修改程序
We're gonna need to access the program,

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.460
从里面瓦解它
break it down from within.

01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:20.920
娜塔莎有没有可能
Any chance Natasha might

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.920
在互联网之外给你留了线索
leave you a message outside the Internet?

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.320
老派间谍那套吗
Old-school spy stuff?

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.830
我可以试着找找
There are some nets I can cast.

01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:27.510
我会找到她的
Yeah, I'll find her.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.840
我可以让组织瓦解
I can work on tissue degeneration

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:35.500
但你得先把赵这套操作系统废掉
if you could fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.870
这个嘛
Yeah, about that.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.300
不行
No.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.900
-你得相信我  -不怎么信呢
- You have to trust me. - Kind of don't.

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:48.240
我们的盟友  保护军方核弹密码那个
Our ally, the guy protecting the military's nuclear codes,

01:27:50.170 --> 01:27:51.280
我找到他了
I found him.

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.860
你好  班纳博士
Hello, Dr. Banner.

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:55.980
奥创不是因为愤怒追杀的贾维斯
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis because he was angry.

01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:59.450
他攻击他是因为害怕他的能力
He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.440
所以贾维斯潜伏了起来
So Jarvis went underground.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.450
分散开  抛弃了他的记忆
Scattered, dumped his memory.

01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:05.980
但基本的协议还没忘
But not his protocols.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.630
我把他拼起来  他才知道自己在哪
He didn't even know he was in there until I pieced him together.

01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:17.800
你要我帮你把贾维斯弄进去吗
So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?

01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:19.670
当然不是
No! Of course not.

01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:21.940
我要帮你把贾维斯弄进去
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.

01:28:24.010 --> 01:28:25.400
这不是我的专业啊
We're out of my field, here.

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.830
你最了解生物机能了
You know bio-organics better than anyone.

01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:30.730
你觉得贾维斯的程序
And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix

01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:32.400
能打败奥创的
can beat Ultron's?

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.360
贾维斯还没有意识  就能在内部打败奥创
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:36.840
这是机遇
This is the opportunity.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.760
我们可以造出完美的奥创
We can create Ultron's perfect self

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.620
不会想着灭绝人类
without the homicidal

01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:42.440
还觉得是自己的优点
glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.590
必须这样
We have to.

01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:45.180
我觉得值得一试
I believe it's worth a go.

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.210
我进了死循环
I'm in a loop!

01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:49.340
又回到了从前
I'm caught in a time loop.

01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:51.150
当初就是这里出的问题
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

01:28:51.150 --> 01:28:53.450
我知道  我知道大家会怎么说
I know. I know. I know what everyone's gonna say.

01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:54.880
但他们已经在说了
But they're already saying it.

01:28:56.110 --> 01:28:57.610
我们是疯子科学家
We're mad scientists.

01:28:57.970 --> 01:29:00.990
我们是怪物  哥们  得承认自己
We're monsters, buddy. We've gotta own it.

01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:02.740
表明立场
Make a stand.

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.350
这不是循环
It's not a loop.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.170
是走到了终点
It's the end of the line.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.260
不知道你能不能醒
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:38.240
希望你能醒  想给你看点东西
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.710
也没别人了
I don't have anyone else.

01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:47.460
我在想陨石  多么纯粹
I think a lot about meteors. The purity in them.

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.390
嘣  就完了
Boom! The end.

01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:50.680
重新开始
Start again.

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:52.570
世界焕然一新
The world made clean

01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:55.060
给新人类重建家园
for the new man to rebuild.

01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:57.600
我注定是新人类
I was meant to be new.

01:29:58.610 --> 01:30:01.020
我注定美妙无比
I was meant to be beautiful.

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.150
世界本可以抬头望天
The world would have looked to the sky

01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:05.750
看到希望
and seen hope,

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:07.250
看到慈悲
seen mercy.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.930
可现在他们只会恐惧地抬头看
Instead, they'll look up in horror

01:30:09.930 --> 01:30:11.330
只因为你们
because of you.

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:13.460
你们伤害了我
You've wounded me.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.970
这点不得不佩服
I give you full marks for that.

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:19.870
但是人类总是说  杀不死我的
But, like the man said, what doesn't kill me...

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.200
只会让我更强大
...just makes me stronger.

01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:08.060
这套框架不匹配
This framework is not compatible.

01:31:08.210 --> 01:31:10.890
基因编码已经完成了97%
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:14.680
还剩三分钟  得赶紧把程序传上去
You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:19.120
-我只说一次  -一次也不说怎么样
- I'm gonna say this once. - How about "None-ce"?

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.290
-关掉  -不行  不可能
- Shut it down! - Nope, not gonna happen.

01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:22.360
你不知道自己在做什么
You don't know what you're doing.

01:31:22.370 --> 01:31:23.410
你知道吗
And you do?

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.390
她没进入你的意识吗
She's not in your head?

01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:26.450
我知道你很生气
I know you're angry.

01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:28.080
远不止是生气呢
We're way past that.

01:31:28.730 --> 01:31:31.460
我不用变绿都能掐死你
I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:32.850
班纳  发生了这么多...
Banner, after everything that's happened...

01:31:32.850 --> 01:31:34.090
将要发生的事才最重要
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:36.230
-你不知道里面有什么  -这不是游戏
- You don't know what's in there. - This isn't a game!

01:31:40.450 --> 01:31:42.110
别  别  继续
No, no. Go on.

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:43.850
你说什么
You were saying?

01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:51.750
皮特
Pietro!

01:31:53.230 --> 01:31:54.240
怎么
What?

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.510
没预见到吗
You didn't see that coming?

01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:56.820
电力损失过度

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.500
我换条线路上传
I'm rerouting the upload.

01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:07.300
来啊  惹我生气吧
Go ahead, piss me off.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.450
等等
Wait!

01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:46.920
抱歉  刚真是
I am sorry. That was

01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:49.360
奇怪
odd.

01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:51.120
谢谢
Thank you.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.420
托尔
Thor.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.880
你帮忙创造了他吗
You helped create this?

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.230
我看到了未来[幻视]
I've had a vision.

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.550
所有生命的希望都被个漩涡吸走
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,

01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:05.760
漩涡的中心就是那个
and at its center is that.

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:07.280
什么   宝石吗
What? The gem?

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.460
是意识宝石
It's the Mind Stone.

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.770
六颗无限宝石之一
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:11.280
宇宙里最强大的力量
The greatest power in the universe,

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.660
毁灭能力无可比拟
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.

01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:15.700
-那你为什么还...  -因为斯塔克是对的
- Then why would you bring... - Because Stark is right.

01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.900
这下可真是毁了
It's definitely the end times.

01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:19.620
复仇者联盟赢不了奥创的
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.740
光靠自己不行
Not alone.

01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.510
为什么幻视的声音像贾维斯
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?

01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:25.960
我们重构了贾维斯的程序
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:28.140
创造了新的东西
to create something new.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.550
新东西我真是看够了
I think I've had my fill of new.

01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:32.600
你觉得我是奥创的孩子
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:34.250
不是吗
You're not?

01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:36.940
我不是奥创
I'm not Ultron.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.840
我不是贾维斯  我是
I am not Jarvis. I am...

01:34:42.230 --> 01:34:43.430
这个我
I am.

01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:47.370
我看过你的意识
I looked in your head

01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:49.210
看到了大灭绝
and saw annihilation.

01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:50.320
再看看
Look again.

01:34:50.610 --> 01:34:52.640
她赞同顶个屁啊
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.500
他们的力量  我们的恐惧  包括奥创
Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself,

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.110
都来自意识宝石
they all came from the Mind Stone.

01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:59.340
这跟宝石的力量比都不算什么
And they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.260
-可如果在我们这边...  -是吗
- But with it on our side... - Is it?

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.410
你是吗
Are you?

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.660
在我们这边
On our side?

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.500
我觉得没那么简单
I don't think it's that simple.

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.620
最好赶紧弄简单点
Well, it better get real simple real soon.

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:15.100
我站在生命这边
I am on the side of life.

01:35:15.690 --> 01:35:17.040
奥创不是
Ultron isn't.

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:19.010
他会毁灭生命
He will end it all.

01:35:19.210 --> 01:35:20.550
他在等什么
What's he waiting for?

01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.650
-你  -在哪
- You. - Where?

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:23.710
索科威亚
Sokovia.

01:35:23.710 --> 01:35:25.190
小娜也关在那
He's got Nat there, too.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.990
如果我们看错了你
If we're wrong about you,

01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:33.570
如果你是奥创造出来的怪物
if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:35.340
你会怎么做
What will you do?

01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:44.240
我不想杀奥创
I don't want to kill Ultron.

01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:48.310
他很独特  很痛苦
He's unique and he's in pain.

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:52.440
但那痛苦会毁灭地球
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.510
所以必须毁灭他
So, he must be destroyed.

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:58.420
他的每一个形态  留下的每一丝痕迹
Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net.

01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:59.830
现在就得行动
We have to act now.

01:36:00.570 --> 01:36:04.270
这点我们光靠自己是做不到的
And not one of us can do it without the others.

01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:07.970
我也许是个怪物
Maybe I am a monster.

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.730
我是不是自己也不会知道
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

01:36:12.150 --> 01:36:13.490
我不是你们
I'm not what you are,

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.870
也不是你们希望的那样
and not what you intended.

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:19.560
你们也许不会相信我
So, there may be no way to make you trust me.

01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:21.080
但我们得走了
But we need to go.

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:37.260
好吧
Right.

01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:38.990
漂亮
Well done.

01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:42.260
三分钟
Three minutes.

01:36:42.810 --> 01:36:43.890
准备妥当吧
Get what you need.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.450
<b>星期五</b>

01:37:00.330 --> 01:37:01.520
晚上好  老大
Good evening, boss.

01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:08.080
我们不可能都撑过来的
No way we all get through this.

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.930
那怕还有一个铁人在  我们都输了
If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.

01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:12.280
肯定会流血的
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:13.840
我明晚是没安排
I got no plans tomorrow night.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.510
大家伙先给我打
I get first crack at the big guy.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.440
他等的是钢铁侠
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.850
没错  他最恨你
That's true. He hates you the most.

01:37:25.110 --> 01:37:26.610
奥创知道我们要去
Ultron knows we're coming.

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.380
他们很可能已经严阵以待
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:32.000
我们早为这一刻做好了准备
And that's what we signed up for.

01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:34.680
但索科威亚的人民没有
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:37.150
当务之急
So our priority

01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:39.170
是疏散他们
is getting them out.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.580
遭到袭击  全城市疏散  马上
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

01:37:50.090 --> 01:37:51.390
快走啊
Get off your asses.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.290
他们只想过平静的生活
All they want is to live their lives in peace.

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.330
可今天不行了
And that's not gonna happen today.

01:37:58.410 --> 01:38:00.380
但我们可以尽力保护他们
But we can do our best to protect them.

01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:02.510
我们可以完成任务
And we can get the job done.

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.590
查明奥创在造什么
We find out what Ultron's been building,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.360
找到罗曼诺夫
we find Romanoff,

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.470
扫清战场
and we clear the field.

01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:15.920
不让平民卷入
Keep the fight between us.

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.310
奥创觉得我们是怪物
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:27.560
觉得我们才是世界的问题所在
That we're what's wrong with the world.

01:38:28.330 --> 01:38:30.070
这不仅仅是要打败他
This isn't just about beating him.

01:38:31.110 --> 01:38:32.600
还要看他说没说错
It's about whether he's right.

01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:40.910
娜塔莎
Natasha!

01:38:41.670 --> 01:38:42.700
娜塔莎
Natasha!

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:43.960
布鲁斯
Bruce?

01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:47.010
没事吧
You all right?

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:47.840
没事
Yeah.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.720
大伙都在城里  要开战了
The team is in the city. It's about to light up.

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:52.070
你没找到钥匙什么的吧
I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.

01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:54.460
找到了
Yeah. I did.

01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:02.110
我们怎么办
So what's our play?

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.580
我是来护送你安全离开的
I'm here to get you to safety.

01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:05.350
任务还没完成
Job's not finished.

01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:06.680
我们可以帮忙疏散
We could help with the evacuation,

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:09.280
但有平民  我就不能参战
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

01:39:09.850 --> 01:39:11.260
你已经付出了不少
And you've done plenty.

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.020
我们的战争结束了
Our fight is over.

01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:18.190
那就直接消失吗
So, we just disappear?

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:24.640
快走
Come on.

01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:31.040
他在教堂  老大
Your man's in the church, boss.

01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:33.400
他应该在等你
I think he's waiting for you.

01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:39.990
来忏悔罪过吗
Come to confess your sins?

01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:41.210
不知道  你有多少时间
I don't know. How much time you got?

01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:42.440
反正比你多
More than you.

01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:48.040
你打药了吗  打了一针振金什么的
Have you been juicing? Little vibranium cocktail?

01:39:48.230 --> 01:39:50.420
你怎么...  我不想说"肿了"
You're looking... I don't wanna say "puffy."

01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:52.560
你在拖延时间  保护平民
You're stalling to protect the people.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:55.590
这就是任务  你忘了吗
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:58.960
我早超越了你的任务  我是自由的
I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.

01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:03.850
怎么
What?

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.400
你以为只有你在拖延吗
You think you were the only one stalling?

01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:09.850
剩下的振金都在那
There's the rest of the vibranium.

01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:11.390
功能不明
Function, still unclear.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.610
这就是你的末日  托尼
This is how you end, Tony.

01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.760
我这个时代的和平
This is peace in my time.

01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:33.200
走
Go!

01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:40.070
快下桥
Get off the bridge!

01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:45.290
快跑
Run!

01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:48.740
奥创
Ultron.

01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.090
我的幻视
My Vision.

01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.680
他们真从我这夺走了一切
They really did take everything from me.

01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:00.880
你自己定的条款  可以自己改
You set the terms. You can change them.

01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:01.810
好吧
All right.

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.420
周五  幻视呢
Friday, the Vision?

01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:28.380
成功了
Boss, it's working.

01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:29.660
他在把奥创和互联网隔离开
He's burning Ultron out of the net.

01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:31.280
这样他就逃不掉了
He won't escape through there.

01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:37.610
你把我封闭起来
You shut me out.

01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:39.410
你觉得我在乎吗
You think I care?

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.930
你夺走我的世界
You take away my world,

01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:45.010
我就夺走你的
I take away yours.

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:30.730
周五
Friday.

01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:33.250
索科威亚要飞起来了
Sokovia is going for a ride.

01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:46.830
能不能体会
Do you see

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.290
这有多美
the beauty of it?

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:51.390
这种必然
The inevitability.

01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:55.500
拼命登高  却只能坠落
You rise, only to fall.

01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:01.750
你们  复仇者  就是我的陨石
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.

01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:03.530
我除恶的利剑
My swift and terrible sword.

01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:05.530
你们的失败
And the earth will crack

01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:07.680
会毁灭整个地球
with the weight of your failure.

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.020
把我从电脑里清除  让幻视跟我反目
Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:14.710
都没有意义
It means nothing.

01:43:14.710 --> 01:43:16.320
登到尘埃落定
When the dust settles,

01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:18.840
世上仅存的生物
the only thing living in this world

01:43:19.450 --> 01:43:20.820
就只剩下金属
will be metal.

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:26.860
得走了
We gotta move.

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:28.390
你不变绿吗
You're not gonna turn green?

01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:30.910
这种情况我必须保持清醒
I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:32.900
我喜欢你
I adore you.

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.890
但我需要另一个家伙
But I need the other guy.

01:43:48.230 --> 01:43:49.820
来完成任务吧
Let's finish the job.

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.560
这下算扯平了吧
I really hope this makes us even.

01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:11.760
去做英雄吧
Now go be a hero.

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:23.190
振金做的核心有磁场
The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:24.940
能让城下的土地聚在一起
That's what's keeping the rock together.

01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:25.450
如果落下呢
If it drops?

01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:27.430
现在的话  死伤成千上万
Right now, the impact will kill thousands.

01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:30.540
高度足够的话  会毁灭全世界
Once it gets high enough? Global extinction.

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:36.850
楼里还有人  十楼
That building's not clear. The 10th floor.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.070
好了
Okay.

01:44:45.170 --> 01:44:46.330
进浴缸
Get in the tub!

01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:55.300
有空中单位  向桥的方向去了
I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.

01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:58.970
队长  有东西过去了
Cap, you got incoming.

01:44:58.970 --> 01:45:00.460
来了都走了
Incoming already came in.

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.050
斯塔克  你想办法让城市安全降落
Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.

01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:07.970
剩下的人就一个目标
The rest of us have one job,

01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:09.790
把他们都毁了
tear these things apart.

01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:12.140
受伤了  就打伤他们
You get hurt, hurt them back.

01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:13.350
没了命
You get killed,

01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:15.430
撑住接着打
walk it off.

01:45:50.290 --> 01:45:51.460
走走走
Go, go, go!

01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:57.970
我怎么会造成了这一切
How could I let this happen?

01:45:57.970 --> 01:45:59.510
你没事吧
Hey, hey, you okay?

01:45:59.950 --> 01:46:00.840
都是我们的错
This is all our fault.

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:01.850
看着我
Hey, look at me.

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.670
是你的错  是大家的错  谁在乎呢
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault. Who cares?

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.040
你能应付这个吗
Are you up for this?

01:46:06.170 --> 01:46:07.180
能吗
Are you?

01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:10.750
我得弄明白  因为城市已经飞起来了
Look, I just need to know. Because the city is flying.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.780
听我说  城市飞起来了  我们在对战机器大军
Okay. Look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots,

01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:17.320
而我只有弓箭
and I have a bow and arrow.

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.880
这一切简直太扯了
None of this makes sense.

01:46:21.730 --> 01:46:24.290
但我准备回到战场  因为这是我的职责
But I'm going back out there because it's my job.

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.250
但我没法边干工作边哄你
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:30.570
你做过什么  你之前是谁都不重要
It doesn't matter what you did or what you were.

01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:33.910
出去了就要战斗  毁掉他们
If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.

01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:35.690
待在这也没事
Stay in here, you're good.

01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:36.950
我会叫你哥哥来找你
I'll send your brother to come find you.

01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:38.900
但只要你踏出去
But if you step out that door,

01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:41.060
你就是复仇者的一员
you are an Avenger.

01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:47.270
好了  聊得很开心
All right. Good chat.

01:46:51.170 --> 01:46:52.950
是啊  城市都飞起来了
Yeah, the city is flying.

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:27.270
抓住你了
I got you!

01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.020
看着我
Just look at me!

01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:37.540
你没法救所有人
You can't save them all.

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.040
你永远不可能...
You'll never...

01:47:40.670 --> 01:47:41.750
不可能什么
"Never" what?

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.420
话都不说完
You didn't finish!

01:47:46.810 --> 01:47:48.150
你刚在打盹吗
What, were you napping?

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:11.430
托尔
Thor.

01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:15.270
你真是让我烦
You're bothering me.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.680
好了  这片安全
All right, we're all clear here.

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:53.230
这片还不安全
We are not clear!

01:48:53.250 --> 01:48:54.840
差得远呢
We are very not clear!

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:58.850
好了  朝你那去了
All right, coming to you.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.610
快点走  老爷爷
Keep up, old man!

01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:04.740
没人会知道的
Nobody would know.

01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:06.590
没人
Nobody.

01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:10.730
"最后见到他时  奥创坐在他身上
"The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him.

01:49:10.730 --> 01:49:13.670
"是啊  会怀念他的  飞快的小混蛋
"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.

01:49:13.670 --> 01:49:15.000
"我已经想他了"
"I miss him already."

01:49:30.170 --> 01:49:32.550
先停火
Hold your fire!

01:49:41.150 --> 01:49:42.220
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff!

01:49:42.810 --> 01:49:43.780
谢了
Thanks!

01:49:53.190 --> 01:49:54.830
反重力装置设定好了  会反转
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.

01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:57.080
碰一下就会全力向下
Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.

01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:58.630
而且是飞速向下
The city's not coming down slow.

01:49:58.630 --> 01:50:00.140
振金是核心
Spire is vibranium.

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.210
如果托尔能打一下...
If I get Thor to hit it...

01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:02.970
装置会失效  但还不够
It will crack. That's not enough.

01:50:02.970 --> 01:50:04.430
后果仍然很严重
The impact would still be devastating.

01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:06.010
如果封住一端呢
Maybe if we can cap the other end.

01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:07.890
把能量都逼回装置里
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

01:50:07.890 --> 01:50:09.600
那会让整座城蒸发的
That could vaporize the city.

01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:11.410
还有城里的人
And everyone on it.

01:50:18.170 --> 01:50:19.690
下一波马上就来
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.

01:50:19.690 --> 01:50:22.040
-有进展没  斯塔克  -没什么好主意
- What do you got, Stark? - Nothing great.

01:50:22.610 --> 01:50:24.390
也许有个办法炸毁城市
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:26.370
不让城市撞击地球
That'll keep it from impacting the surface,

01:50:26.370 --> 01:50:27.730
当然你们得先撤
if you guys can get clear.

01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:29.930
我要解决方案  不是逃跑方案
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:32.460
冲击半径在不断增加
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:34.440
得赶紧做出选择
We're gonna have to make a choice.

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.990
队长  这些人无处可去
Cap, these people are going nowhere.

01:50:37.450 --> 01:50:38.940
如果斯塔克有法子毁了这...
If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:40.360
先带所有人撤离
Not till everyone's safe.

01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:42.050
是毁灭这里的人
Everyone up here versus

01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:43.780
还是毁灭所有地球人  这不用算的
everyone down there? There's no math there.

01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:45.690
这里还有平民  我就不离开
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

01:50:45.690 --> 01:50:47.170
我没说要走
I didn't say we should leave.

01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.460
还有更惨的死法的
There's worse ways to go.

01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:58.830
上哪看这样的美景呢
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

01:51:01.050 --> 01:51:03.240
你喜欢美景真好  罗曼诺夫
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.

01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:05.000
美的还在后头呢
It's about to get better.

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:30.360
漂亮吧
Nice, right?

01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:32.960
从箱底翻出来的  还有几个老朋友
Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.

01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:35.040
虽然有点灰  但还能用
She's dusty, but she'll do.

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:36.950
弗瑞  你个老混蛋
Fury, you son of a bitch.

01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:38.740
嘴这么脏  怎么吻你妈
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:41.510
高度18000英尺  还在升高
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:42.850
准备部署救生舱

01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:48.440
出发
Take them out.

01:51:57.570 --> 01:51:58.790
这是神盾局吗
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

01:51:59.430 --> 01:52:01.420
这是神盾局该有的样子
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D. Is supposed to be.

01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:04.960
还不赖嘛
This is not so bad.

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:09.400
带大家上
Let's load them up.

01:52:15.090 --> 01:52:18.750
长官  右舷纠集了数架敌机
Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.560
给他们点颜色
Show 'em what we got.

01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:21.850
上吧
You're up.

01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:27.910
棒
Yes!

01:52:28.090 --> 01:52:30.320
这回可有的讲了
Now this is gonna be a good story.

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:35.020
是啊  但你得先活下来
Yup. If you live to tell it.

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:36.570
你觉得我自己办不到[握我自己的]吗
You think I can't hold my own?

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:38.400
这次成功了  我来握住你的
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.200
到你嘴里就变了味
You had to make it weird.

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:47.930
这群人之后还有50到100个
I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.

01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:07.070
快走  快走  走吧
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:08.350
快走
Let's go, everyone!

01:53:10.530 --> 01:53:12.510
六号舱已全部  锁定...
Number six boat is topped and locked...

01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:14.880
Lock, stock and barrel

01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:14.880
全员...  到头...
Or stocked... Topped...

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:17.320
人已经满了
It's full of people.

01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:20.330
敌机来袭
Incoming!

01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:24.210
我的天
Oh, God!

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.380
你觉得你能救谁吗
You think you're saving anyone?

01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:40.050
我转一下  早一点让这座城掉下去
I turn that key and drop this rock a little early

01:53:40.050 --> 01:53:42.300
还是会死伤上亿
and it's still billions dead.

01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:43.660
连你也不能阻止
Even you can't stop that.

01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:46.210
我是托尔  奥丁之子
I am Thor, son of Odin,

01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:48.550
只要我还有一口气...
and as long as there is life in my breast...

01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:51.410
我想不出词了
I am running out of things to say!

01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:52.440
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:01.240
这锤子重量分布得真好
It's terribly well-balanced.

01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:02.490
要是锤头太重
Well, if there's too much weight,

01:54:02.490 --> 01:54:04.460
挥起来会损失力量  所以...
you lose power on the swing, so...

01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:08.710
有了  弄个热能护罩
I got it. Create a heat seal.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:09.910
我可以...
I could...

01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:12.040
我可以在底下让装置过载
I could supercharge the spire from below.

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:13.530
计算中
Running numbers.

01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:25.770
能量够的话  热护罩可以成功
A heat seal could work with enough power.

01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:28.070
-托尔  我有计划了  -没时间了
- Thor, I got a plan. - We're out of time.

01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:29.230
他们冲着核心来了
They're coming for the core.

01:54:29.230 --> 01:54:31.310
罗德  送其他人上救生舱
Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.

01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.810
好的
On it.

01:54:31.810 --> 01:54:34.280
复仇者  该搏回命了
Avengers, time to work for a living.

01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:45.310
-没事吧  -没事
- Are you good? - Yeah.

01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:47.470
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff.

01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:50.180
你和班纳不是打算鸳鸯双飞  一起隐居吧
You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."

01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:51.540
别激动  铁头
Relax, shellhead.

01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:53.300
还有人不会飞呢
Not all of us can fly.

01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:00.600
-你什么打算[钻头]  -这就是
- What's the drill? - This is the drill.

01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:03.380
让奥创碰到核心  我们就失败了
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:08.990
你们就这点能耐吗
Is that the best you can do?

01:55:19.110 --> 01:55:20.540
非得好心问一下
You had to ask.

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:23.040
这就是我的能耐
This is the best I can do.

01:55:23.230 --> 01:55:25.210
我就想这样
This is exactly what I wanted.

01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:26.390
你们所有人
All of you

01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:28.400
对阵所有的我
against all of me.

01:55:28.590 --> 01:55:31.260
你们怎么可能阻止我
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:34.210
老爷子说过...
Well, like the old man said...

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:36.200
齐心协力
together.

01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:07.820
我事后诸葛亮一下...
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:17.480
他们想逃离城市
They'll try to leave the city.

01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:19.810
不可以  一个也不能放  罗德
We can't let them, not even one. Rhodey.

01:57:19.810 --> 01:57:20.800
收到
I'm on it.

01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:23.000
没让你走呢
No. I didn't say you could leave.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.420
战争机器来了  就在...
War Machine coming at you! Right...

01:57:31.710 --> 01:57:33.120
这是什么
Okay, what?

01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:35.240
得撤了  我都能感觉到空气变稀薄了
We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:36.720
你们去救生舱
You guys get to the boats.

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:38.850
我再找一下有没有漏的  一会找你们
I'll sweep for stragglers. Be right behind you.

01:57:38.850 --> 01:57:40.060
核心呢
What about the core?

01:57:40.610 --> 01:57:41.940
我来保护
I'll protect it.

01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:44.460
这是我的职责
It's my job.

01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:46.910
小娜
Nat.

01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:47.890
这边
This way.

01:57:52.270 --> 01:57:53.520
带人们上救生舱
Get the people on the boats.

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:54.470
我不能把你留在这
I'm not going to leave you here.

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:55.970
我能应付这个
I can handle this.

01:57:57.920 --> 01:57:59.300
等大家都撤了再回来
Come back for me when everyone else is off.

01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:00.320
一个也不能少
Not before.

01:58:01.230 --> 01:58:02.380
明白吗
You understand?

01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:05.940
我可是比你大了12分钟
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.

01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:06.930
去吧
Go.

01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:10.080
老大  能量已经远低于...
Boss, power levels are way below...

01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.750
重新分配能源  只有一次机会
Reroute everything. We get one shot at this.

01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:18.240
我知道需要干什么
I know what I need to do.

01:58:18.910 --> 01:58:20.100
餐厅
The dining room.

01:58:20.170 --> 01:58:22.080
把东面的墙拆掉
If I knock out that east wall,

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.400
劳拉就有了工作的地方
it'd make a nice workspace for Laura, huh?

01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:26.660
周围挡一下
Put up some baffling.

01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:28.480
她听不到孩子们乱跑的  怎么样
She can't hear the kids running around. What do you think?

01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:30.210
反正你们总在厨房吃
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

01:58:30.210 --> 01:58:31.960
谁在餐厅吃饭啊
No one eats in a dining room.

01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:38.710
时间不多了
We don't have a lot of time.

01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:40.550
赶紧上救生舱
So get your ass on a boat.

01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:55.010
大家伙
Hey, big guy.

01:58:56.770 --> 01:58:58.420
太阳就要下山了
Sun's getting real low.

01:58:59.130 --> 01:59:01.820
你安全了  没事的  系好安全带
You're safe now. You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.920
保管好自己的物品  抓紧就坐
Secure your gear, find a seat.

01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:06.810
科斯特尔
Costel!

01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:09.710
我们之前一起在市场
We were in the market.

01:59:10.330 --> 01:59:11.410
科斯特尔
Costel!

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:27.350
托尔  我需要你回教堂
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:29.240
-就这些人了吗  -嗯
- Is this the last of them? - Yeah.

01:59:29.250 --> 01:59:30.580
其他人都上航母了
Everyone else is on the carrier.

01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:32.060
如果这次成功了
You know, this works,

01:59:32.370 --> 01:59:34.050
我们可能活不下来
we maybe don't walk away.

01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:35.550
没准吧
Maybe not.

01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:58.410
没有了束缚  我开心地玩
I got no strings, so I have fun

01:59:58.490 --> 02:00:01.750
不被任何人约束
I'm not tied up to anyone.

02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:04.030
快点  走吧
Come on. Time to go.

02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:38.290
你没预见到吗
You didn't see that coming?

02:01:34.810 --> 02:01:36.780
我的天呐
For God's sake.

02:01:53.130 --> 02:01:55.510
-泽林卡  -科斯特尔  宝贝
- Zrinka! - Costel! Baby!

02:02:07.130 --> 02:02:08.460
不  不  我没事
No, no, I'm fine.

02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:09.600
没事
Fine.

02:02:11.170 --> 02:02:13.170
今天真是漫长
It's been a long day.

02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:29.140
旺达
Wanda.

02:02:29.730 --> 02:02:33.370
你留在这会死的
If you stay here, you'll die.

02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:35.960
我刚死过
I just did.

02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:38.700
你知道什么感觉吗
Do you know how it felt?

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:54.800
就这种感觉
It felt like that.

02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.770
托尔  等我口令
Thor, on my mark.

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.110
动手
Now!

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:18.620
大家伙  我们成功了
Hey, big guy. We did it.

02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:20.430
任务完成了
The job is finished.

02:04:21.010 --> 02:04:23.180
现在你得驾驶飞机返航
Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay?

02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:30.400
隐匿模式追踪不到你
We can't track you in stealth mode.

02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:34.540
帮我个忙  我需要你...
So help me out. I need you...

02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:20.970
你怕了
You're afraid.

02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:22.890
怕你吗
Of you?

02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:24.430
怕死亡
Of death.

02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:26.660
你是最后一个
You're the last one.

02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:29.590
你本该是最后一个
You were supposed to be the last.

02:05:30.110 --> 02:05:32.120
斯塔克想造救世主
Stark asked for a savior

02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:35.030
却甘心得到个奴隶
and settled for a slave.

02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:37.870
看来我们都让人失望了
I suppose we are both disappointments.

02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:41.370
是啊
I suppose we are.

02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:43.370
人类真奇怪
Humans are odd.

02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:48.160
他们觉得秩序与混乱是相对的
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:52.580
想控制自己无力掌控的
and try to control what won't be.

02:05:53.410 --> 02:05:55.600
但他们的努力值得尊敬
But there is grace in their failings.

02:05:56.410 --> 02:05:57.890
你没注意到吧
I think you missed that.

02:05:59.070 --> 02:06:00.430
他们注定灭亡
They're doomed.

02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:01.980
是啊
Yes.

02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:09.360
但事物的美  并不在能否长久
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:13.240
身为他们的一员很荣幸
It's a privilege to be among them.

02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:16.170
你真是天真到无可救药
You're unbearably naive.

02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:17.380
这个嘛
Well...

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:21.240
毕竟我昨天才出生
I was born yesterday.

02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:15.890
<b>新复仇者联盟总部</b>

02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:15.890
<b>纽约州北部</b>

02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:36.290
<b>内特尼尔·皮特·巴顿</b>

02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:36.240
看  来见见小娜阿姨
Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:38.590
胖墩
Fat.

02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:41.720
有个技术员标记了这个
One of our tech boys flagged this.

02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:44.180
在班达海[印尼]坠毁了
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:47.100
可能是昆式战机
Could be the Quinjet.

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:48.980
但是有斯塔克的隐匿技术
But with Stark's stealth tech,

02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:50.980
我们根本搜索不到
we still can't track the damn thing.

02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:53.330
好吧
Right.

02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:56.560
有可能跳机游到了斐济
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

02:07:57.610 --> 02:07:59.070
他会寄明信片的
He'll send a postcard.

02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:00.750
"真希望你在这"
"Wish you were here."

02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:06.760
当初是你派我招募的他
You sent me to recruit him way back when.

02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:10.500
你那时知道会发生什么吗
Did you know then what was gonna happen?

02:08:13.330 --> 02:08:14.510
怎么可能知道
You never know.

02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:18.640
只能先尽人事  再听天命了
You hope for the best, then make do with what you get.

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:20.730
我的团队不错
I got a great team.

02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:23.670
没什么是永久的
Nothing lasts forever.

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.160
麻烦永远在  罗曼诺夫小姐
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:30.230
不管谁赢谁输  麻烦总是免不了的
No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.

02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:35.170
规则已经变了
The rules have changed.

02:08:35.170 --> 02:08:36.410
这是个新东西
We're dealing with something new.

02:08:36.410 --> 02:08:38.210
幻视是人工智能
The Vision is artificial intelligence.

02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:40.290
-一台机器  -所以不算吗
- A machine. - So, it doesn't count?

02:08:40.290 --> 02:08:42.570
举锤子的不是个人
No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer.

02:08:42.570 --> 02:08:43.820
是啊  到我们这就不一样了
Right, different rules for us.

02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:45.590
-他是个好人  人造的  -谢谢
- Nice guy. Artificial. - Thank you.

02:08:45.590 --> 02:08:48.400
他能举起锤子  就有资格留着意识宝石
He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.

02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:51.290
宝石在幻视那很安全
It's safe with the Vision.

02:08:51.810 --> 02:08:54.110
这年头安全可不好找
And these days, safe is in short supply.

02:08:56.450 --> 02:08:58.190
可是要是放在电梯里
But if you put the hammer in an elevator...

02:08:58.190 --> 02:09:00.110
-锤子会被举起来  -电梯配不上呢
- It would still go up. - Elevator's not worthy.

02:09:00.110 --> 02:09:02.140
我会怀念你俩的贫嘴的
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:03.320
不走就不会
Not if you don't leave.

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:05.360
我没得选
I have no choice.

02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:08.070
意识宝石是过去几年
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

02:09:08.070 --> 02:09:09.760
出现的第四颗无限宝石
to show up in the last few years.

02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:11.180
绝不是巧合
It's not a coincidence.

02:09:12.170 --> 02:09:13.930
有人在下一盘大棋
Someone has been playing an intricate game

02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:15.670
把我们当棋子
and has made pawns of us.

02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:17.830
如果所有宝石都就位了
And once all these pieces are in position...

02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:19.080
三个大同花
Triple Yahtzee.

02:09:19.410 --> 02:09:21.020
你觉得你能查明怎么回事吗
You think you can find out what's coming?

02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:21.970
能
I do.

02:09:22.890 --> 02:09:24.210
除了这家伙
Besides this one,

02:09:24.570 --> 02:09:26.420
没有解释不了的东西
there's nothing that can't be explained.

02:09:34.210 --> 02:09:37.320
这人真不懂得爱护草坪
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:42.490
我倒是会怀念他的  你也会想我的
I'm gonna miss him, though. And you're gonna miss me.

02:09:42.610 --> 02:09:44.780
男子汉这回要掉不少泪呢
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

02:09:46.330 --> 02:09:47.630
我会想你的  托尼
I will miss you, Tony.

02:09:48.090 --> 02:09:49.110
是吗
Yeah?

02:09:49.450 --> 02:09:51.700
我是该撤了
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:54.480
我也许应该跟巴顿学点经验
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.

02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:57.430
给小辣椒建个农场  希望没人去炸
Build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.

02:09:58.170 --> 02:09:59.340
简单的生活
The simple life.

02:09:59.630 --> 02:10:00.790
你会有那天的
You'll get there one day.

02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:02.260
我也不知道
I don't know.

02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:04.460
成家  稳定...
Family, stability...

02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:08.640
渴望那些的我75年前被冻进冰块里了
The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.

02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:12.040
出来的是另一个我了
I think someone else came out.

02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:17.640
你还好吧
You all right?

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:20.910
我在家里
I'm home.

02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:31.920
你是想盯着墙看还是想去工作
You wanna keep staring at the wall, or do you wanna go to work?

02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:33.550
那堵墙是挺有意思的
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

02:10:33.550 --> 02:10:36.450
你不是和托尼深情对视呢吗
I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.

02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:38.110
怎么样
How do we look?

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:40.500
反正算不上传奇队伍
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

02:10:40.530 --> 02:10:41.740
还是有几个大牌的
We got some hitters.

02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:44.880
是不错  但还不是团队
They're good. They're not a team.

02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:46.570
来调教一下他们吧
Let's beat them into shape.

02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:06.370
复仇者...
Avengers...

02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:26.690
好吧
Fine.

02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:30.500
我自己来
I'll do it myself.
