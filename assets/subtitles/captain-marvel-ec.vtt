致敬斯坦·李

02:04.270 --> 02:08.860
<b>哈拉</b>

02:04.520 --> 02:08.860
<b>克里文明首都</b>

02:13.780 --> 02:15.140
你知道现在几点吗
Do you know what time it is?

02:15.490 --> 02:16.570
睡不着
Can't sleep.

02:16.580 --> 02:18.320
有药片治失眠的
There are tabs for that.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.740
没错  但吃了我不就睡着了
Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.500
又做梦了
Dreams again?

02:27.240 --> 02:28.390
想打架吗
Wanna fight?

02:32.550 --> 02:33.150
我滑倒了
I slipped.

02:33.150 --> 02:34.270
是啊  你滑倒了
Right, you slipped

02:34.270 --> 02:36.460
因为我一拳打在了你脸上
as a result of me punching you in the face.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.170
你打到我脸的时候
I was already slipping

02:37.170 --> 02:38.570
我就已经要滑倒了
when you happened to punch me in the face.

02:38.570 --> 02:40.060
这两件事毫不相关
The two events were not related.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.250
跟我说说这个梦
Tell me about this dream.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.280
-有什么新内容吗  -没有
- Anything new? - No.

02:51.210 --> 02:52.710
你必须放下过去
You have to let go of the past.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.000
我不记得我的过去了
I don't remember my past.

02:54.010 --> 02:55.460
这让你产生怀疑
It's causing you doubt,

02:55.650 --> 02:57.590
怀疑让你有弱点
and doubt makes you vulnerable.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.860
控制住
Control it.

03:08.540 --> 03:09.520
如果你再次失控
Lose control again,

03:09.520 --> 03:12.000
就得去找至高智慧密谈了
and you'll have to commune with the Supreme Intelligence.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.080
对于战士而言  情绪是最危险的
There's nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion.

03:18.260 --> 03:20.520
幽默使人分心
Humor is a distraction.

03:22.750 --> 03:23.790
而愤怒
And anger?

03:24.040 --> 03:25.790
愤怒只会帮助你的敌人
Anger only serves the enemy.

03:37.090 --> 03:40.240
距最后一次斯库鲁侵袭已过去了120天
One hundred twenty days since the last Skrull attack.

03:40.610 --> 03:41.820
有人见过
Has anyone ever seen

03:41.830 --> 03:43.900
至高智慧的真面目吗
what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like?

03:43.900 --> 03:48.090
没人能看到至高智慧的真面目
No one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence in its true form.

03:48.820 --> 03:49.970
你知道的
You know that.

03:51.210 --> 03:53.700
我们的潜意识会选择我们所能看到的形象
Our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.120
因此它是神圣的
So it's sacred.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.050
也是私密的
It's personal.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.230
克里人绝对不会泄露这个秘密
No Kree divulges it, ever.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.740
你会看到谁
Who do you see?

04:01.370 --> 04:02.520
-你哥哥吗  -不是
- Your brother? - No.

04:02.520 --> 04:03.880
-父亲  -不是
- Father? - No.

04:03.890 --> 04:06.170
-你以前的指挥官  -弗斯
- Your old commander? - Vers.

04:06.170 --> 04:07.810
你看到的是我  对吧
It's me you see, isn't it?

04:08.770 --> 04:10.230
我知道你想干什么
I see what you're trying to do.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.110
-这招有用吗  -有用
- Is it working? - Yes.

04:12.150 --> 04:13.920
但你别想转移话题
But you won't succeed in changing the subject.

04:13.930 --> 04:16.390
如果你不希望我使用这力量
What is the point of giving me these...

04:16.400 --> 04:18.020
那还何必把它给我
if you don't want me to use them?

04:18.130 --> 04:19.410
我希望你使用这力量
I want you to use them.

04:19.980 --> 04:21.700
至高智慧让我负责
The Supreme Intelligence gave me a responsibility...

04:21.700 --> 04:23.950
教会你如何使用这力量
of showing you how to use them.

04:23.950 --> 04:24.900
我知道怎么用
I know how.

04:24.900 --> 04:25.710
如果你真会用
Yeah, if that were true,

04:25.710 --> 04:27.360
就能不用它也可以打倒我了
you'd be able to knock me down without them.

04:28.650 --> 04:30.600
控制你的冲动
Control your impulses.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.360
不要用这儿  而是用这儿
Stop using this, start using this.

04:35.060 --> 04:39.350
我希望你成为最好的自己
I want you to be the best version of yourself.

04:41.510 --> 04:45.600
<b>至高智慧</b>

04:41.760 --> 04:45.600
<b>克里文明的人工智能领袖</b>

05:20.090 --> 05:21.410
弗斯
Vers.

05:22.380 --> 05:23.720
至高智慧
Intelligence.

05:24.220 --> 05:27.320
你的指挥官坚称你已可以服役
Your commander insists that you're fit to serve.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.660
是的
I am.

05:28.830 --> 05:31.870
你在苦苦纠结你的情绪
You struggle with your emotions...

05:32.430 --> 05:34.840
和你的过去  这助长了它们
with your past, which fuels them.

05:36.430 --> 05:39.570
你只是斯库鲁扩张的受害者之一
You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion...

05:39.570 --> 05:42.840
几世纪以来  他们一直威胁着我们的文明
that has threatened our civilization for centuries.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.930
这些卧底暗中潜入
Imposters who silently infiltrate...

05:45.930 --> 05:48.140
然后占领我们的星球
then take over our planets.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.670
你只记得些许可怕之事
Horrors that you remember...

05:51.670 --> 05:54.550
而大部分已忘却
and so much that you do not.

05:58.090 --> 06:01.430
我的人生一片空白
It's all blank. My life.

06:01.950 --> 06:03.020
你的形象应该是
You're supposed to take the form

06:03.020 --> 06:04.780
我最钦佩的人
of who I most admire...

06:04.900 --> 06:09.440
但我甚至都不记得这人是我的什么人了
but I don't even remember who this person was to me.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.230
或许这样也好
Perhaps this is a mercy

06:11.620 --> 06:13.890
让你免受更多痛苦
sparing you from a deeper pain.

06:14.510 --> 06:17.520
让你放开手脚去做所有克里人该做之事
Freeing you to do what all Kree must...

06:18.470 --> 06:20.790
将人民的需求置于自身之上
Put your people's needs before your own.

06:21.170 --> 06:23.380
我们赐予了你伟大的赠礼
We've given you a great gift.

06:23.390 --> 06:26.720
一个为全体克里人而战的机会
The chance to fight for the good of all Kree.

06:27.660 --> 06:28.820
我想要尽忠
I want to serve.

06:28.820 --> 06:30.610
那就学会自控
Then master yourself.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.200
赐予你的也能收回
What was given can be taken away.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.220
我不会让你失望的
I won't let you down.

06:39.220 --> 06:40.930
我们很快就会见分晓了
We'll know soon enough.

06:42.090 --> 06:43.420
你有一项任务
You have a mission.

06:44.790 --> 06:47.310
尽职尽忠  恪守荣耀
Serve well, and with honor.

07:08.130 --> 07:09.710
一定是出大事了
This can't be good.

07:09.770 --> 07:11.690
肯定又是斯库鲁侵袭
Must be another Skrull attack.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.360
反正是大事
Whatever it is, it's big.

07:14.270 --> 07:15.720
有斯库鲁人模仿过你吗
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

07:15.730 --> 07:16.820
有过一次
Once.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.820
-让我深感不安  -为什么
- It was deeply disturbing. - Why?

07:18.820 --> 07:21.390
因为当我凝视死敌之时
Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy...

07:21.390 --> 07:23.390
看到的却是我自己
and the face staring back was my own.

07:23.390 --> 07:24.690
也许你要是再帅点
Maybe if you were more attractive,

07:24.690 --> 07:26.540
就不会那么不安了
then it would be less disturbing.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.950
你觉得自己很幽默  可我并不觉得好笑
You think you're funny, but I'm not laughing.

07:28.950 --> 07:29.950
你从来不笑
You never laugh.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.470
我只是笑不外露
I laugh on the inside.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.210
我现在并没笑
I'm not doing that now.

07:34.210 --> 07:35.870
说来好笑  因为客观来讲
It's funny 'cause, objectively speaking,

07:35.880 --> 07:36.880
你还挺帅的
you're quite handsome.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.870
多谢

07:37.870 --> 07:39.970
好了  小队  别闹了
Listen up, team. Knock it off.

准备去
Prepare for...

07:45.440 --> 07:48.500
搜救我们的间谍  索拉
a search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.340
斯库鲁人又入侵了一个边境星球
The Skrulls have invaded yet another border planet.

07:51.350 --> 07:53.160
这次是托法
This time, Torfa.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.600
索拉发来了警告
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.950

The signal was intercepted, and his cover's blown.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.390
斯库鲁将军塔罗斯
The Skrull general, Talos,

08:01.390 --> 08:03.600
派了击杀小队去找他
has sent kill units to find him.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.120
如果他们在我们之前找到他
Should they reach him before we do...

08:05.120 --> 08:07.120
那他这三年来收集的情报
the intelligence he's acquired over three years

08:07.120 --> 08:08.680
就等于送给他们了
is as good as theirs.

08:09.430 --> 08:13.160
指控者将轰炸南部这里的一个斯库鲁要塞
The Accusers will bomb a Skrull stronghold here in the south.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.250
我们潜入  找到索拉
We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr...

08:16.690 --> 08:19.450
然后出来  神不知鬼不觉
and we get out, leaving them none the wiser.

08:19.820 --> 08:21.400
托法人
The Torfan populace.

08:22.070 --> 08:23.420
我们不要干扰他们
We are not to interfere with them,

08:23.420 --> 08:24.270
也不要被他们缠住
nor them with us.

08:24.270 --> 08:28.200
我们任务的机密性是第一位的
Nothing compromises the security of our mission.

08:28.210 --> 08:29.940
务必万分小心
Proceed with caution.

08:30.050 --> 08:32.430
撤离他前遵循规程
Follow protocol before extracting him.

08:34.070 --> 08:35.690
此次任务很危险
This is a dangerous mission.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.110
我们要做好加入大集体的准备
We must all be ready to join the Collective

08:38.470 --> 08:40.160
若那是我们今日的命数
if that is our fate today.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.460
为全体克里人而战
For the good of all Kree.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.120

10:16.890 --> 10:18.550
外围有本地人
Locals on the periphery.

10:19.540 --> 10:20.600
可能有十几个
Maybe a dozen.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.960
米涅瓦
Minn-Erva?

10:23.620 --> 10:26.430

Do you read me? Does anybody copy?

10:27.500 --> 10:28.530

His beacon's coming from that temple. Let's move.

10:43.790 --> 10:46.610
不  这里太适合伏击了
No. This is a perfect spot for an ambush.

10:46.810 --> 10:48.300
只有一条路进出
Only one way in, only one way out.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.650
我们可以绕过本地人
We can get past the locals.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.280
我们都不能确定他们是否真是本地人
We don't know if they are locals.

10:51.810 --> 10:52.470
太冒险
Too risky.

10:52.470 --> 10:53.640
你不用跟我一起去  我可以自己去
You don't have to go with me. I'll go alone.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.030
不  不行
No, you won't.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.940

Go back even further.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.490

You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

15:11.690 --> 15:14.230

Who is this person? Are we in the right...?

15:14.230 --> 15:15.590

What the hell are you thinking?

15:15.600 --> 15:16.540
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

15:16.540 --> 15:18.100

You don't belong out here!

15:29.450 --> 15:31.110
你不够强壮
You're not strong enough.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.780
你会害死自己的

你是个好飞行员

15:44.740 --> 15:46.090

But you're too emotional.

15:46.090 --> 15:49.160
你知道那为什么叫驾驶舱[屌坑]吧
You do know why they call it a cockpit, don't you?

15:56.500 --> 15:59.490
一声贯穿宇宙的巨响  震动了月亮
A huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon...

15:59.740 --> 16:01.880
太阳  和天上的星星
and the sun and the stars in the sky.

16:02.760 --> 16:03.590
于是
And so,

16:03.590 --> 16:06.070
小阿露蒂整夜飞上天空

16:23.130 --> 16:24.550

16:24.740 --> 16:26.210
她一般不怎么亲近人的
She doesn't typically take to people.

16:26.210 --> 16:27.660
你起得好早
Early start to your morning.

16:27.700 --> 16:28.880

Late night, actually.

16:28.890 --> 16:30.840
还有工作  我就睡不着
I can't sleep when there's work to do.

16:30.840 --> 16:31.900
耳熟吗
Sound familiar?

16:31.900 --> 16:34.080
我从不觉得飞行是工作
Flying your planes never feels like work.

16:35.530 --> 16:36.830

Wonderful view, isn't it?

16:36.830 --> 16:38.620
我更喜欢上面的风景
I prefer the view from up there.

16:38.650 --> 16:40.090

You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

16:40.090 --> 16:42.450

"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson." That's her.

17:15.930 --> 17:16.810
你也能听到吗
Do you hear that, too?

17:16.820 --> 17:18.420
定位了吗
Do we have her location?

17:20.660 --> 17:21.640
找到了
Got it.

17:21.910 --> 17:25.160
追踪劳森  直到找到能量信号
Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature.

17:29.060 --> 17:30.700

Interesting.

等等
Hold on.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.220
倒回到这之前  回去
Go back right before this. Go back.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.440
那可不是米格  劳森
That's no MiG, Lawson.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.750

This is it. Now let me see where you're headed.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.430

17:57.490 --> 17:58.640
集中精神
Focus!

18:00.480 --> 18:02.790
把她拉回来  快点
Get her back! Get her back now!

18:06.700 --> 18:08.450
这没道理
This doesn't make any sense.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.880
我们拿到任何可以行动的情报了吗
Do we have any information we can act on?

18:26.880 --> 18:29.970
只知道劳森在C53星球上某处
Just that Lawson was somewhere on planet C-53.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.250
我们这就去
We're on our way.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.570
那就再继续深挖
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

18:34.040 --> 18:37.060
劳森能带我们找到光速引擎
Lawson is our link to that light-speed engine!

18:38.710 --> 18:40.550
和我们想要的一切
And everything we're after.

18:49.660 --> 18:50.910

18:51.130 --> 18:52.410
再来
Try that again.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.340
不行
Not yet!

19:14.720 --> 19:16.070
你对我做了什么
What did you do to me?

19:16.820 --> 19:18.610
我们只是想要点情报
Now we're just after a little information.

19:18.610 --> 19:20.300
你往我脑袋里放了什么
What did you put in my head?

19:20.350 --> 19:22.120
那都是本就存在的
Nothing that wasn't already there.

19:23.740 --> 19:25.330
但那些不是我的记忆
But those aren't my memories.

19:25.340 --> 19:27.930
是啊  就像嗑错了药  是吧
Yeah, it's like a bad trip, isn't it?

19:27.930 --> 19:30.670
怪不得你稀里糊涂的
I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.510
他们真把你祸害得不轻
They really did a number on you.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.760
少跟我玩心理战
Enough of your mind games.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.570

We're looking for the location of a Dr. Lawson...

19:39.980 --> 19:41.700
和她的光速引擎
and her light-speed engine.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.360
我不认识什么劳森博士
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

19:43.370 --> 19:46.720
是吗  那她为什么在你脑袋里
Really? Then why is she in your head?

20:18.120 --> 20:18.950
你们不会刚好知道
You guys wouldn't happen to know

20:18.950 --> 20:20.670

how these things come off, would ya?

20:21.050 --> 20:21.960

It wasn't Soh-Larr.

26:08.620 --> 26:11.100

26:13.370 --> 26:15.350

48:24.310 --> 48:26.500
这不是为了作战
This isn't about fighting wars.

48:26.910 --> 48:28.580
而是为了结束战争
It's about ending them.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.970
我知道劳森是克里人
I know Lawson was Kree.

48:35.970 --> 48:38.970
她就在C53星球上  而且死于坠机
She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash.

48:39.230 --> 48:41.000
你对此知情吗
Do you know anything about this?

48:41.790 --> 48:44.980
我刚发现了一份C53发来的任务报告
I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53.

48:45.230 --> 48:48.850
我有权告诉你的不多  弗斯  但是
There's only so much I'm cleared to tell you, Vers, but...

48:52.670 --> 48:56.760
劳森是一名卧底克里特工  名叫玛威尔
Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.270
她在研究一种独特的能量核
She was working on a unique energy core.

49:00.760 --> 49:03.040
实验一种据说可以
Experimenting with tech that apparently

49:03.960 --> 49:05.700
助我们赢下战争的科技
could help us win the war.

49:12.080 --> 49:13.200
她还在吗
She still here?

49:13.210 --> 49:15.540
她在配合调查  长官
She's cooperating with the investigation, sir.

49:15.920 --> 49:17.880
-你们留下  -是  长官
- You men stay here. - Yes, sir.

49:17.880 --> 49:19.550
我要单独审讯她
I want to question her alone.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.540
干得漂亮  尼古拉斯
Excellent work, Nicholas.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.080
上面提到我了吗
Does it say anything about me?

49:29.080 --> 49:31.330
提到你  当然没有
Anything about you? No, of course not.

49:31.330 --> 49:32.430
怎么会呢
Why would it?

49:32.650 --> 49:35.610
我找到证据  表明我曾在这里生活
I found evidence that I had a life here.

49:35.870 --> 49:37.290
在C53上吗
On C-53?

49:39.850 --> 49:42.880
我去见至高智慧时  看到的就是玛威尔
Mar-Vell is who I see when I visit the Supreme Intelligence.

49:42.890 --> 49:46.300
我认识她  我认识身为劳森的她
I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.620
这更像是斯库鲁人的模仿  弗斯
This sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers.

49:48.620 --> 49:50.600
不  不是  因为我记得  我来过这里
No, it's not. Because I remember. I was here.

49:50.610 --> 49:52.470
停下  记住你的训练
Stop. Remember your training.

49:52.470 --> 49:54.580
了解你的敌人  你也可能是你的敌人
Know your enemy. It could be you.

49:54.580 --> 49:58.180
别被情绪影响了你的判断力
Do not let your emotions override your judgment.

49:59.430 --> 50:01.340
她在地下六层
She's on sublevel six.

50:01.340 --> 50:02.580
我在五层下
I'll get off on five...

50:02.580 --> 50:04.910
走楼梯  以防她企图逃跑
and take the stairs in case she makes a run for it.

50:06.120 --> 50:09.500
像我们在哈瓦那时那样  两面夹击
Do a pincer move like we did in Havana.

50:09.500 --> 50:10.490
对
Right.

50:11.320 --> 50:12.790
就像在哈瓦那时那样
Like we did in Havana.

50:23.170 --> 50:24.460
我们快到跳跃点了
We're nearing the jump point.

50:24.460 --> 50:26.530
别关信标  让我们能找到你
Leave your beacon on so I can find you.

50:26.790 --> 50:28.600
我们会查清真相的  弗斯
We'll get to the bottom of this, Vers.

50:29.300 --> 50:30.320
我们一起
Together.

50:33.380 --> 50:34.400
好
Okay.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.530
弗斯
Vers!

50:55.600 --> 50:56.640
弗斯
Vers!

51:13.890 --> 51:15.680
弗瑞在与目标串通
Fury's colluding with the target.

51:15.680 --> 51:16.920
那他为什么要叫支援
Then why would he call us in?

51:16.920 --> 51:18.390
我只知道他也要抓
All I know is we take him in, too.

51:18.390 --> 51:19.510
不论死活
Dead or alive.

51:19.560 --> 51:20.680
不论死活
Dead or alive?

51:35.670 --> 51:36.960
上上
Go. Go, go!

51:49.550 --> 51:51.300
是我说错了什么吗
Was it something I said?

52:30.300 --> 52:34.280
其实  我并不需要这个也能看见
Now, you know, I don't really need these to see...

52:34.770 --> 52:38.670
但这身打扮少不了它
but they do kinda complete the look.

52:39.700 --> 52:40.850
是不是
Don't you think?

52:58.490 --> 52:59.380
你叫他们来的
You called them in?

52:59.380 --> 53:00.660
我不好
My bad.

53:15.240 --> 53:17.030
科尔森  你发现他们了吗
Coulson, do you have eyes on them?

53:17.030 --> 53:18.190
他们不在下面
They're not down here.

53:20.440 --> 53:21.580
我们上楼吧
Let's try up there.

53:30.430 --> 53:31.800
-什么  -你的通讯器
- What? - Your communicator.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.660
在你手里显然不安全
You obviously can't be trusted with it.

54:04.690 --> 54:06.160
你会飞这玩意吗
Do you know how to fly this thing?

54:06.550 --> 54:07.450
试试便知
We'll see.

54:07.450 --> 54:09.690
回答会不会就行了
That's a yes or no question.

54:13.580 --> 54:14.560
会
Yes.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.500
这就对了
That's what I'm talking about!

54:46.630 --> 54:48.190
我们有个偷渡者
We got a stowaway.

54:52.110 --> 54:53.190
撑住  咕咕
Hang on, Goose.

54:58.690 --> 54:59.680
咕咕
Goose.

55:02.660 --> 55:03.700
不  咕咕
No, Goose.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.740
谁是只乖喵喵
Who's a good kitty, huh?

55:06.790 --> 55:07.900
咕咕
Goose?

55:08.350 --> 55:10.500
没错
Yes, that's right.

55:10.500 --> 55:12.570
谁是只乖喵喵  咕咕
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

55:12.570 --> 55:13.660
你是只乖喵喵
You the good kitty, that's right.

55:13.660 --> 55:15.300
看到认识的人了吗
See anyone you know?

55:16.760 --> 55:17.900
说来好笑
Funny story.

55:18.350 --> 55:21.930
我奄奄一息地被送到哈拉  失去了记忆
I arrived on Hala near dead. No memory.

55:22.900 --> 55:24.210
那是六年前的事
That was six years ago.

55:24.210 --> 55:26.230
所以你觉得你是那个
So, you think you're the pilot

55:26.230 --> 55:27.730
跟劳森博士一起坠机的飞行员
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

55:27.730 --> 55:29.580
我是说  最后见到活着的她们的人
I'm saying the last person to see them alive

55:29.580 --> 55:31.100
或许能告诉我们
could probably tell us.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.580
玛利亚·兰博
Maria Rambeau?

55:33.270 --> 55:35.090
我们怎么去路易斯安那州
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

55:35.800 --> 55:38.400
往东飞  在孟菲斯右转
Due east. Hang a right at Memphis.

55:39.830 --> 55:40.990
那个特工
That agent...

55:41.780 --> 55:43.950
阻止了斯库鲁人找到我们的那个
that stopped the Skrulls from finding us?

55:43.950 --> 55:45.500
科尔森  新来的
Coulson. The new guy.

55:46.110 --> 55:47.650
看来他还不恨我
I guess he doesn't hate me yet.

55:47.770 --> 55:49.390
是啊  给他时间吧
Yeah, well, give him time.

55:51.050 --> 55:53.110
看来他是有种感觉
I guess he had a feeling, you know?

55:53.110 --> 55:55.110
于是听从了直觉  而违抗命令
Went with his gut against orders.

55:55.480 --> 55:56.940
这是很难做到的
That's a really hard thing to do.

55:56.940 --> 55:59.080
但也是我们的人性
But it's what keeps us human.

55:59.080 --> 56:01.450
我经常为此惹麻烦呢
I get in trouble for that. A lot.

56:01.450 --> 56:03.240
这我看出来了
I can see that about you.

56:04.030 --> 56:07.430
营救把你出卖给斯库鲁人的家伙
Rescuing the guy who sold you out to the Skrulls?

56:08.110 --> 56:11.160
那不是标准的克里人行动规章吧
I'm guessing that's not standard Kree operating procedure.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.490
如果你不向我上级打小报告  那我也不说
Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine.

56:21.680 --> 56:22.680
罗南
Ronan.

56:22.730 --> 56:24.730
指控者已完成了行动
The Accusers completed their operation...

56:24.740 --> 56:27.310
但因为你们小队  更重要的任务失败了
but the greater mission was a failure, thanks to your team.

56:27.320 --> 56:28.740
那是个陷阱
It was a trap

56:28.920 --> 56:31.930
是为引诱我们的特工弗斯到托法  好绑架她
to lure our operative Vers to Torfa and kidnap her.

56:31.930 --> 56:33.010
告诉我们地点
Give us their location.

56:33.010 --> 56:34.760
我们会解决恐怖分子威胁
We'll take care of the terrorist threat.

56:34.760 --> 56:36.640
你要把他们炸出银河系吗
By bombing them out of the galaxy?

56:37.930 --> 56:40.080
不  我们来解决
No, we'll handle this.

56:40.080 --> 56:41.960
不论在哪  一小撮斯库鲁人
A cell of Skrulls anywhere

56:41.960 --> 56:44.250
对所有克里人都是威胁
is a threat to Kree everywhere.

56:44.250 --> 56:45.380
他们在哪
Where are they?

56:45.380 --> 56:46.760
-他们...  -不见了
- They are... - Lost.

56:48.440 --> 56:50.490
暂时下落不明
They are lost for now.

56:51.030 --> 56:52.390
但我们会找到他们的
But we will find them.

56:52.580 --> 56:53.620
那去吧
Do so,

56:54.970 --> 56:56.330
否则我们就接手
or we will.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.430
继续航向C53
Maintain the course for C-53.

57:21.520 --> 57:23.860
打扰  我找玛利亚·兰博
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

57:26.420 --> 57:27.600
卡罗尔阿姨
Auntie Carol?

57:27.700 --> 57:29.810
妈妈  是卡罗尔阿姨
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

57:30.970 --> 57:33.350
我就知道  大家都说你死了
I knew it! Everyone said you were dead!

57:33.640 --> 57:35.260
但我们知道他们说谎了
But we knew they were lying.

57:37.770 --> 57:39.840
我不是你以为的那个人
I'm not really who you think I am.

57:48.930 --> 57:51.100
这是我听过的最疯狂的故事了
That is the craziest shit I ever heard.

57:51.100 --> 57:54.210
会变形的绿外星人  没有这种事
Green transforming aliens? There's no such thing.

57:54.220 --> 57:55.850
你说得太对了  小姑娘
You are absolutely right, young lady.

57:55.860 --> 57:57.490
是没有这种事
There is no such thing.

57:57.490 --> 57:58.900
因为即便有
'Cause if there were,

57:58.990 --> 58:01.590
我们也不会想说出去
we would want to keep that to ourselves.

58:01.590 --> 58:02.850
你不信吗
You don't believe me?

58:10.790 --> 58:12.340
不会吧
No way!

58:12.480 --> 58:13.970
好酷啊
That's so cool!

58:14.550 --> 58:17.220
她的手可不止能泡茶呢
She can do a lot more than make tea with those hands.

58:17.220 --> 58:18.740
比如呢  露两手
Like what? Show us.

58:19.090 --> 58:20.310
待会儿的吧
Maybe later.

58:21.190 --> 58:22.340
你的东西我都还留着呢
I kept all your stuff.

58:22.340 --> 58:23.480
我去拿
I'll go get it.

58:24.750 --> 58:26.360
你要去帮帮她吗
You want to give her a hand with that?

58:42.750 --> 58:44.470
你什么都不记得了
You don't remember anything?

58:46.220 --> 58:49.480
我会看到些片段
I see flashes.

58:50.600 --> 58:51.980
一些时刻
Little moments.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.530
但我不知道那是不是真的
But I can't tell what's real.

58:56.810 --> 58:59.600
如果我可以把那天早上发生的事拼凑起来
If I could just piece together what happened that morning...

59:00.600 --> 59:02.760
或许就都能说得通了
maybe it'll all make sense.

59:05.560 --> 59:09.420
你破晓时猛敲我的门  把我吵醒了
You woke me up banging on my door at dawn.

59:09.490 --> 59:10.890
你总这样
Your usual move.

59:11.760 --> 59:14.160
当时  我们必须起得很早
Back then, we had to get up so early.

59:14.600 --> 59:17.280
空军还是不许女性飞战斗任务
The Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat...

59:17.280 --> 59:19.750
所以  为劳森测试飞机是我们
so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot

59:19.750 --> 59:21.240
唯一能做点要紧事的机会
at doing something that mattered.

59:21.240 --> 59:24.240
你想开你的老野马飙车去基地
You wanted to race to base in your old Mustang...

59:24.270 --> 59:25.300
我并不想跟你争
and I wasn't about to argue,

59:25.300 --> 59:27.170
因为我知道我的科迈罗稳赢不输
'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate.

59:27.170 --> 59:29.520
但你作弊了  走了捷径
But you cheated, took a shortcut.

59:29.530 --> 59:30.790
捷径怎么就算作弊了
Since when is a shortcut cheating?

59:30.790 --> 59:33.270
因为那有违预定的交战规则
Since it violates the predetermined rules of engagement.

59:33.270 --> 59:35.120
这我可绝对不记得
I definitely don't remember those.

59:35.390 --> 59:36.590
当然了
Of course you don't.

59:41.510 --> 59:46.590
我到机库时  劳森很焦躁
When I got to the hangar, Lawson was agitated.

59:46.800 --> 59:49.820
她说她还要拯救生命
She said she had lives to save.

59:50.810 --> 59:52.630
她想自己开艾西斯
She was trying to take the Asis up herself,

59:52.640 --> 59:53.780
但你说...
but you said that...

59:53.780 --> 59:57.370
如果事关人命  那我要来开
If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.

59:57.370 --> 59:58.420
对
Yeah.

59:58.770 --> 59:59.740
对
Yep.

59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.600
重大的英雄时刻
Big hero moment.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.530
那种我们都一直在等待的时刻
The kind of moment we'd both been waiting for.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.750
博士一向很特别
The doc was always unique.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.740
所以我们喜欢她
That's why we liked her.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.490
但现在你说她是另一个星球来的
But now you're saying she's from another planet.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.650
我知道你肯定很难接受
I know this must be hard for you.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:19.330
怎么  这部分吗
Oh, what? This part right here?

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.860
不  不
No. No.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.780
难的部分是失去我最好的朋友
What's hard is losing my best friend...

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:31.420
但这任务太机密
in a mission so secret

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.680
他们就假装什么都没发生
they act like it never even happened.

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:39.280
难的部分是知道你一直都活在某处
Hard is knowing you were out there somewhere

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.150
固执地不肯死去
too damn stubborn to die.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.630
现在时隔六年  你又跑来
And now you come up in here after six years...

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.700
双手能发射高能
with your supercharged fire hands...

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.290
还要我喊你
and you expect me to call you...

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.400
什么...弗斯吗
I don't even know what. Vers?

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.020
你现在真是这个人了吗
Is that really who you are now?

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.560
我不知道
I don't know.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.350
来看看
Come look!

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.230
这是我们在万圣节时
This is me and you on Halloween.

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:15.880
著名女飞行员

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:15.880
我是阿梅莉亚·埃尔哈特
I'm Amelia Earhart

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.400
摇滚女星

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.400
你是詹尼斯·乔普林
and you're Janis Joplin.

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:19.150
这是你小时候
This is you when you were little.

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:21.000
你跟你父母关系不好
You didn't get along with your parents...

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
所以妈妈说  我们成了你真正的家人
so Mom said we became your real family.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.800
这是我们圣诞节的时候
This is us on Christmas.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.180
我收到了我最喜欢的兔子拖鞋
I got my favorite bunny slippers.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.620
这也是张你小时候的照片
This is another picture of you when you were little.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:28.600
你一直想当飞行员

这是你刚毕业时
And this is right after you graduated.

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:31.490
这是你圣诞节时收到的狗狗

这是你空军小队的大合照

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.180
这是你和妈妈在一天训练顺利完成后照的
And this is you with Mom right after a good day of training.

01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:37.440
他们是三个你最喜欢的人

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:40.760
等等  我忘了
Wait. I forgot.

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.110
你的外套
Your jacket.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.940
我在上面洒了番茄酱
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.940
妈妈就不许我穿了
after I spilled ketchup on it.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:02.070
<b>卡罗尔·丹</b>

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.960
那是坠机时唯一留下的
That was all that survived the crash.

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.110
至少我们以为是
Or so we thought.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.050
别去开门
Don't answer that.

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.360
只是我的邻居
It's just my neighbor.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:14.340
他们能变形成任何人
They can change into anyone.

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.750
你好
Hi there.

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.520
有什么事
What do you want?

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:25.150
汤姆

认识你很高兴
Pleased to meet you.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.430
老天爷
Yowzers.

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:34.210
这里的静电可真要命
Static electricity out here's no joke.

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:37.270
我注意到你停在路边的那架大鸟
I noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road...

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:38.360
我只是想问
and I was just wondering...

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.140
我能不能带孩子们过来
if you mind if I bring the boys over

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.440
仔细看看
to get a closer look-see?

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.640
-仔细看看  -是啊
- A closer look-see? - Yeah.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.640
看停在路边的大鸟
To see the "bird" parked out by the road?

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:51.070
你装得还真像啊  是吧
You're really working overtime to sell this one, aren't you,

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.530
塔罗斯
Talos?

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.550
抱歉  汤姆  现在真的不太方便
I'm sorry, Tom. This really isn't a good time.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.660
我明天再去找你  好吗
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.750
好了
Okay.

01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:04.800
你该对邻居更客气点的
You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors.

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:08.370
说不定哪天还要去借糖呢
You never know when you're gonna need to borrow some sugar.

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:13.830
等一下
Now, hang on a second.

01:03:13.850 --> 01:03:17.430
先别急着挥你的魔术手
Before you go swinging those jazz hands around...

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.430
把你朋友家砸得稀巴烂
making a mess of your friend's house...

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.280
而且你家很漂亮  女士
It's a lovely home, miss.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.650
天呐
Oh, my God!

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.720
怎么回事
What the hell?

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.230
没人会伤害她的
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.750
别杀我
Just don't kill me.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.190
那样情况就真的麻烦了
That would really complicate the situation.

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:38.740
我再过五秒就要麻烦一墙的
I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.480
恶心斯库鲁脑浆了
with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.030
抱歉我模仿了你的上司
I'm sorry I simmed your boss.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:45.420
但现在  我以真身站在你们面前
But now I stand before you as my true self.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.900
没有欺骗
Without deception.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.390
那外面的是谁
And who is that out there?

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.370
好吧  有道理
Okay, that's a fair point...

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.340
但我相信你能理解
but I'm sure that you understand

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.540
我必须采取些预防措施
I had to take some precautions.

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:59.040
我看到你碾压了我20个最好的手下
I saw you crush 20 of my best men

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.470
而且你的手还被困着
with your hands bound.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.510
我只想谈谈
I just wanna talk.

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:02.390
上次我们谈时
Last time we talked,

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:04.000
我被倒吊了起来
I ended up hanging from my ankles.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.460
那时我还不知道你的身份
That was before I knew who you were.

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.680
我还不知道你跟其他人的不同之处
Before I knew what made you different from the others.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.360
我有段飞马计划的录音
I have an audio recording from Pegasus...

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.030
录的是六年前一场坠机中
of your voice from a plane crash

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.810
你的声音
six years ago...

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:22.120
那个设备好像被你们称为"黑匣子"
on a device I believe you call a "black box."

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.890
他们说黑匣子毁于了坠机
They told me it was destroyed in the crash.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.400
你怎么拿到的
How'd you get it?

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.520
她不懂
She don't understand.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.340
小姑娘  我有独特的技能  让我可以
Young lady, I have a special skill that kind of allows me to

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.700
进入我不该进的地方
get into places I'm not supposed to be.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.000
你再敢喊我"小姑娘"
Call me "young lady" again...

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.590
我就一脚踢到我不该踢到的地方
I'm gonna put my foot in a place it's not supposed to be.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.300
难道要我猜那是哪里吗
Am I supposed to guess where that is?

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:42.940
你的屁股
Your ass.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.740
好吧  我懂  我们都有点紧张
Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here.

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.430
但听着  我只需要你帮我
But, look, I just need your help

01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:49.140
解码一个坐标
decoding some coordinates.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.190
如果你坐下  听听录音
If you'll sit down and you'll listen to this...

01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:54.320
我保证  你不会失望的
I assure you, it'll be worth your while.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.160
把你的朋友叫进来  我就听
Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.080
好
Deal.

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:03.650
天呐  把那玩意拿远点
Oh, my God! Get that thing away.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.240
它怎么进来的
How'd that get in here?

01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:08.910
猫吗
The cat?

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:10.770
你不会怕这个吧
This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:12.180
那不是猫
That's not a cat.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.130
-那是噬元兽  -噬元兽
- That's a Flerken. - A Flerken?

01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:16.990

莫妮卡
Monica.

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:26.740
我为什么不能听
Why can't I listen, too?

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:55.780
怎么回事
What's happening?

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.230
在加载
It's loading.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:02.940

结束战争
To end wars?

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:20.540
对  但战争的规模比你想的要大
Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know.

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:23.120
该死
Damn it!

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.490
我不叫劳森
My name is not Lawson.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.070
我的真名是玛威尔
My real name is Mar-Vell,

01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:32.300
我来自哈拉星球
and I come from a planet called Hala.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.980
我想说你是脑袋糊涂了
I would say that you're delusional... but

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.530
但我们刚被太空飞船打下来
we just got shot down by a spaceship

01:08:37.530 --> 01:08:39.210
你的血又是蓝的
and your blood is blue.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.850
听着  我半辈子都在打一场可耻的战争
Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war.

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:47.200
你快走吧  别让我更加懊悔了
Now, skedaddle before you give me any more regrets.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.580
记住那坐标  好吗
Just remember the coordinates, okay?

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:51.930
你得单独救他们了
You gotta save 'em without me.

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:53.160
救谁  怎么救
Save who? How?

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:56.400
我得在他们找到前炸毁引擎
Now I gotta blow this engine before they find it.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.560
你干什么
What are you doing?

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.840
我们无意伤害你
We have no interest in hurting you.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.880
是吗
No?

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.090
因为你们猛烈的火力让我不那么觉得
'Cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.030
能量核
The energy core.

01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:28.970
在哪
Where is it?

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.850

那就没必要继续跟你废话了
Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.

01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:37.680
不  等等
No, wait!

01:09:44.370 --> 01:09:45.860
你是问那个能量核吗
You mean that energy core?

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.420
不
No!

01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:38.640
指挥官  她还在动  可以开火吗
Commander? She's still moving. Permission to fire.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.830
别开火
Hold your fire.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.860
什么都不剩了
There's nothing left.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.190
核被摧毁了
The core has been destroyed.

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:58.010
<b>弗斯</b>

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.680
她吸收了核的能量
She absorbed its power.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.520
她要跟我们走
She's coming with us.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.920
他骗了我
He lied to me.

01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:35.770
我所知的一切都是谎言
Everything that I knew was a lie.

01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:38.540
现在你明白了
Now, you understand.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:41.140
什么  我明白什么了
What? What do I understand now?

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.170
勇·罗格杀了玛威尔
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:44.340
他杀了她
He killed her...

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:46.310
因为她发现
'cause she found out that

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:50.720
自己站在战争中不正义的一方
she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.750
不
No.

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:54.230
斯库鲁人都是恐怖分子
Your people are terrorists.

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.860
他们杀无辜者
They kill innocents.

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:57.530
我看到托法上的废墟了
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

01:11:57.530 --> 01:12:00.690
那是指控者干的
Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for.

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:05.430
我们是作为难民在托法上生活
My people lived as refugees on Torfa.

01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:08.660
无家可归  就因为我们反对克里统治
Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule...

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.900
被他们摧毁了家园
and they destroyed our planet.

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:13.440
我们仅剩的不多的人
And the handful of us that are left

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.720
也会遭到屠戮
will be slaughtered next...

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:20.680
除非你帮我完成玛威尔的目标
unless you help me finish what Mar-Vell started.

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:23.370
她发现的核
The core that she found

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.110
能驱动光速飞船
would have powered a light-speed ship...

01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:27.120
可以带我们前往安全之处
capable of carrying us to safety.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.180
前往克里人找不到的新家园
A new home where the Kree can't reach us.

01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:35.030
劳森总说我们飞马计划的工作
Lawson always told us that our work at Pegasus

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.630
不是为了作战
wasn't to fight wars...

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.940
是为了结束战争
but to end them.

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:43.390
她希望你帮我们找到能量核
She wanted you to help us find the core.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.950
我已经摧毁了它
Well, I already destroyed it.

01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:47.660
不  你毁掉了引擎
No, you destroyed the engine.

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:50.560
但驱动它的能量核在其他地方
The core that powered it is in a remote location.

01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:54.370
如果你能帮我们解码坐标
If you help us decode those coordinates...

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:56.620
我们就能找到它
we can find it.

01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:00.650
你会用它对付我们的
You'll use it to destroy us.

01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:05.410
我们只想要个家
We just want a home.

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:15.020
你和我都因克里人失去了一切
You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.880
你还不明白吗
Can't you see it now?

01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:18.940
你不是他们的人
You're not one of them.

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.940
你不了解我
You don't know me.

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:26.930
你不知道我是谁
You have no idea who I am.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:31.090
我都不知道我是谁
I don't even know who I am!

01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:34.840
你是卡罗尔·丹弗斯
You are Carol Danvers.

01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:37.900
你是那个黑匣子上录下的女人
You are the woman on that black box

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.870
为了做正确的事不惜冒生命危险
risking her life to do the right thing.

01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.190
我最好的朋友
My best friend...

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.480
在我没有其他人时  支持我这个单亲妈妈
who supported me as a mother and a pilot

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.020
和飞行员
when no one else did.

01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:54.030
你聪明  幽默  非常烦人
You are smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass...

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.940
你是我认识的最强大的人
and you were the most powerful person I knew...

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.920
哪怕是你还不会用手开火的时候
way before you could shoot fire from your fists.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.270
你听到了吗
You hear me?

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.330
你听到了吗
Do you hear me?

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:16.040
过来  过来  姑娘
Come here. Come here, girl.

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:18.040
有我呢
I got you.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.110
我知道我不配让你信任我
I know I don't deserve your trust...

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:27.850
但你是我们唯一的线索
but you were our only lead.

01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:30.470
我们发现你的能量信号
We discovered that your energy signature

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:32.880
与玛威尔的能量核一致
matched Mar-Vell's core.

01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:35.380
现在我们知道原因了
Now we know why.

01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:41.750
如果你知道它对我是多么重要
If only you knew the importance of it to me.

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.320
我就需要你帮我
I just need your help

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:48.160
破解玛威尔实验室的坐标
decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.

01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:51.970
那不是坐标  是状态向量
Those weren't coordinates. They're state vectors.

01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:53.930
环绕位置和速度的
For orbital position and velocity.

01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:55.650
你在地球上找不到她的实验室
You didn't find her lab on Earth,

01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:57.080
因为它不在地球上
'cause it's not on Earth.

01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:59.660
那是六年前坠机日时的地点
That was the location on the date of the crash six years ago.

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.820
只要追踪其轨迹
If we track its course,

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:03.470
马上就能在环绕轨道上找到它
we'll find it in orbit right now.

01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:05.160
只是基本物理
It's just basic physics.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.110
轨道环绕
In orbit?

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:12.500
就那么难破解吗
Was that so difficult to figure out?

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.810
你可是我的科技人员
I mean, you're my science guy, right?

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.360
勇·罗格很快就会找到我
Yon-Rogg will catch up to me soon.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.430
我们得在他之前找到能量核
We've got to get to the core before he does.

01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:21.860
我们上太空吗
We're going to space?

01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:23.530
乘什么去
In what?

01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:25.640
稍稍调整下你的飞机应该就行
A few tweaks to your vessel should do it.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.940
我可以负责改装
I can handle the modifications.

01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:29.340
你的科技人员
Your science guy.

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:38.140
我需要个副驾
Well, I could use a copilot.

01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:42.200
不  我不能
No. No, I can't.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.470
我不能丢下莫妮卡
I can't leave Monica.

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.040
妈妈  没事  我可以去外婆外公家住
Mom, it's okay. I can stay with Gramma and Paw-paw.

01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:49.550
我不能去  宝贝  太危险了
There's no way I'm going, baby. It's too dangerous.

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:51.660
测试新航空科技还危险呢
Testing brand-new aerospace tech is dangerous...

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.120
你以前不也做那个吗
and you used to do that.

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.280
你的计划是乘坐一架
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.190
原本不能离开大气的飞机离开大气
in a craft not designed for the journey...

01:15:58.190 --> 01:15:59.830
而且还可能遭遇
and you anticipate hostile encounters

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:02.400
科技更先进的外星敌人
with a technologically-superior foreign enemy.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.440
是吗
Correct?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:04.960
所以我说啊
That's what I'm saying.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.120
-你必须去  -莫妮卡
- You have to go! - Monica!

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.590
你有机会去执行任务史上
You have a chance to fly the coolest mission

01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:08.910
最酷的任务
in the history of missions...

01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:10.510
你要放弃这机会  坐在沙发上
and you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch

01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:12.280
跟我一起看《新鲜王子》吗
and watch Fresh Prince with me?

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:13.450
什么
What?

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:15.020
我觉得你该好好想想
I just think you should consider

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.800
你在给你的女儿立下什么样的榜样
what kind of example you're setting for your daughter.

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:27.160
这是怎么回事
What's going on around here?

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:27.870
我知道
I know, I know.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.520
我去里面解释  谢谢你们
I'll explain inside. Thank you.

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:36.750
你妈妈很幸运
Your mom's lucky.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.580
天上发孩子时
When they were handing out kids,

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.390
给了她最坚强的一个
they gave her the toughest one.

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:42.500
捣蛋中尉
Lieutenant Trouble.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.520
你记得了
You remembered.

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:47.160
那是我的吗
Is that mine?

01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:49.420
不
No, no.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:52.450
你留着吧  等我回来再说
You hang on to it until I come back.

01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:56.020
但有件事我需要你帮忙
But there is something that I need your help with.

01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:58.330
我不能再穿克里人的颜色了
I can't wear these Kree colors anymore.

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:01.720
而因为你显然是这里唯一
And since you are obviously the only person around here

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.340
有时尚感的人
with any sense of style...

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.070
不行
No.

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.610
绝对不行
Definitely not.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.660
既然我们是一队的
Well, since we're on the same team...

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.860
我看上去如何
How do I look?

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.730
靓丽
Fresh.

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:06.130
你怎么才来
What took you so long?

01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:09.260
我很好  多谢关心
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:12.080
-PRY46B  -不  不说密码了
- PRY46-B... - No, no codes.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.230
这系统不可靠了  我们都知道了
That system is fallible, as we've learned.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.770
好吧  那我们开始吧
Okay, then let's do this.

01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:20.760
我与至高智慧密谈时  看到的是谁
Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.770
你最崇拜尊敬的人吧
The person you most admire and respect, I'd guess.

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.410
但你绝不会告诉我是谁的
But you would never tell me who.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.640
你对哈拉最早的记忆是什么
And what is your earliest memory of Hala?

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.910
输血
The transfusion.

01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:33.280
蓝血流过我的血管
Blue blood running through my veins.

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:34.790

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.490
流过她血管的是我的血
That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:55.970
你把她怎么了
What have you done with her?

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:57.210
你太迟了
You're too late.

01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:15.790
她知道了
She knows?

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.810
罗南  斯库鲁人已潜入了C53

the infestation will be eradicated.

高度500  还在攀升
Passing 500 and climbing.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.490
你真的不该把那玩意放腿上
You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.

01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:54.010
我们跟你的联盟没那么可靠
Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best.

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.900
只要它还能吓到你
And as long as he continues to freak you out...

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.090
就像这样
like that...

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:00.090
嗯  我就要继续
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him

01:20:00.090 --> 01:20:03.620
爱它抱它  让它满意
all the loves and hugs that he needs, right?

01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:05.270
我能问你件事吗
Can I ask you something?

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:07.320
你可以想变成什么变成什么
Do you just turn into anything you want?

01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:09.180
我得先看到
Well, I have to see it first.

01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:10.700
你们都能吗
Can you all do it?

01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:12.620
从生理学上讲  是的
Physiologically? Yeah.

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:14.880
但这是需要练习的
But, uh, it takes practice...

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.980
不瞒你说  还需要天赋  才能做好
and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well.

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.460
-你能变成猫吗  -猫是什么
- Can you turn into a cat? - What's a cat?

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.120
那文件柜呢
What about a filing cabinet?

01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:26.510
我为什么要变成文件柜
Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?

01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:27.410
捕蝇草呢
A Venus flytrap?

01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:28.630
如果你能变成捕蝇草
I'll give you 50 bucks right now

01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.350
我这就给你50块
if you turn into a Venus flytrap.

Buckle up, folks.

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:47.350
这正常吗  是太空紊流吗
Is this normal, like, space turbulence?

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:48.490
差不多吧
Pretty much.

01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:23.900

就在这里  肯定在这里
It's here. It's gotta be here.

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:37.420
那是在空空荡荡前面还是后面
Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.940
去隐形启动

Is that it? The core?

01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:52.040
在她的笔记里  她称之为宇宙魔方
In her notes she called it the Tesseract.

01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:03.520
劳森怎么会有这么多孩子玩具
What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?

01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:04.620
<b>方子</b>

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.120

塔罗斯
Talos!

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.780
他不是来找宇宙魔方的
He didn't come here for the Tesseract.

01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.980
没事
It's okay.

01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:25.800
我们不知道该怎么办
We didn't know what to do.

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.870
玛威尔警告我们无论如何都不能发信号
Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason...

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.020
否则会被克里人找到

01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:32.590
你做得对
You did the right thing.

01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:44.150

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.460
这是战争
This is war.

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:05.060
我手上也沾满了鲜血
My hands are filthy from it, too.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.150
但我们走到了这一步
But we're here now.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.940
你找到了我的家人
You found my family.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.890
这只是个开始
This is just the beginning.

01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:20.130
我们还有数千人  散落在银河系各处
There are thousands of us separated from each other...

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:23.620
彼此分离
scattered throughout the galaxy.

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:38.530
<b>太空入侵者  最高分</b>

01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:43.960
如果我同一台弹球机玩六年
If I played the same pinball machine for six years...

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.760
也能打出很高的分
I'd have some high scores, too.

01:25:48.930 --> 01:25:50.690
亲近敌人
Fraternizing with the enemy?

01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:06.340
你把你的制服怎么了
What did you do to your uniform?

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:08.530
他们控制了她的心智  就像我们猜的那样
They got in her head. Just like we thought.

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:10.170
至高智慧能恢复她的心智
The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.

01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:12.110
你看得到他们不是战士
You can see they're not soldiers.

01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:14.140
放了他们吧  把我抓走
Let 'em go. You can have me.

01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:15.370
能量核呢
And the core?

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.500
你骗了我
You lied to me.

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:21.170
我让你成了最好的自己
I made you the best version of yourself.

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:27.920
赐予你的也能收回
What's given can be taken away.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.450
过去  快走
Back here! Move, move!

01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:44.490
过去  趴下
Get over here. Get down!

01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:47.910
快走  走
Let's go! Go, move!

01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:29.440
她来了
There she is.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:32.740
看来你在C53上的经历让你想起了曾经
Seems like your time on C-53 jogged the old memory.

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:35.170
这件外套
This jacket.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.820
真是帅爆了
It's killer, by the way.

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:42.870
音乐  真不错
The music. It's a nice touch.

01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:44.840
放我走
Let me out.

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.180
不行
No can do.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:50.260
如果你伤害他们  我就把你烧毁
If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground.

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:51.910
用什么呢
With what exactly?

01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:53.790
你的能力来自我们
Your power comes from us.

01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:56.110
这能力不是你们给的
You didn't give me these powers.

01:27:56.110 --> 01:27:56.970
是那场爆炸
The blast did.

01:27:56.970 --> 01:27:58.410
但你一直都不够强大
And yet, you've never had the strength

01:27:58.410 --> 01:28:00.000
不能自己控制好
to control them on your own.

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.490
物种  噬元兽
Species: Flerken.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:13.870
威胁程度  高
Threat: high.

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.260
它是只猫  不是汉尼拔·莱克特
It's a cat, not Hannibal Lecter.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.940
物种  人类男性
Species: human male.

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:29.000
威胁程度  几乎为零
Threat: low to none.

01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.710
那玩意显然是坏了
That thing's clearly busted.

01:28:31.710 --> 01:28:33.410
把噬元兽装上氦核飞船
Load the Flerken onto the Helion.

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.250
把其他的丢进太空
Eject the others into space.

01:28:39.610 --> 01:28:41.270
你做得很棒  王牌
You did good, Ace.

01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:43.840
因为你
Thanks to you...

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.020
那些险恶的变形人
those insidious shapeshifters

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:48.070
再不能威胁我们的边境了
will threaten our borders no more.

01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:50.040
我以前相信过你的谎言
I used to believe your lies...

01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:52.530
但斯库鲁人只是在为建立家园而战
but the Skrulls are just fighting for a home.

01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:54.640
你想摧毁他们
You're talking about destroying them

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.690
就因为他们不肯屈从你的规矩
because they won't submit to your rule.

01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:57.930
我也不会屈服的
And neither will I.

01:28:57.930 --> 01:29:00.920
是我们发现了你  我们把你接纳为我们的一员
We found you. We embraced you as our own.

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.120
你们绑架了我
You stole me.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.920
让我远离家乡  家人  朋友
From my home, my family, my friends.

01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:15.840
你的努力真是可爱
It's cute how hard you try.

01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:19.070
但记住
But remember...

01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:22.030
没有我们
without us...

01:29:22.210 --> 01:29:23.480
放弃吧  卡罗尔
Give it up, Carol.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:25.660
别起来了
Stay down!

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:27.150
你是弱小的
...you're weak.

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:29.690
你开太快了  你得慢点
You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

01:29:29.690 --> 01:29:30.540
你是不完美的
You're flawed.

01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:32.430
你是想害死自己吗
Are you trying to kill yourself?

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:33.970
无助的
Helpless.

01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:35.830
你太情绪化  好弱
You're too emotional and so weak.

01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:37.470
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.370
是我们救了你
We saved you.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.170
-控制住  -我说了  卡罗尔
- Control it. - I told you, Carol.

01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:42.360
他们绝不会让你飞的
They'll never let you fly.

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.480
这不是小姑娘的游戏
This ain't a game for little girls.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:44.570
你吻技好生硬
You kiss like a horse.

01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:46.580
你一周都坚持不住  丹弗斯
You won't last a week, Danvers.

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:51.650
没有我们  你只是人类
Without us, you're only human.

01:29:53.410 --> 01:29:54.430
你说对了
You're right.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.290
我只是人类
I'm only human.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.130
在哈拉上  你重生了  成为了
On Hala, you were reborn...

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:36.700
弗斯
Vers.

01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:39.700
<b>弗斯</b>

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.800
我叫卡罗尔
My name is Carol.

01:30:59.510 --> 01:31:01.250
她想挣脱出来
She's trying to break out.

01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:48.560
我一直绑着一只手作战
I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back.

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:51.320
但如果我
But what happens when...

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.110
终于挣脱开会怎样
I'm finally set free?

01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:39.750
你知道你在发光吧
You know you're glowing, right?

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:41.030
回头解释
I'll explain it later.

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:44.780
拿走宇宙魔方
Take the Tesseract.

01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:46.130
留下午餐盒
Leave the lunchbox.

01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:47.640
-我吗  -对
- Me? - Yes.

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.210
我可不碰那玩意
I'm not touching that thing.

01:32:49.210 --> 01:32:50.870
要我给你找副防热手套吗
You want me to get you an oven mitt?

01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:05.860
带斯库鲁人上夸式战斗机飞走
Get the Skrulls on the Quadjet and go.

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.750
带上噬元兽
Take the Flerken with you.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.430
-那你呢  -我给你们争取时间
- What about you? - I'll buy you some time!

01:33:13.090 --> 01:33:14.990
我要把你抱起来了
I'm picking you up now.

01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:20.730
我相信你不会吃了我
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:27.300
你们好啊
Guys.

01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:32.530
为宇宙魔方掰腕子啊
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.330
我以前还觉得你挺逗
I used to find you amusing.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.620
我们做个了结吧
Let's put an end to this.

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.650
好吧
Okay.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.020
乖喵喵
Good kitty.

01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:05.160
你一直都知道
You knew all along.

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:07.830
所以我们才从不一起玩吗
Is that why we never hung out?

01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:09.320
不  我就是不喜欢你
No, I just never liked you.

01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:18.240
来啦
Incoming!

01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:27.070
着什么急
In a hurry?

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:30.350
别逼我这么做
Don't make me do this.

01:35:30.930 --> 01:35:31.930
那好
Okay.

01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:49.120
快点  吃了他们
Come on, do your thing!

01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:51.280
来啊
Come on!

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.790
来啊
Come on!

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.110
真是的  咕咕
Damn it, Goose.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.810
选好边吧
Pick a side.

01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:06.370
把他们也带去机库
Take them to the hangar, too.

01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:08.540
我们把他们都丢进太空
We'll blast them all into space.

01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:12.000
别激动
Play it cool.

01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:14.720
就像在哈瓦那时那样
Just like Havana.

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.700
你拿到那东西了吗
Do you have the thing?

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.180
被噬元兽猫吃了
Flerken kitty ate it.

01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:34.850
快走
Come on, move!

01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.010
快走
Move!

01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:38.020
看我的行事
Follow my lead.

01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:43.650
遮住她的眼睛
Cover her eyes.

01:36:52.230 --> 01:36:53.310
上船
Onto the ship!

01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:54.710
快走  快走
Let's go! Let's go!

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:19.960
好个移花接木
Nice diversion.

01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:22.260
我真以为我放进去了
I could have swore I put it in there.

01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:21.470
米涅瓦  开战机击落他们
Minn-Erva, take them down in the drop ship.

01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:22.530
好的
On it.

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.430
你没事吧  朋友
You all right, friend?

01:38:29.210 --> 01:38:31.310
好极了
Never better.

01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:37.980
有敌机追来了
We got a bogey coming in hot.

01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:18.670
好啊
Yes!

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:41.240
那是什么鬼
What the hell was that?

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.770
发射弹道导弹弹头
Deploy ballistic warheads.

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.370
这不可能
That's impossible.

01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:02.880
C53没有能摧毁我们弹头的
C-53 doesn't have a defense system

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.640
足够先进的防御系统
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:09.640
那不是他们的防御系统  罗南
That's not their defense system, Ronan.

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:15.230
干掉她
Take her down.

01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:27.520
回跳跃点
Return to the jump point.

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:30.640
我们改日再回来带走武器
We'll be back for the weapon.

01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:33.490
能量核吗
The core?

01:43:35.490 --> 01:43:36.530
是她
The woman.

01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:26.230
我真为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:29.540
自那天
You've come a long way

01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.930
我在湖边发现你  你进步了好多
since I found you that day by the lake.

01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:34.270
但你能克制住你的情绪
But can you keep your emotions in check

01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:36.080
直到打败我吗
long enough to take me on?

01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.310
还是你仍会如以往那样被情绪左右
Or will they get the better of you as always?

01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:42.590
我一直对你说
I always told you...

01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:43.930
等你可以
you'll be ready

01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:46.820
凭自身实力打倒我  你就真准备好了
the day you can knock me down as yourself.

01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:48.500
这一刻终于来了
This is that moment.

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:50.900
这就是见分晓的时刻  弗斯
This is that moment, Vers!

01:44:51.090 --> 01:44:52.660
停下那些花里胡哨的
Turn off the light show...

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.330
向我证明  你可以光明正大地打败我...
and prove to me you can beat me without...

01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:13.230
我不用向你证明什么
I have nothing to prove to you.

01:45:29.150 --> 01:45:31.030
目的地  哈拉
Destination: Hala.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.060
我不能空手而归
I can't go back empty-handed.

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.620
你不会空手而归
You won't be empty-handed.

01:45:35.010 --> 01:45:36.650
我会让你带句话回去
I'm sending you with a message.

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:40.200
告诉至高智慧  我会去终结一切
Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I'm coming to end it.

01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:44.230
战争  谎言  所有一切
The war. The lies. All of it.

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:46.950
你不能那么做
You can't do this.

01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:08.600
真悬啊  是吧  咕咕
That was a close call, huh, Goosey?

01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:12.490
那些坏蛋还在你里面吗
Those bad guys still in there somewhere?

01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:14.690
我的噬元兽啊
Mother Flerken!

01:46:14.690 --> 01:46:16.020
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You okay? - Yeah.

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:17.540
就是抓了一下而已
It's just a scratch.

01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:19.330
不
No.

01:46:27.610 --> 01:46:30.280
真不敢相信你卷入了一场最酷的肉搏战
I can't believe you got in the raddest dogfight ever...

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:31.300
而我没看到
and I missed it.

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:33.150
要我说  你到的正是时候
I'd say you arrived just in time.

01:46:33.150 --> 01:46:35.430
你飞得真的很漂亮
Some nifty flying you did out there.

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:37.750
神盾局总是需要你这样的好飞行员
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use a good pilot like you.

01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:39.260
我会考虑的
I'll consider it...

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.430
只要你不再说我的飞行"漂亮"
as long as you never call my flying "nifty" again.

01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:44.150
你的眼睛怎么样了
How's your eye?

01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:46.120
每秒都在愈合
Getting better every second.

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.570
我想问清楚
Just so I'm clear...

01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:49.290
索拉
you were Soh-Larr...

01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:51.790
-和那个神盾特工都是你  -凯勒
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent? - Keller.

01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:54.480
他把我上司绑了起来  盗用了他的身份
He tied my boss up, stole his identity.

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.490
我只是借了他的脸  我不是贼
I borrowed his likeness. I'm no thief.

01:46:57.490 --> 01:46:58.980
是有点像盗窃
It is a little like stealing.

01:46:59.130 --> 01:47:00.580
你是谁那边的
Whose side are you on here?

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.300
你康复前都可以在这里养伤
You're good to go here until you recover...

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.340
但你和你家人得换副新模样
but you and your family are gonna need a new look.

01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:07.350
我可以继续做你上司
I could go back to being your boss.

01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:08.240
千万别
Please don't.

01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:11.300
怎么了  我喜欢他那双漂亮的蓝眼睛
Come on. I loved sporting his beautiful blue eyes.

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.740
说什么呢  你们的眼睛最漂亮了
No way. You guys have the best eyes.

01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:16.020
-永远别变你的眼睛  -她的眼睛是很美
- Don't ever change your eyes. - She has beautiful eyes.

01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.950
多谢你了
That's very sweet of you.

01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:18.960

I was trying not to panic...

01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:20.850
我会帮你们找到家的
I'll help you find a home.

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:23.610
完成玛威尔的心愿
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.300
他们可以跟我们住这儿
They can stay here with us.

01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:28.460
不是吗  妈妈
Can't they, Mom?

01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:30.900
他们在这里不安全的  宝贝
They won't be safe here, baby.

01:47:31.670 --> 01:47:33.080
卡罗尔阿姨是对的
Auntie Carol's right.

01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:34.920
他们得有自己的家
They need their own home.

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.410
我很快就会回来
I'll be back before you know it.

01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:41.010
或许我可以飞上天  跟你碰头
Or maybe I could fly up and meet you halfway?

01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:43.830
那你得学会像卡罗尔阿姨那样发光
Only if you learn to glow like your Auntie Carol.

01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:45.680
或许我可以建艘飞船
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.760
-你又说不准  -是啊
- You don't know. - He doesn't.

01:47:57.190 --> 01:47:59.490
把宇宙魔方留在地球上
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:01.240
藏好
Hidden.

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:03.490
你确定那是马威会想要的吗
You sure that's what Marvel would want?

01:48:04.190 --> 01:48:05.440
是玛威尔
Mar-Vell.

01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:06.810
我就那么说的
That's what I said.

01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:09.440
是两个词  玛  威尔
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.760
玛威尔
Mar-Vell.

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:11.990
"马威"听上去好多了
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:13.700
就像惊艳合唱团
You know, like the Marvelettes.

01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:28.550
没印象吗
Not ringing any bells?

01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:30.450
继续唱  或许我会想起来
Keep singing. Maybe it'll come back to me.

01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:47.250
我给它升级了
I upgraded it.

01:48:47.890 --> 01:48:50.750
信号范围能至少覆盖几个星系了
Range should be a couple galaxies, at least.

01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:55.450
怎么  你觉得我会给你打骚扰电话吗
What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?

01:48:55.450 --> 01:48:58.620
仅限紧急情况
For emergencies only, okay?

01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:06.080
好吧
Well...

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.780
如果你再路过这个星系
if you're ever passing back through this galaxy...

01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:10.580
务必喊我一声
be sure to give a brother a shout.

01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:29.360

We got the ketchup stain off.

Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

是真的吗
So, is it true?

01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:21.890
克里人烧毁了你的眼睛
That the Kree burned your eye out...

01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:24.170
因为你不肯交出宇宙魔方
because you refused to give them the Tesseract?

01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:29.320
我既不能承认也不能否认这种说法
I will neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story.

01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:30.400

Understood.

很遗憾
I'm sorry to report

I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

Sir?

01:51:43.150 --> 01:51:47.270

had a prior commitment on the other side of the universe.

01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:57.790
单靠神盾局不足以保护我们
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can't protect us.

01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:00.930

We need to find more.

We found her, and we weren't even looking.
