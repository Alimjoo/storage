went to Germany

08:05.580 --> 08:07.490
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

08:07.660 --> 08:10.040

of Article 16,

08:10.120 --> 08:12.210

of the Sokovia Accords.

08:16.750 --> 08:18.420
he was allowed to return

under house arrest...

Because it's only a matter

It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

breaks your deal.

when you were down there,

you may have entangled
with her.

have something

23:50.810 --> 23:53.230
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

23:53.440 --> 23:56.570

the component as arranged.

for an answer.

either in business together...

gonna have to remain.

for my injured feelings.

24:18.260 --> 24:19.760

24:19.970 --> 24:22.680
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

24:22.800 --> 24:24.300

that component.

you're takin' from here...

24:26.560 --> 24:30.140

with us...

Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

watch you instead.

You promised.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.600
I know. I will.

55:03.770 --> 55:05.060
But not like that.

on that little girl...

This isn't truth serum.

Because I don't feel anything.

55:40.390 --> 55:42.100
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

There's no such thing!

Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

Okay.

Where is Scott Lang?

55:57.900 --> 55:59.070

<i>"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"</i>

56:06.540 --> 56:07.540
<i>And he was, like,
"Yeah, I know.</i>

56:07.580 --> 56:08.660
<i>"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever...</i>

56:08.710 --> 56:09.710
<i>"but now I'm all alone."</i>

56:09.750 --> 56:11.000

you'll find a new partner.</i>

56:21.550 --> 56:22.390

I'm getting there.

56:22.550 --> 56:23.800
You put a dime in him,

you gotta let the whole song
play out.

56:25.260 --> 56:26.970

- Right, right, right.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.280
So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,

56:42.280 --> 56:43.410
and he starts working
for Hank.

56:43.410 --> 56:44.700
<i>That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...</i>

56:44.740 --> 56:46.080
<i>"I want nothing to do
with you.</i>

56:46.160 --> 56:47.790
<i>"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."</i>

56:47.950 --> 56:48.950
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

56:49.000 --> 56:50.160
<i>"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i>

56:50.160 --> 56:51.250

<i>"but I'm gonna go trash an

<i>And then she said, "I can't

57:00.970 --> 57:02.430
<i>"Smell you later, dummy."</i>

57:02.590 --> 57:03.800
So, Scotty goes
on house arrest.

No, the probability fields
are too complex.

You have two hours.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.040
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.080
and it'll be another century

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.540
before they align
like this again.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.320
I have to go.

I'm just gonna borrow
the suit.

01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:35.050
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:36.760
- Don't bother.
- What?

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.050
We'll come
and get the suit from you,

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:39.300
as soon as we've found my mom.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.470

Honey, why don't you
go upstairs

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.290
and look under your bed?

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:10.580

You people have no shame!

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.650
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:38.690
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:45.070
But Daddy's super sick!

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.450
I'll see about that!

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.490
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:49.910
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.290

I'm just really sick.

get it out. You know?

It looks load-bearing.

After we lost it
the first time...

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:17.130
I put on a new tracker...

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.970
of sorts.

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.390
That'll work.

Listen, Ava.

This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.930
Maybe we should...

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.640
Maybe we should what? Wait?

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:11.940
I've got days until I'm dead.

01:13:13.190 --> 01:13:15.610
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:21.740
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:23.110
We don't have much time before

Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.

01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:26.330
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.620
So, we should do that.

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:33.960
One, we have to break
into that lab.

01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:36.540
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.880
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:41.420
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:43.180
Let's call it 2-A.

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.680
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.430
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:47.850
is fully grown
for you to come back.

01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:48.930
Otherwise, we're screwed.

You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.730
I'm going to dive.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.730
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:59.900
together,
protecting the tunnel.

01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:02.900
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:06.490
Let me get her.

01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:09.740
I think he's right.

I had him follow us.

some help.
