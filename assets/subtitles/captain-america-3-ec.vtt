18:01.430 --> 18:03.990
对不起  职业病
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.

18:04.460 --> 18:08.320
我在国务院工作  人力资源部
I work for the State department. Human resources.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.250
我知道这很无聊

18:11.100 --> 18:13.900
但这让我能养活我的儿子
But, it enabled me to raise a son.

18:15.170 --> 18:18.220
我很为他的成长骄傲
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.990
他叫查理·斯宾塞
His name was Charlie Spencer.

你杀了他
Your murdered him.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.500
在索科威亚
In Sokovia.

18:31.170 --> 18:34.240
当然  这对你来说毫不重要
Not that that matters in the least to you.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.350
你以为你为我们而战
You think you fight for us?

18:39.260 --> 18:41.230
其实你只是为自己
You just fight for yourself.

18:43.060 --> 18:46.620
谁会为我儿子复仇  斯塔克
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

18:47.790 --> 18:51.070
他死了  都怪你
He's dead. And I blame you.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.170
上月  在尼日利亚拉各斯  11名瓦坎达公民

19:03.170 --> 19:05.490
在复仇者联盟与雇佣兵的冲突中

我国人民的鲜血洒在了外国领土上
Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.840
不仅是因为犯罪行为
Not only because of the actions of criminals,

19:20.050 --> 19:23.830
还因为阻止犯罪的人的冷漠
but by the indifference of those pledge to stop them.

19:23.870 --> 19:29.430
牺牲无辜者取得的胜利  根本算不上胜利
Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.

19:29.430 --> 19:31.310
瓦坎达国王接着...
The Wakanda King went on to...

19:31.310 --> 19:33.330

19:33.330 --> 19:37.680
如果我们不回应此类行为  就会变成这样
Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.340
有什么法律权利在尼日利亚行动
like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nige...

19:47.910 --> 19:50.270
-都怪我  -不是的
- It's my fault. - That's not true.

19:50.270 --> 19:53.880
那就把电视再打开  他们可指名道姓了
Then turn the TV back on, they're being very specific.

19:53.990 --> 19:55.250
我早该拆除那件炸弹背心
I should've clocked that bomb vest

19:55.270 --> 19:57.140
而不是让你不得不动手
long before you have to deal with it.

19:58.550 --> 20:00.250
朗姆洛提到"巴基"

20:01.610 --> 20:04.490
突然间  我又成了那个布鲁克林的16岁少年
All of a sudden, I was a 16 year old kid again in Brooklyn.

有人死了

20:16.900 --> 20:17.950
这份工作
This job...

20:21.450 --> 20:23.820
我们尽可能救下更多的人

20:24.370 --> 20:26.110
有时并不能救每个人
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody,

20:26.240 --> 20:28.200
但如果我们无法接受这一点
but, if we can't find a way to live with that,

20:28.290 --> 20:29.330
下次
then next time...

20:31.490 --> 20:33.040
也许我们谁都救不了
maybe nobody get saved.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.390
小幻  我们谈过的
Vis, we talked about this.

20:39.390 --> 20:42.100
是啊  但门开着  所以我以为
Yes. But the door was opened so I assumed that...

20:44.080 --> 20:47.150
罗杰斯队长说斯塔克先生回来让我通知他
Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.

20:47.150 --> 20:48.910
谢谢  我马上下去

20:56.590 --> 20:58.110

21:02.440 --> 21:05.180
五年前  我心脏病发作
5 years ago, I had a heart attack.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.790
打高尔夫球后挥杆时昏了过去
and dropped right in the middle of my backswing.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.760
结果  那成了我人生最大的幸事
Turned out, it was the best round of my life

21:11.760 --> 21:15.960
因为经历了13小时的手术和三重搭桥术之后
because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass.

21:17.140 --> 21:20.920
我发现了四十年军队生涯没教过我的东西
I found something 40 years in the army never taught me:

21:21.720 --> 21:23.070
远见
perspective.

21:24.690 --> 21:28.740
全世界欠复仇者联盟一个无法偿还的人情
The world owes the Avengers an unpayable debt.

21:29.780 --> 21:32.580
你们为我们而战
You have... fought for us.

虽然有很多人把你们当成英雄
But while a great many people see you as heroes.

21:40.380 --> 21:41.790
但也有一些人
There are some...

21:43.680 --> 21:45.600

21:45.600 --> 21:48.380
你会用哪个词  国务卿先生
And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary.

21:48.380 --> 21:49.900
"危险"怎么样

What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals,

21:55.420 --> 21:58.180
习惯性地无视主权国家边界
who routinely ignores sovereign borders

21:58.190 --> 22:01.520
去哪  做什么  全凭自己意愿
and inflict their will wherever they choose

22:01.520 --> 22:06.020
而且老实说  对造成的后果也似乎毫不关心
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.880

不再是私人组织

If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes,

23:55.290 --> 23:57.570
肯定会有后果

30:20.220 --> 30:22.230
托尼  有人死在你眼皮下
Tony, someone dies on your watch,

30:22.230 --> 30:22.770
你不能就此放弃
you don't give up.

30:22.770 --> 30:23.650
谁说我们要放弃了
Who said we're giving up?

30:23.650 --> 30:26.450
如果不对自己的行为负责  就是放弃
We are, for not taking responsibility for our actions.

30:26.610 --> 30:28.090
这些文件只是在推卸责任
These documents just shifts the blames.

30:28.090 --> 30:29.580
对不起  史蒂夫
I'm sorry, Steve, that...

30:30.320 --> 30:31.930
这话自负得危险
That is dangerously arrogant.

30:31.940 --> 30:33.980
这可是联合国啊
This is the United Nations we're talking about.

30:33.980 --> 30:36.550
不是世界安全理事会
It's not the World Security Council,

30:36.560 --> 30:37.920
不是神盾局  也不是九头蛇
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not Hydra.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.940
对  但管理者仍是人  人有目的
No, but it's run by people with agendas

30:39.940 --> 30:40.710
而目的会变
and agendas change.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.710
那是好事  所以我才会在这儿
That's good. That's why I'm here.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.600
当我意识到我的武器落入敌手
When I realized what my weapons were capable of

30:44.600 --> 30:45.660
后果会多不堪设想时
in the wrong hands,

30:45.690 --> 30:47.350
我就停止生产了
I shut it down, stopped manufacturing...

30:47.350 --> 30:49.770
托尼  那是你的选择
Tony. You chose to do that.

30:49.770 --> 30:52.280
如果我们签字  就放弃了选择权
If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose.

30:53.660 --> 30:56.020
如果小组派我们去不该去的地方
What if this Panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.890
或是不许我们去该去的地方呢
What if there's somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us.

30:59.010 --> 31:02.150
我们也许不完美  但仍是最可靠的人
We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.

31:02.150 --> 31:06.340
如果现在不签  将来他们会强迫我们签
If we don't do this now, it's going to be done to us later.

31:06.660 --> 31:08.210
事实就是如此  到时会闹得很不好看
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

31:08.210 --> 31:11.340
-你是说他们会来抓我  -我们会保护你的
- You're saying they'll come for me. - We would protect you.

31:11.390 --> 31:12.820
或许托尼是对的
Maybe Tony's right.

31:14.270 --> 31:17.960
如果我们稍作妥协  就还有回旋余地
If, we have one hand on the wheel we can still steer.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.230
但如果彻底决裂...
If we take it off...

31:19.240 --> 31:20.120
你还是不是
Aren't you the same woman

31:20.120 --> 31:22.330
几年前跟政府叫板的那个女人了
who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?

31:22.330 --> 31:25.260
我这是...审时度势
I'm just... reading the terrain.

31:25.270 --> 31:28.620
我们在公众面前犯了些大错
We have made some very public mistakes.

31:28.740 --> 31:30.170
我们需要重获他们的信任
We need to win their trust back.

31:30.190 --> 31:30.980
慢着
Focus up.

31:30.980 --> 31:33.720
抱歉  是我听错了吗  你是在支持我吗
I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me.

31:33.720 --> 31:36.210
-我想反悔了  -不不  不能收回
- Oh, I want to take it back. - No, no, no. You can't retract it.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.380
谢谢啊  真是破天荒
Thank you. Unprecedented.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.560
好了  这事结了
Okay, case close.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.570
<b>她在睡梦中去世了</b>

31:40.770 --> 31:41.500
我赢了
I win.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.020
我得走了
I have to go.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.920
<b>伦敦</b>

32:19.950 --> 32:25.620

32:26.360 --> 32:27.460
现在
And now,

32:27.610 --> 32:30.170
我想请莎伦·卡特
I would like to invite Sharon Carter,

32:30.220 --> 32:32.290
上台说几句
to come up and say a few words.

32:45.300 --> 32:48.410
玛格丽特·卡特为人熟知的身份是神盾局创始人
Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D.

32:49.430 --> 32:51.830
但对我来说  她只是佩吉姑妈
But I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

32:53.830 --> 32:55.990
她办公室有张相片
She had a photograph in her office.

32:55.990 --> 32:58.860
佩吉姑妈跟肯尼迪并肩而站
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.960
作为孩子  这让我觉得很酷
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

33:02.130 --> 33:04.120
但这也是很大的压力
But, it was a lot to live up to.

33:04.370 --> 33:07.230
所以我从不告诉别人我们是亲戚
Which is why I never told anyone we were related.

33:08.270 --> 33:09.360
有一次我问她
I asked her once

33:09.360 --> 33:12.600
在女性饱受歧视的时代
how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage

33:12.600 --> 33:16.560
她是如何成为一名成功的外交官和间谍的
in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.530
她回答说  能妥协就妥协
She said, compromise where you can.

33:20.230 --> 33:23.230
不能妥协就坚持己见
But where you can't, don't.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.480
即使你身边所有人
Even if everyone is telling you

33:26.480 --> 33:29.850
都把错的说成对的
that something wrong is something right.

33:30.040 --> 33:33.060
即使全世界都叫你让开
Even if the whole world is telling you to move.

33:33.460 --> 33:37.250
你必须如大树般稳稳站住
It is your duty, to plant yourself like a tree,

33:37.380 --> 33:39.370
直视他们的眼睛说  "不...
look them in they eye and say, "No...

33:40.240 --> 33:41.500
你让开"
... you move."

33:53.420 --> 33:54.910
被解冻后
When I came out of the ice,

33:55.610 --> 33:57.420
我以为我认识的人都死了
I thought everyone I had known was gone.

33:58.710 --> 34:00.730
后来知道她还活着
When I found out that she was alive,

34:01.870 --> 34:03.610
只觉得还有她在很幸运
I was just lucky to have her.

34:04.070 --> 34:05.920
有你也是她的幸运
She had you back too.

34:08.150 --> 34:09.360

Who else signed it.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.080

I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords.

34:23.700 --> 34:25.610
飞机上还有好多空位
There's plenty of room on the jet.

34:29.260 --> 34:32.110
这虽然是最轻松的路
Just because it's the path of least resistance

34:32.120 --> 34:34.330
不代表就是错的路
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

34:34.430 --> 34:37.160
团结比团结的方式更重要
Staying together is more important than how we stay together.

34:38.510 --> 34:39.950
那我们要为此放弃什么
What are we giving up to do it?

34:44.860 --> 34:47.870
抱歉  小娜  我不能签
I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.

34:49.270 --> 34:50.200

Well, it's not always so flattering.

光是这一点就让我感激你能来  罗曼诺夫小姐
And that alone makes me glad you are here, Ms Romanoff.

Why? You don't approve of all this?

52:57.950 --> 53:00.290
这是杏仁体的一种下意识反应

他们控制不住害怕你
they can't help but be afraid of you.

53:02.590 --> 53:03.790
你也怕我吗
Are you?

53:03.890 --> 53:05.910
我的杏仁体是人造的  所以
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

53:09.170 --> 53:11.820
我以前对自己有一定的看法
I used to think of myself one way.

53:12.220 --> 53:15.850
但是  自从有了异能
But, after this.

53:16.530 --> 53:18.640
我就变了
I am something else.

53:18.800 --> 53:21.810

它的真正属性依然未知
its true nature is a mystery.

53:45.610 --> 53:47.610

53:47.630 --> 53:49.170
你怕它吗
Are you afraid of it?

53:49.330 --> 53:51.210
我想了解它
I wish to understand it.

53:52.090 --> 53:54.300
我越了解它  它对我的控制就越小
The more I do, the less it controls me.

53:54.300 --> 53:59.200
或许有天  我还能控制它
One day, who knows, I may even control it.

54:01.430 --> 54:05.630
我不知道这是什么  但肯定不是辣椒粉
I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika.

54:06.250 --> 54:10.840
我去趟商店  20分钟就回来

巴恩斯会被转移到一家美国精神病中心

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.700
而不是瓦坎达监狱

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:23.780
也不是绝对不行  但是
I'm not saying it's impossible. But

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.370
得有保障措施
there would have to be safeguards.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.300

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.570

还带小泳池
with a lap pool.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.440
放映室  这样保护人已经很好了
It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.050
保护  你是这么觉得吗
Protection? Is that how you see this?

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:50.000
这是保护吗  这是拘禁  托尼
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.960
她不是美国公民
She's not a US citizen.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.010

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.280
-她还是个孩子  -饶了我吧
- She's a kid! - Give me a break!

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.180
只有这样做
I'm doing what has to be done

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:00.920
才能避免我们更糟的处境
... to stave off something worse.

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:05.690
你就继续自欺欺人吧
You keep telling yourself that.

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:10.930

特遣队为什么要公布这张照片
Why would the task force release this photo to begin with?

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.630
把消息传出去  让更多人来找
Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.880
是啊
Right.

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.010
这是逼的人没法藏身的好方法

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.840
史蒂夫  我们找了他两年都一无所获
Steve, we looked for the guy for 2 years and found nothing.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.840
我们没炸联合国  这可非常引人注目
We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.910
对  但这不能保证
Yeah. But that doesn't guarantee

01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:03.510
陷害他的人能找到他
that whoever framed him would get him,

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:04.940
只能保证我们会找到他
it guarantees that we would.

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:12.640

我不想说
I don't want to talk about it.

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.720

01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:43.130
该死
Damn it.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.690
他又问了我一次  你会不会来
He asked me again if you're going to be there?

是哪一个巴基在说话
Which Bucky am I talking to?

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.330
你妈妈的名字叫萨拉
Your mom's name is Sarah.

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:39.070
你以前会往鞋里垫报纸
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.560
博物馆里可不会讲这个
Can't read that in a museum.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.720
这就行了  就没事了
Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.100
-我做了什么  -不少
- What did I do? - Enough.

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:48.060
天哪  我就知道会这样
Oh god, I knew this would happen.

01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:50.500
九头蛇给我灌输的东西都还在
Everything Hydra put inside me is still there.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.710
他只要说几个词就能激发
All he had to do was say the god damn words.

01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:54.460
-他是谁  -我不知道
- Who was he? - I don't know.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.950
那场陷害你的爆炸  害死了很多人
People are dead. The bombing. The set up.

01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:59.060
那个医生大费周章  就为跟你待上10分钟
The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you.

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.440
你不能只说句"我不知道"
I need you to do better than "I don't know."

01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:07.100
他想知道西伯利亚的事
He wanted to know about Siberia.

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:11.650
我被关押的地方
Where I was kept.

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:15.670
他想知道具体位置
He wanted to know exactly where.

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:17.110
他为什么要知道这个
Why would he need to know that?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.190
因为冬日战士不止我一个
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.640
很好
Good work.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.630
带我出去
Get me out of here.

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.120

01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:29.840
那还是在注射血清之前
And that was before the serum.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.240
他们都变得跟你一样吗
They all turned out like you?

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.250
更糟
Worse.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.950
那个医生能控制他们吗
The doctor, can he control them?

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.740
八九不离十
Enough.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:38.830
他说他想毁灭一个帝国
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.

01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:40.400
有那些人的帮助  他就做得到
With these guys he could do it.

01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:43.250
他们会30种语言  来去不着痕迹
They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight,

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:45.700
渗透  暗杀  颠覆
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize,

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.880
他们能在一夜之间毁灭一个国家
they can take a whole country down in one night.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.730
打得你措手不及
You'd never see them coming.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.020
搁在一周前这事会简单得多
This would've been a lot easier a week ago.

01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:55.520
如果我们告诉托尼
If we call Tony.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.120
-他不会相信的  -即便他信
- No, he won't believe us. - Even if he did...

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.410
谁知道《协议》会不会允许他帮忙
Who knows if the Accords would let him help.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.060
我们只能靠自己
We're on our own.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.330
未必
Maybe not.

01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:07.270
我认识一个人
I know a guy.

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:11.990
我猜你不知道他们在哪吧
I don't suppose you have any idea where they are.

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:14.320
会知道的  边防9队守着国界
We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.330
侦察机也在全天候搜查
Recons flying 24/7.

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:17.820
他们会有发现  我们就去处理
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.000
你不明白  斯塔克  这事不归你处理
You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle.

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:22.360
你显然无法客观对待此事
It's clear you can't be objective.

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.020
我要让特种部队负责
I'm putting special ops on this.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.500
如果交上了火怎么办
And what happens when the shooting starts?

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:26.660
你要杀了史蒂夫·罗杰斯吗
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.290
如果他不乖乖就范
If we're provoked.

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.320
要不是罗杰斯  我们在罗马尼亚
Barnes would've been eliminate in Romania

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.880
就能消灭巴恩斯了
if it wasn't for Rogers.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.520
有些本不该死的人因此丧命
There are dead people who would be alive now.

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:38.140
你倒想想我说没说错
Feel free to check my math.

01:15:38.150 --> 01:15:38.920
无意冒犯
All due respect,

能看见的  好吗  就是...
I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that...

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.470

是什么激励你早上起床
What gets you out of that twin bed in the morning?

But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not.

01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:14.500
如果你有了这份能力
Look, when you can do the things that I can,

01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:17.030
却不作为
but you don't...

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.440
之后发生的坏事
and then the bad things happen,

01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:23.730

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.970
最好跟漂亮婶婶说一声我要带你出去
Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.550
别告诉梅婶婶

I'm sorry.

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:32.770
如果你这么做
If you do this,

01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:36.210
世人会永远害怕你
they will never stop being afraid of you.

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:41.150
他们的恐惧我控制不了  但我的可以
I can't control their fear, only my own.

01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:59.100
走吧  还有一站呢
Come on. We got one more stop.

01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.380
早晚会找到的
It's just a matter of time.

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.450
我们的卫星在进行面部识别

01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:13.080
闪开  别逼我动手
Move, or you will be moved.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.690
虽然那会很有看头
As entertaining as that would be.

01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:18.800
你真觉得你能找到他吗
You really think you can find him?

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.490
我的资源很可观
My resources are considerable.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.870
是啊  世界花了70年时间才找到巴恩斯
Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes...

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:26.470
你大概花一半时间就能做到了
So, you could probably do that in about half the time.

01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:29.000
你知道他们在哪
You know where they are.

01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:31.040
我认识一个知道的人

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.850
你恐怕不太明白什么叫逃跑车吧
I'm not sure you understand the concept of a get-away car.

01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:38.390
这车低调
It's low profile.

01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:41.190
很好  这些东西可是很招眼
Good, 'cause this stuff tends to draw a crowd.

You know, he kind of tried to kill me.

01:25:55.290 --> 01:25:57.880
抱歉  那个我也会记着的
Sorry, I'll put it on the list, too.

01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:02.770

你知道我不是别无选择也不会找你
You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.810
你是帮我忙呢
Hey man, you're doing me a favour.

01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:06.340
再说  我还要还债
Besides... I owed a debt.

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:10.060
-多谢支持我  -我该行动起来了

他迫不及待呢
He's raring to go.

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.230
我给了他点咖啡
Had to put a little coffee in him... but

01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:18.170

天呐
Jeez.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.070

是场很棒的面试  但绝不会再有下次了
It was a great audition, but it'll... it'll never happen again.

01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:59.910
他们告诉你我们要对付什么了吗
They tell you what we're up against?

01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:03.880
好像是几个疯子刺客
Something about some... psycho assassins.

01:28:04.290 --> 01:28:06.290
这次我们的行动不合法
We're outside the law on this one.

01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:08.560
如果你跟我们来  就是通缉犯了
So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.

01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:10.470
早习惯了
Yeah, well, what else is new?

01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:13.330
-我们该走了  -有架直升机等着我们呢
- We should get moving. - We got a chopper lined up.

01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:20.240
他们在疏散机场

换装
Suit up.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.820
在机场总能碰到熟人  真是怪啊
It's so weird how you run into people at the airport.

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.760
-你说是不是  -非常怪
- Don't you think that's weird? - Definitely weird.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.030
听我说  托尼
Hear me out, Tony.

01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:54.420
那个精神病医生  他才是幕后黑手
That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:00.130
-队长  -殿下
- Captain. - Your Highness.

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:01.610

罗斯给了我36小时带你回去

That was 24 hours ago.

01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:08.320
-帮兄弟一把啊  -你抓错人了
- Can you help a brother out? - You're after the wrong guy.

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.270
你的判断力有问题
Your judgment is askew.

01:29:11.290 --> 01:29:12.940
你的老战友昨天杀了很多无辜者
Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.

01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:15.520
还有5个跟他一样的超级战士
And there are 5 more super soldiers just like him.

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.700
我不能让那个医生先找到他们  托尼
I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:19.740
史蒂夫

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.270
你知道接下来会怎么样
You know, what's about to happen.

01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:25.860
你这次也要打出一条血路吗
Do you really want to punch your way out of this one?

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.860
好吧  我没耐心了
All right, I've run out of patience.

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.120
内衣宝宝
Underoos!

01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:39.400

谢谢  落地不太理想
Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better.

01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:43.180
新服装...不太适应
It's... just the new suit...

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:44.450
等等  这不是事儿  斯塔克先生
Wait, it's nothing, Mr. Stark.

01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:45.580
服装很完美  谢谢您
It's-It's perfect, thank you.

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.370
嗯  我们不用开始闲扯的
Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.

01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:49.410

Okay. Cap... Captain.

01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:57.990

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.750

You did that when you signed.

01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:13.650
好吧  行了
Alright, we're done.

01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:16.550
交出巴恩斯  跟我们走
You're gonna turn Barnes over and you're gonna come with us,

01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:18.690
马上照做  否则

01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:19.840
一支联合特别行动司令部的分队
or a squad of J-SOC guys...

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:22.440
会来抓你们  他们下手不会留情的
with no compunction about being impolite.

01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:25.920
拜托了
Come on.

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.160

那是什么情况
What-What the hell was that?

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.050
这是你的吧  美国队长
I believe this is yours, Captain America.

01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:46.590
这可好  好了  停车场有俩

斯塔克先生  我该做什么

不是说好了吗  别靠太近  用网缠住他们
What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web them up.

好的  收到

01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:07.830
我不会说第二遍
I won't ask a second time.

01:31:09.930 --> 01:31:11.790
听着  我真的不想伤害你
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.580
不必担心
I wouldn't stress about it.

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.130
-那是什么鬼  -这年头谁都有点花招
- What the hell was that? - Everyone's got a gimmick now.

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:38.970
你有金属臂  太牛逼了  哥们
You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude!

01:31:40.290 --> 01:31:42.440
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent!

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.010
对不住了  队长  虽然不致命  
Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you

01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:59.720
但还是会挺疼的
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:06.860
旺达  我觉得你伤了幻视的心
Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.

01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:08.250
你把我关在房间里
You locked me in my room.

01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:09.900
好吧  首先  这说法太夸张了
Okay. First, that's an exaggeration.

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.060
其次  我是为了保护你
Second, I did it to protect you.

01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:13.760
-克林特  -伙计
- Hey, Clint. - Hey, man.

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:17.220
看来退休生活不适合你  高尔夫打烦了吗
Clearly retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.830
我玩18杆  杆杆进洞
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:22.480
就是射不偏
Just can't seem to miss.

01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:27.250
-凡事总有第一次啊  -让你转头了
- First time for everything. - Made you look.

01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:39.570
检测到多处挫伤
Multiple contusions detected.

01:32:39.570 --> 01:32:41.400
嗯  我也检测到了
Yeah, I detected that too.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.840
天啊
Oh, god.

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:53.310
伙计  这是你丢的吧
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!

01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:06.270
这翅膀是碳化纤维的
Those wings carbon fiber?

01:33:06.270 --> 01:33:07.580
这玩意是你射出来的
Is this stuff coming out of you?

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:09.760
如果是  这刚柔度就不难理解了
That would explain the rigidity flexibility ratio.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.280
我得说  真是牛逼
which, gotta say, that's awesome man.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.860
不知道你参没参加过战斗
I don't know if you've been a fight before

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:14.540
但我们一般没这么多废话
but there's usually not this much talking.

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:16.090
好吧  不好意思  我的错
Alright, sorry, my bad.

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.390
两位  我也想继续和你们打
Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.850
但我今天只有一项任务
but I've only got one job here today

01:33:23.850 --> 01:33:25.260
我得给斯塔克先生留个好印象
and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,

01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.900
真抱歉了  什么
so, I'm really sorry. What?

01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:32.610
你就不能早点那么做吗
You couldn't have done that earlier?

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.890
讨厌
I hate you.

01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:42.320
这可好
Great?

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.530
队长  接着
Cap, heads up!

01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:47.150
朝这玩意扔
Throw it at this.

01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:48.300
扔
Now!

01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:53.230
不是吧
Oh, come on!

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.120
天呐  我以为是辆水车
Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck.

01:33:59.970 --> 01:34:00.910
抱歉
Sorry.

01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:04.960
好吧  我现在被惹毛了
Alright. Now, I'm pissed.

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:06.960
这是计划的一部分吗
Is this part of the plan?

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:09.720
我本来计划对他们客气些的  想加大火力吗
Well, my plan was go easy on them. You want to switch it up?

01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:13.860
那是我们的飞机
There's our ride.

01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:16.530
跟上
Come on!

01:34:25.650 --> 01:34:27.090
罗杰斯队长
Captain Rogers.

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:30.880
我知道你相信自己是对的
I know you believe what you're doing is right.

01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:35.500
但为了大局  你必须马上投降
But, for the collective good, you must surrender now.

01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:54.350
怎么办  队长
What do we do, Cap?

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:56.790

-我没杀你父亲  -那你跑什么

那玩意根本不符合物理定律啊
That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.

01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:23.780
孩子  这里有很多你不懂的事

所以你很危险
That makes you dangerous.

01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:30.190

- Who's speaking? - It's your conscience.

01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:59.270

我们其他人走不了了
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.270
虽然我不想承认  如果我们想打赢
As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one,

01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:32.870
就得有些人输
some of us might have to lose it.

01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:35.090
这不是真正重要的战斗  史蒂夫
This isn't the real fight, Steve.

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.030
好吧  山姆  什么计划
Alright, Sam, what's the plan?

01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:39.520
我们得搞个大动静来转移注意力
We need a diversion, something big.

我有个大家伙  但坚持不了多久

01:38:46.650 --> 01:38:49.490
如果我把自己扯成了两半  也别回来救我
And if I tear myself in half, don't come back for me.

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:51.860
-他要把自己扯成两半了  -你没问题吗  斯科特
- He's gonna tear himself in half? - You sure about this, Scott?

I do it all the time. I mean once...

01:38:54.650 --> 01:38:56.910

不告诉你你父母的事  是照顾你的感情
by not telling you about your parents, I was sparing you. But...

02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:03.370

I can see now that I was really sparing myself.

02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:05.050
