00:19.437 --> 00:20.980
HAN KI Stark!

00:21.355 --> 00:22.606
He doesn't seem happy.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.025
Hello, Hank.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.361
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

00:27.445 --> 00:29.196
I took a detour...

00:30.281 --> 00:32.408
Through your defense lab.

00:33.159 --> 00:35.494
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

00:35.578 --> 00:39.582
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

00:39.665 --> 00:42.960
Even for this group, that takes nerve.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.545
You were instructed to go to Russia.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.630
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

00:46.714 --> 00:47.840
I'm a scientist.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.550
Then act like one.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.178
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.387
Help us put it to good use.

00:53.471 --> 00:55.890
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

00:55.973 --> 00:57.892
and now you try to steal my research?

00:57.975 --> 01:02.271
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

01:04.774 --> 01:05.900
Ah...

01:06.984 --> 01:08.944
--Easy, Hank.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.948
You mention my wife again

01:13.032 --> 01:15.076
and I'll show you ferocity.

01:15.159 --> 01:16.744
Don't look at me. You said it.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.164
I formally tender my resignation.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.541
We don't accept it. Formally.

01:22.625 --> 01:23.918
Hank,

01:24.001 --> 01:25.711
we need you.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.130
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

01:28.214 --> 01:30.508
Don't let your past determine the future.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.511
As long as I am alive,

01:33.594 --> 01:37.098
nobody will ever get that formula.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.773
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.025
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

01:48.109 --> 01:49.652
Yes.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.738
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.865
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.451
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

01:58.577 --> 02:00.121
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.664
He's no security risk.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.584
Unless we make him one.

02:44.415 --> 02:45.583
You like that?

02:45.958 --> 02:47.084
- You like that?

02:47.168 --> 02:48.586
Come get you some now.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.348
You didn't even move.

03:01.932 --> 03:02.892
Nah.

03:02.975 --> 03:05.186
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.270
You see this right here?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.614
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.532
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.369
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.413
All right, break it up.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.790
Break it up! Break it up!

03:43.933 --> 03:45.184
Scotty!

03:45.267 --> 03:47.019
What's up, man!

03:47.102 --> 03:48.562
Damn! Hey.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.940
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.068
Hey, what's up with your eye?

03:54.151 --> 03:57.238
Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

03:57.321 --> 03:59.198
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.242
- Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.453
You know what? I'm still the only one
who knocked him out.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.664
Well, I definitely didn't.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.749
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.335
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss
my celly getting out?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.711
Hey, how's your girl, man?

04:12.795 --> 04:13.963
Oh, she left me.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.882
- Oh.
-Yeah, my ma died, too.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.218
And my dad got deported.

04:20.678 --> 04:21.845
But I got the van!

04:21.929 --> 04:23.430
- It's nice.
-Yeah, right?

04:23.973 --> 04:26.308
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

04:26.392 --> 04:28.686
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.229
You're gonna be on your feet
in no time. Watch.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.772
- I hope so.
-Yeah.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.441
And I gotta introduce you to some
people. Some really skilled people.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.151
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.570
No, I'm serious, man. I'm not going back.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.116
I got a daughter to take care of.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.410
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

04:44.493 --> 04:47.413
Look, man, I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

04:48.163 --> 04:49.331
I'm gonna be fine.

04:52.710 --> 04:53.961
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.046
Would you like to try our
Mango Fruit Blast?

04:56.130 --> 04:57.131
Uh, no, thanks.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.634
Um, I will have...
I'll have a burger, please.

05:00.718 --> 05:03.262
Oh, we don't... We don't make that.

05:03.345 --> 05:06.265
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

05:06.348 --> 05:08.225
It's ice cream.
Baskin-Robbins.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.770
I'll just do, like, whatever's hot and fresh.

05:12.438 --> 05:13.439
Dude.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.316
Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.984
Sure thing, Dale.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.821
Darby, could you just, uh,
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.784
- Hey, Dale.
-Come on in.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.578
Pull up some chair.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.249
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

05:32.333 --> 05:33.500
You found out.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.836
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.297
Look, I'm sorry, all right? But I...

05:38.797 --> 05:40.007
No one would hire me.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.509
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.762
Look, I'm sorry.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.305
I don't do it anymore. I just...

05:46.388 --> 05:47.389
Respect.

05:48.599 --> 05:49.683
I couldn't be happier about it.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.143
- Really?
-Yeah.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.187
Thank you. Thank you.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.856
You really stuck it
to those billionaire SOBs.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.442
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

05:58.525 --> 06:01.028
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?

06:01.111 --> 06:03.197
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

06:03.280 --> 06:05.657
Well, I'm very happy in this job,

06:05.741 --> 06:08.035
and I really just appreciate
the opportunity to...

06:08.118 --> 06:09.578
Well, you're fired, of course.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.374
I can't really keep you on.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.125
Wait, what? Fired?

06:15.209 --> 06:16.293
Yeah.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.379
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.340
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
it was a cool crime.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.716
I'll tell you what, though.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.969
This will be totally off the books,
off the records,

06:26.053 --> 06:29.056
but if you want to grab one of those
Mango Fruit Blasts

06:29.139 --> 06:30.432
on your way out the door,

06:30.516 --> 06:32.976
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.850
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

07:13.392 --> 07:15.102
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.020
I was. I got fired.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.856
Damn. They find out who you are?

07:18.939 --> 07:19.940
Yeah.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.775
Baskin-Robbins
always finds out, bro.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.777
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

07:23.861 --> 07:27.072
- You want some waffles?
-Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.615
Oh. That's Kurt.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.868
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.371
- Nice meet you.
-Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.290
Who are you?

07:36.707 --> 07:37.708
Dave.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.586
Nice work on the Vista job.

07:41.545 --> 07:42.838
Vista job, yes.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.382
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.844
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.638
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.140
You mean you're a pussy.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.308
Yeah.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.226
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

07:56.310 --> 07:57.769
And it added up to millions.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.730
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.565
And what does he do?

08:01.648 --> 08:03.567
He hacks into the security system

08:03.650 --> 08:06.320
and transfers millions
back to the people that they stole it from.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.322
- Posts all the bank records online.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.240
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.037
What are you doing?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.163
Hmm?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.249
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.584
What do you want?

08:20.667 --> 08:21.668
Okay.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.171
My cousin talked to this guy
two weeks ago

08:24.254 --> 08:26.507
-about this little perfect job.
-No way.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.009
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.052
No!

08:30.135 --> 08:32.429
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.556
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.600
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

08:36.683 --> 08:38.769
I don't care. I'm out.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.830
Dr. Pym?

08:58.914 --> 09:01.333
Yes. I'm still alive.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.424
ID?

09:11.009 --> 09:12.970
Perhaps that will suffice.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.182
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.478
Is that Hank Pym?

09:25.566 --> 09:26.858
Good morning, Hank.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.111
Hope.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.697
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

09:32.531 --> 09:35.534
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that
you could find the time to join us today.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.995
More like "thrilled."

09:38.787 --> 09:42.583
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.084
What's the occasion?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.044
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

09:50.549 --> 09:52.259
We're ready for you inside.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.428
Ouch.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.974
I guess some old wounds
never heal, huh?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.726
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.688
You're in for a treat.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.111
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.363
How's your face?

10:16.366 --> 10:18.160
After you.

10:25.751 --> 10:28.962
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.381
This company's founder and my mentor,

10:32.090 --> 10:33.091
Dr. Hank Pym.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.692
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

10:50.776 --> 10:52.986
I immediately started
researching a particle

10:53.070 --> 10:55.822
that could change
the distance between atoms,

10:55.906 --> 10:58.742
while increasing density and strength.

10:59.242 --> 11:02.329
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

11:02.412 --> 11:06.667
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.669
Butjust imagine,

11:08.752 --> 11:13.006
a soldier the size of an insect.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.011
The ultimate secret weapon.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.983
An Ant-Man.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.320
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.118
Silly, I know.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.661
Propaganda.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.830
Tales to astonish!

11:46.331 --> 11:48.291
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

11:48.375 --> 11:52.212
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

11:52.295 --> 11:55.799
every single time I asked you,

11:57.384 --> 11:59.886
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

11:59.970 --> 12:01.596
Just a tall tale.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.723
Right.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.892
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

12:16.319 --> 12:19.906
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.826
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

12:22.909 --> 12:25.954
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.457
Could that be done?

12:29.374 --> 12:33.253
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.214
--Distinguished guests,

12:36.965 --> 12:40.761
I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.637
The Yellowjacket!

12:48.643 --> 12:49.770
Oh, no.

12:49.853 --> 12:53.148
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose
weapon of war

12:53.690 --> 12:56.234
capable of altering the size of the wearer

12:56.318 --> 12:58.403
for the ultimate combat advantage.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.489
<i>MAN". We live in an era</i>

13:00.572 --> 13:02.783
<i>in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves</i>

13:02.866 --> 13:05.952
<i>are undermined
by constant surveillance.</i>

13:06.036 --> 13:07.746
<i>It's time to return to a simpler age.</i>

13:08.330 --> 13:11.666
<i>One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly</i>

13:11.750 --> 13:13.043
<i>to protect their interests.</i>

13:13.794 --> 13:15.962
<i>An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,</i>

13:16.046 --> 13:18.381
<i>the Yellowjacket
can manage any conflict</i>

13:18.465 --> 13:19.841
<i>on the geopolitical landscape</i>

13:19.925 --> 13:22.010
<i>completely unseen.</i>

13:22.093 --> 13:26.014
<i>Efficient in both preventative measures
and tactical assault.</i>

13:26.723 --> 13:29.309
<i>Practical applications
include surveillance,</i>

13:29.392 --> 13:31.061
<i>- industrial sabotage,</i>

13:31.895 --> 13:36.274
<i>and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.</i>

13:36.358 --> 13:37.609
<i>A single Yellowjacket</i>

13:37.692 --> 13:41.404
<i>offers the user unlimited influence
to carry out protective actions.</i>

13:42.280 --> 13:44.991
<i>And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets</i>

13:45.075 --> 13:50.288
<i>will create a sustainable environment
of well-being around the world.</i>

13:50.372 --> 13:52.249
<i>The Yellowjacket.</i>

13:53.124 --> 13:54.668
So, it's a suit?

13:58.129 --> 13:59.840
Don't be crude, Frank.

13:59.923 --> 14:03.051
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.011
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

14:05.095 --> 14:07.973
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

14:08.056 --> 14:11.017
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.687
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.522
I really value your opinion.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.024
Thank you for coming. Hope?

14:18.900 --> 14:21.486
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.696
Thank you.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.534
You seem a bit shocked.

14:27.617 --> 14:31.872
Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.957
So you finally admit it!

14:34.708 --> 14:38.253
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.505
That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

14:40.589 --> 14:43.049
Don't do this.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.260
Dr. Cross?

14:46.511 --> 14:49.264
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

14:49.347 --> 14:51.224
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.517
Deal.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.403
We have to
make our move, Hank.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.529
How close is he?

15:04.613 --> 15:07.282
He still can't shrink a live subject.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.910
Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all.

15:09.993 --> 15:10.994
No.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.121
I have Cross' complete trust.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.373
- It's too dangerous.
-We don't have a choice.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.001
Well, that's not entirely true.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.838
I think I found a guy.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.674
Who?

15:29.012 --> 15:30.472
Daddy!

15:30.555 --> 15:32.057
Peanut! Oh!

15:32.140 --> 15:34.309
Happy birthday!

15:34.392 --> 15:35.393
I'm so sorry I'm late.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.062
I didn't know
what time your party started.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.647
It was on the invitation.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.482
He didn't get an invitation.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.067
But he came anyway!

15:42.150 --> 15:45.111
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.947
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.031
Oh, you don't...

15:48.114 --> 15:49.115
What are you doing here, Lang?

15:49.199 --> 15:50.700
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.494
You know, right now, if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.620
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

15:53.703 --> 15:57.040
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.294
Hey, look what I have for you.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.754
Can I open it now?

16:02.837 --> 16:04.547
Of course, sweetheart. It's your birthday.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.512
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

16:10.595 --> 16:11.763
What is that thing?

16:11.846 --> 16:13.556
He's so ugly!

16:14.057 --> 16:16.101
I love him!

16:16.184 --> 16:17.727
Can I go show my friends?

16:17.811 --> 16:19.729
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

16:20.397 --> 16:21.982
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

16:22.065 --> 16:24.192
Look, the child support
is coming, all right?

16:24.275 --> 16:26.277
It's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

16:26.361 --> 16:29.114
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But for now, I want you out of my house.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.699
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday.
-it's my house!

16:30.782 --> 16:32.075
- So what? It's my kid!
- Scott!

16:33.368 --> 16:35.704
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

16:35.787 --> 16:36.830
It's a birthday party.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.581
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.666
She's my daughter.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.167
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

16:41.251 --> 16:45.338
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.340
Your fiancé is an asshat.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.508
He's not an asshat.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.469
- Hey, watch your language. Okay?
-What language? I said "hat."

16:51.553 --> 16:52.929
Stop it.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.224
Really, Maggie? That guy?

16:56.307 --> 16:57.934
Come on!
You could marry anyone you want,

16:58.018 --> 16:59.352
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

16:59.436 --> 17:01.062
At least he's not a crook.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.692
I'm trying, okay? I've changed.
I'm straight.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.111
I had a job and...

17:09.654 --> 17:10.697
I wanna provide.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.324
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

17:13.408 --> 17:14.409
So much.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.787
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

17:17.871 --> 17:18.872
What do I do?

17:19.664 --> 17:20.957
Get an apartment,

17:21.499 --> 17:23.918
get a job, pay child support.

17:24.002 --> 17:27.213
And then we will talk about visitation,
I promise.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.716
You're her hero, Scott.

17:30.675 --> 17:34.888
Just be the person
that she already thinks you are.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.498
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.084
Yeah. Well, uh...

18:04.167 --> 18:08.630
Unfortunately, we can't just do
whatever we want.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.924
It'd be nice though, right?

18:12.342 --> 18:13.384
But there are laws.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.512
What laws? Of man?

18:15.595 --> 18:18.056
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.266
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

18:23.561 --> 18:26.648
Darren, I don't think you understand...

18:29.484 --> 18:30.652
Hmm.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.198
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.746
Goodbye, Frank.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.928
Thank you.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.810
You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.229
And today,
during my morning meditation,

19:06.312 --> 19:09.232
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.608
How's that?

19:10.692 --> 19:12.485
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

19:13.862 --> 19:17.490
I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.160
I devoted my genius to him.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.078
I could have worked anywhere.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.414
I chose my mentor poorly.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.041
You didn't even have a choice.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.044
He never believed in you.

19:30.962 --> 19:35.675
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

19:36.092 --> 19:39.095
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.724
Because his failures as a mentor,

19:42.807 --> 19:44.934
as a father,

19:45.518 --> 19:48.605
forced us to spread our wings.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.359
You're a success, Darren.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.529
You deserve everything
coming your way.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.717
Ooh.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.469
Stop cheating.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.804
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

20:23.181 --> 20:25.058
Maybe he didn't hear you.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.142
How was the party?

20:32.982 --> 20:35.485
- Tell me about that tip.
-What?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.528
I wanna know about that tip.

20:37.612 --> 20:40.240
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.700
Calm down, all right?
I just need to know where it came from.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.077
It's gotta be airtight.

20:44.786 --> 20:45.954
Okay.

20:46.037 --> 20:48.289
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.667
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.669
But there was a rose that saved the day.
it was delightful.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.755
<i>And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.</i>

20:55.838 --> 20:58.049
<i>It was actually the first pair of boobs
I ever touched.</i>

20:58.132 --> 20:59.759
It's the wrong details.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.177
It has nothing to do with the story.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.262
Go.

21:03.137 --> 21:06.766
<i>So, uh, he tells me that she's
working as a <i>housekeeper now, right?</i></i>

21:06.849 --> 21:10.144
<i>And she's dating this dude, Carlos,
who's a shot caller from across the bay.</i>

21:10.228 --> 21:13.314
<i>And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.</i>

21:13.398 --> 21:15.775
<i>Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO</i>

21:15.858 --> 21:17.902
<i>that is all retired now, but he's loaded.</i>

21:17.986 --> 21:21.739
<i>And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,</i>

21:21.823 --> 21:23.449
<i>and they get to talking, right?</i>

21:23.533 --> 21:26.953
<i>And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.</i>

21:27.036 --> 21:31.124
<i>"This guy's got a big-ass safe just
sitting in the basement, just chilling."</i>

21:31.207 --> 21:33.668
Of course Ernesto comes to me because
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

21:33.751 --> 21:34.752
<i>Of course, I ask him...</i>

21:34.836 --> 21:38.172
<i>"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?"</i>

21:38.256 --> 21:39.465
<i>And he says, "Nah, dawg.</i>

21:39.549 --> 21:41.759
<i>"All she said is that it's super-legit</i>

21:41.843 --> 21:44.012
<i>"and whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."</i>

21:47.056 --> 21:48.016
What?

21:48.099 --> 21:50.560
Old man have safe.

21:50.685 --> 21:52.770
--And he's gone for a week.

21:52.854 --> 21:54.814
All right.
There's an old man, he's got a safe,

21:54.897 --> 21:55.982
and he's gone for a week.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.150
Let's just work with that.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.693
You know what I'm saying?

22:47.784 --> 22:50.661
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

22:50.745 --> 22:53.039
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.123
Comm check.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.333
- Check.
- Check.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.585
Hey, if the job goes bad,
you know I got your back, right?

22:57.668 --> 22:58.920
Don't worry.

22:59.003 --> 23:01.214
It's not gonna happen.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.426
I love it when he gets cocky.

23:11.474 --> 23:12.558
Damn!

23:40.378 --> 23:41.379
Alarm is dead.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.505
Nice.

23:44.841 --> 23:47.176
<i>All right,
I'm moving through the house.</i>

24:12.368 --> 24:14.245
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.914
It's got what?
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

24:16.998 --> 24:19.083
<i>Aw, man, are we screwed?</i>

24:19.167 --> 24:21.085
Not necessarily.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.176
I'm in.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.429
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.060
Oh, man.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.478
<i>What is it?</i>

25:21.103 --> 25:23.856
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.150
<i>How serious
are we talking, Scotty?</i>

25:26.234 --> 25:27.902
It's a Carbondale.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.403
It's from 1910.

25:29.487 --> 25:32.240
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.574
Wow.

25:33.658 --> 25:35.034
Can you crack it?

25:35.117 --> 25:38.538
Well, here's the thing.
it doesn't do so well in the cold.

25:38.621 --> 25:39.914
Remember what that iceberg did?

25:39.997 --> 25:41.707
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

25:41.791 --> 25:42.792
Killed everybody.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.418
Did not kill the Old lady.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.671
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.433
<i>What are you doing?</i>

26:40.516 --> 26:42.977
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

26:43.728 --> 26:46.022
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.524
<i>- What are you doing now?
- Waiting.</i>

26:50.109 --> 26:51.110
Waiting.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.369
Nice.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.250
<i>What is it? Cash? Jewels?</i>

27:07.501 --> 27:09.378
- There's nothing here.
-What did you say?

27:11.088 --> 27:12.882
- It's a suit.
-What?

27:13.507 --> 27:15.384
It's an old motorcycle suit.

27:16.427 --> 27:18.304
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

27:18.387 --> 27:19.847
No.

27:20.723 --> 27:21.682
It's a bust.

27:21.766 --> 27:24.268
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

27:24.352 --> 27:26.103
I know you needed to score.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.223
I thought we were using mice.

28:03.099 --> 28:04.225
What's the difference?

28:05.601 --> 28:10.481
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.358
--Darren, maybe we should think...

28:12.441 --> 28:14.902
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.987
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

28:41.512 --> 28:45.766
Experiment 34-C results,

28:45.850 --> 28:46.892
negafive.

28:51.272 --> 28:54.859
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.621
Why would you lock this up?

29:29.351 --> 29:31.604
This is so weird.

30:03.552 --> 30:04.970
Scotty, what's up, man?

30:10.226 --> 30:12.603
I wonder... What is this?

30:42.967 --> 30:46.512
<i>The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?</i>

30:46.595 --> 30:49.014
What? Who said that?

30:54.436 --> 30:56.313
Luis, down here!

30:57.022 --> 31:00.776
<i>It's</i> a <i>trial by fire, Scott.
Or, in this case,</i>

31:00.860 --> 31:01.861
<i>water.</i>

31:26.343 --> 31:28.637
<i>Guess you're tougher
than you thought.</i>

31:31.265 --> 31:32.808
Oh, I don't want to see this!

31:33.475 --> 31:34.727
Luis!

31:39.648 --> 31:40.691
Son of a...

32:57.810 --> 32:59.186
What the hell?

33:00.270 --> 33:02.773
<i>HANK". Not bad for a test drive.</i>

33:02.856 --> 33:04.942
<i>Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.</i>

33:05.025 --> 33:07.069
No! No! No, thank you!

33:19.248 --> 33:21.375
Get down on the ground!

33:21.458 --> 33:22.835
You are under arrest!

33:22.918 --> 33:25.671
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

33:25.796 --> 33:26.797
Oh...

33:29.133 --> 33:30.759
Don't move.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.056
<i>You know,
you almost had us convinced</i>

33:36.140 --> 33:38.225
that you were gonna change your ways.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.978
They were really rooting for you.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.606
It's gonna break their hearts.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.778
- You got a visitor.
-Who?

33:50.195 --> 33:51.196
Your lawyer.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.323
MY l8Wyer?

33:56.452 --> 33:58.871
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

33:59.663 --> 34:03.375
I'm starting to think that
you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.210
Oh, man.

34:05.753 --> 34:06.879
Sit down.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.552
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.512
I don't even wanna know
why you have it.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.556
Maggie was right about you.

34:19.141 --> 34:20.142
How do you know about...

34:20.225 --> 34:22.102
No wonder she's trying
to keep you away from Cassie.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.230
The moment things get hard,

34:25.314 --> 34:26.774
you turn right back to crime.

34:29.276 --> 34:31.445
The way I see it, you have a choice.

34:31.528 --> 34:34.156
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison,

34:34.990 --> 34:36.825
or go back to your cell

34:37.451 --> 34:39.912
and await further instructions.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.413
I don't understand.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.624
No, I don't expect you to.

34:43.707 --> 34:46.752
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly,

34:46.835 --> 34:48.170
neither do I.

34:49.088 --> 34:52.925
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

34:53.008 --> 34:54.176
What?

35:04.394 --> 35:07.648
Second chances don't come around
all that much.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.776
So, next time you think
you might see one,

35:10.859 --> 35:15.322
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

35:27.376 --> 35:29.545
<i>You're my bestest friend!</i>

35:29.628 --> 35:31.630
Are you sure you
don't want a different toy?

35:31.713 --> 35:33.632
No, I love this one.

35:34.258 --> 35:36.969
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.012
- M0mmy?
"Hmm?

35:39.096 --> 35:41.390
Is Daddy a bad man?

35:42.015 --> 35:44.852
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.937
No.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.858
Daddy just gets confused sometimes,
you know?

36:42.284 --> 36:45.287
<i>Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.</i>

36:46.330 --> 36:47.331
<i>Under the door.</i>

36:52.794 --> 36:54.046
Okay, where to now?

36:54.129 --> 36:56.131
<i>HANK". Hang tight.
-Oh, God.</i>

36:58.967 --> 36:59.968
What, what?

37:00.052 --> 37:01.053
Where the hell did he go?

37:01.136 --> 37:02.387
I have no idea. He just vanished.

37:02.471 --> 37:04.431
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

37:04.514 --> 37:05.724
Get back! Get back!

37:05.807 --> 37:08.393
<i>HANK". Scott, these are my associates.</i>

37:08.852 --> 37:10.312
Is that a camera on an ant?

37:10.395 --> 37:12.272
Yeah, sure. Why not?

37:12.356 --> 37:13.357
Where's the car?

37:13.440 --> 37:15.067
<i>No car. We've got wings.</i>

37:15.150 --> 37:16.443
<i>Incoming!</i>

37:26.370 --> 37:29.414
<i>Put your foot on the central node
and mount the thorax.</i>

37:29.498 --> 37:31.416
<i>- How safe</i> is...
<i>- Just get on the damn ant, Scott!</i>

37:44.554 --> 37:48.100
Why am I on a police car?
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

37:48.183 --> 37:50.602
<i>So they can give you</i> a <i>lift
past their five-block perimeter.</i>

37:50.686 --> 37:52.312
All right.

37:52.396 --> 37:54.356
- Now, what's the next move?
- Hang on <i>tight.</i>

37:54.439 --> 37:56.191
Oh, this is easy!
I'm getting the hang of this.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.901
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

37:57.985 --> 38:00.028
<i>You're throwing 247 off balance.</i>

38:00.112 --> 38:01.530
Wait, his name is 247?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.365
<i>He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.</i>

38:03.448 --> 38:05.951
<i>Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?</i>

38:06.076 --> 38:07.786
Whoa!

38:07.869 --> 38:09.705
<i>Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.</i>

38:09.830 --> 38:11.290
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

38:11.373 --> 38:13.375
<i>- No, I think it's 247.
- Wait.</i>

38:13.709 --> 38:15.294
<i>Hang on tight!</i>

38:15.377 --> 38:17.337
I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

38:17.421 --> 38:20.299
<i>I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.</i>

38:20.382 --> 38:21.341
What?

38:21.425 --> 38:23.302
- Can I make one little request?
-No.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.722
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

38:27.514 --> 38:28.682
Time out.

38:28.765 --> 38:29.850
All right, hold on.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.810
Just wait! Whoa!

38:32.394 --> 38:34.021
What happens
if I throw up in this helmet?

38:34.104 --> 38:37.482
<i>It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.</i>

38:37.566 --> 38:39.151
Let's set her down, all right?

38:39.234 --> 38:40.235
I'm getting light-headed.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.403
<i>Hang on, Scott.</i>

38:42.070 --> 38:44.031
I'm getting a little light...

38:44.114 --> 38:46.033
I need a snooze button.

38:46.575 --> 38:48.910
Hit me in 5 minutes.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.764
Hello.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.352
Who are you?

39:15.437 --> 39:18.190
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

39:18.273 --> 39:19.358
Yes.

39:19.441 --> 39:20.609
Why?

39:21.360 --> 39:23.445
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.615
Oh. Oh.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.450
Hey, look...

39:29.368 --> 39:30.369
Whoa!

39:34.998 --> 39:36.708
<i>Paraponera clavata.</i>

39:36.792 --> 39:38.293
Giant tropical bullet ants,

39:38.377 --> 39:39.920
ranked highest
on the Schmidt pain index.

39:40.003 --> 39:41.630
They're here to keep an eye on you
when I can't.

39:43.006 --> 39:45.759
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

39:46.343 --> 39:47.344
Who?

39:49.721 --> 39:50.722
Hey!

39:50.806 --> 39:53.475
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

39:59.898 --> 40:01.817
How am I supposed to do this?

40:08.031 --> 40:11.118
All right, just one step at a time.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.246
Ugh!

40:15.914 --> 40:20.419
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

40:24.214 --> 40:26.508
I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

40:26.591 --> 40:27.801
We don't need this guy.

40:27.884 --> 40:30.345
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

40:30.429 --> 40:33.014
I did. She's great.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.308
She doesn't think that we need you.

40:35.392 --> 40:36.768
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

40:36.852 --> 40:40.063
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

40:40.147 --> 40:42.732
and then Hope has you arrested.

40:42.816 --> 40:45.819
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.529
She's a little bit anxious.

40:48.071 --> 40:49.531
It has to do with this job,

40:49.614 --> 40:52.117
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

40:52.200 --> 40:54.453
I take it that you're interested in.

40:54.536 --> 40:55.620
What job?

40:55.704 --> 40:56.872
Would you like some tea?

40:57.414 --> 40:59.124
Uh... Sure.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.792
I was very impressed with

41:00.876 --> 41:03.670
how you managed to get
past my security system.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.924
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

41:08.008 --> 41:09.426
Were you watching me?

41:09.509 --> 41:12.721
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.182
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

41:16.683 --> 41:18.435
Oh! Excuse me.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.479
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

41:22.105 --> 41:26.067
Vista's security system was one of
the most advanced in the business.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.861
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

41:27.944 --> 41:29.863
But you beat it.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.281
Would you like some sugar?

41:31.364 --> 41:32.908
Yeah, thanks.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.079
You know what? I'm okay.

41:43.043 --> 41:45.212
How do you make them do that?

41:45.295 --> 41:47.923
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

41:48.006 --> 41:51.635
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

41:51.718 --> 41:53.887
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

41:55.847 --> 42:01.436
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

42:02.646 --> 42:04.523
I speak to them.

42:04.606 --> 42:06.983
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

42:07.067 --> 42:08.485
and see everything.

42:08.568 --> 42:10.445
And still know absolutely nothing.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.072
I'm late to meet Cross.

42:15.909 --> 42:17.661
Uh... Dr. Pym?

42:17.744 --> 42:20.080
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

42:20.622 --> 42:23.291
Sorry, I just have one question.

42:23.375 --> 42:25.460
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

42:25.544 --> 42:27.212
and can I go back to jail now?

42:27.295 --> 42:28.672
Come with me.

42:29.339 --> 42:33.426
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

42:33.510 --> 42:34.719
Huh?

42:34.803 --> 42:37.055
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

42:37.138 --> 42:38.848
That's what powers the suit.

42:38.932 --> 42:40.600
That's why it works.

42:41.810 --> 42:42.811
Wow.

42:48.191 --> 42:49.818
- Whoa!
-But it was dangerous.

42:50.485 --> 42:52.571
It was too dangerous.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.740
So I hid it from the world.

42:56.616 --> 42:59.578
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

43:00.495 --> 43:01.580
Pym Tech.

43:01.663 --> 43:02.789
Yes.

43:03.748 --> 43:07.544
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

43:07.627 --> 43:08.878
Darren Cross.

43:08.962 --> 43:10.005
He's a big deal.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.549
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

43:12.632 --> 43:16.970
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.347
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

43:19.431 --> 43:23.018
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

43:23.101 --> 43:26.771
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

43:26.855 --> 43:30.025
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

43:30.567 --> 43:31.610
But I wouldn't help him.

43:31.693 --> 43:35.530
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

43:35.614 --> 43:37.115
How could he do that?

43:37.198 --> 43:39.993
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

43:40.076 --> 43:41.411
She was the deciding vote.

43:43.580 --> 43:44.998
But she came back to me

43:45.081 --> 43:48.460
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.755
The process is highly volatile.

43:51.838 --> 43:54.674
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

43:54.758 --> 43:57.636
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

43:58.261 --> 44:00.680
I don't think Darren realizes this,

44:00.764 --> 44:03.600
and, you know, he's not
the most stable guy to begin with.

44:04.267 --> 44:06.436
So, what do you want from me?

44:08.521 --> 44:12.192
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

44:12.275 --> 44:13.276
Do you?

44:13.360 --> 44:14.819
I do.

44:15.487 --> 44:16.946
If you can help me,

44:17.030 --> 44:20.742
I promise I can help you be
with your daughter again.

44:21.785 --> 44:24.162
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

44:24.746 --> 44:25.830
Absolutely.

44:25.914 --> 44:29.668
My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

44:30.752 --> 44:32.128
What do you want me to do?

44:32.212 --> 44:35.590
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

44:38.468 --> 44:39.928
Are you gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

44:42.097 --> 44:44.307
Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up.
Text me.

44:44.391 --> 44:45.684
Okay. Good news?

44:46.059 --> 44:48.186
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

44:48.269 --> 44:50.814
Are you trying to find my daddy?

44:52.649 --> 44:54.442
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

44:55.735 --> 44:57.153
I just want your daddy to be safe.

44:57.237 --> 44:59.364
Hope you don't catch him.

45:45.535 --> 45:47.162
This isn't the first time these guys

45:47.245 --> 45:50.039
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

45:50.123 --> 45:54.169
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.588
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

45:57.172 --> 45:59.048
He always wanted my tech.

45:59.132 --> 46:02.427
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

46:02.510 --> 46:04.637
and destroy all the data,

46:05.305 --> 46:10.685
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

46:13.062 --> 46:17.150
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

46:18.485 --> 46:20.236
I spent half my life

46:20.320 --> 46:23.490
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

46:23.573 --> 46:27.327
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

46:27.410 --> 46:30.789
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

46:30.872 --> 46:33.416
This could change the texture of reality.

46:35.376 --> 46:39.380
Besides, they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

46:40.048 --> 46:41.966
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

46:42.634 --> 46:44.761
Scott, they are ants.

46:44.844 --> 46:48.765
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

46:49.849 --> 46:54.687
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

46:54.771 --> 46:58.358
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean,
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

46:58.441 --> 47:00.527
He's right, Hank. And you know it.

47:00.610 --> 47:03.196
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

47:03.780 --> 47:05.323
I was against using him
when we had months,

47:05.406 --> 47:07.367
and now we have days.

47:07.450 --> 47:08.451
I'm wearing the suit.

47:08.535 --> 47:09.911
Absolutely not!

47:09.994 --> 47:12.914
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.541
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

47:14.624 --> 47:17.335
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

47:17.418 --> 47:19.838
- We don't have time to screw around!
-Hope, please listen to me...

47:19.921 --> 47:21.464
He is a criminal! I'm your daughter.

47:21.548 --> 47:22.882
--No!

48:01.296 --> 48:03.047
She's right, Hank.

48:03.131 --> 48:04.799
I'm not your guy.

48:05.383 --> 48:07.719
- Why don't you wear the suit?

48:07.802 --> 48:10.013
You think I don't want to?

48:10.096 --> 48:11.306
I can't.

48:12.974 --> 48:14.809
I spent years wearing it,

48:15.435 --> 48:17.645
and it took a toll on me.

48:25.028 --> 48:26.362
You're our only option.

48:31.826 --> 48:34.662
Before Hope lost her mother,

48:34.746 --> 48:38.666
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

48:40.543 --> 48:43.838
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

48:47.175 --> 48:49.177
It's too late for me,

48:50.386 --> 48:52.138
but not for you.

48:52.221 --> 48:54.140
This is your chance.

48:54.223 --> 48:57.852
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

48:57.936 --> 49:01.814
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

49:02.523 --> 49:05.026
It's not about saving our world.

49:05.902 --> 49:08.738
It's about saving theirs.

49:11.699 --> 49:13.534
Damn. That was a good speech.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.203
Scott,

49:16.245 --> 49:20.041
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

49:23.211 --> 49:24.462
In the right hands,

49:24.545 --> 49:27.840
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

49:27.924 --> 49:31.678
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

49:31.761 --> 49:34.597
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

49:34.681 --> 49:35.890
you need to be fast.

49:35.974 --> 49:37.892
You should be able to shrink and grow

49:37.976 --> 49:39.143
on a dime.

49:39.769 --> 49:43.064
So your size always suits your needs.

49:44.107 --> 49:45.984
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

49:46.067 --> 49:50.029
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

49:51.906 --> 49:53.449
Ow!

49:54.742 --> 49:55.743
--Ahhh!

49:56.202 --> 49:57.745
--Ow!

49:57.954 --> 49:59.080
Useless.

50:01.416 --> 50:02.834
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

50:02.917 --> 50:04.836
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

50:04.919 --> 50:08.214
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

50:08.297 --> 50:11.634
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

50:11.718 --> 50:13.177
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

50:13.261 --> 50:15.054
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

50:15.138 --> 50:16.848
Show me.

50:16.931 --> 50:18.433
- Terrible.
-You wanna show me how to punch?

50:19.267 --> 50:20.268
Show me...

50:21.728 --> 50:23.479
That's how you punch.

50:23.563 --> 50:26.315
- She's been looking forward to this.
-No kidding.

50:26.399 --> 50:29.027
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

50:29.110 --> 50:31.195
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

50:31.279 --> 50:33.322
We lost her in a plane crash.

50:33.406 --> 50:35.116
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

50:35.199 --> 50:36.743
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

50:36.826 --> 50:38.619
We're working, here.

50:41.789 --> 50:43.374
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

50:44.292 --> 50:46.502
Were you going for the hand?

50:52.842 --> 50:54.969
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

50:55.053 --> 50:57.722
Do not screw with the regulator.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.557
If that regulator is compromised,

50:59.640 --> 51:01.184
you would go subatomic.

51:01.267 --> 51:02.643
What does that mean?

51:03.728 --> 51:05.897
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

51:05.980 --> 51:07.398
What does that mean?

51:07.482 --> 51:11.986
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

51:12.070 --> 51:13.112
become irrelevant

51:13.196 --> 51:16.032
as you shrink for all eternity.

51:16.783 --> 51:19.368
Everything that you know

51:19.452 --> 51:20.745
andlove,

51:21.662 --> 51:23.247
gone forever.

51:24.165 --> 51:27.460
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

51:27.543 --> 51:28.878
You've learned about the suit,

51:28.961 --> 51:31.672
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

51:33.007 --> 51:34.050
the ants.

51:34.634 --> 51:35.927
Loyal, brave,

51:36.010 --> 51:37.804
<i>and your partners on this job.</i>

51:43.851 --> 51:46.771
<i>Paratrechina longicornis.
Commonly known as crazy ants.</i>

51:46.854 --> 51:49.023
<i>They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,</i>

51:49.107 --> 51:51.567
<i>which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.</i>

51:51.651 --> 51:53.319
You're not so crazy.

51:53.569 --> 51:55.738
--Hey!

51:55.822 --> 51:57.115
You're cute.

52:05.581 --> 52:07.708
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

52:17.093 --> 52:20.763
it looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

52:20.847 --> 52:22.765
<i>There's a security guard posted
around the clock.</i>

52:22.849 --> 52:25.434
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

52:25.518 --> 52:28.062
Okay, who's next?

52:30.106 --> 52:31.440
Paraponera clavata.

52:31.524 --> 52:33.151
<i>I know. Bullet ants, right?</i>

52:33.234 --> 52:34.819
Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?

52:34.902 --> 52:36.737
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

52:39.532 --> 52:41.450
<i>The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,</i>

52:41.534 --> 52:42.827
and the only access point is a tube

52:42.910 --> 52:45.663
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.582
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

52:47.665 --> 52:49.876
<i>The tube is protected
by a laser grid,</i>

52:49.959 --> 52:51.711
and we can only power that down
for 15 seconds.

52:51.794 --> 52:54.380
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

52:54.463 --> 52:58.551
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

52:58.634 --> 53:00.803
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.055
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

53:03.139 --> 53:05.933
Ideal for ground and air transport.

53:06.017 --> 53:07.685
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

53:08.978 --> 53:11.272
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony."

53:11.355 --> 53:12.607
That's good. That's very good.

53:12.690 --> 53:17.320
Because this time, you're really gonna
have to learn how to control him.

53:17.403 --> 53:20.114
<i>Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.</i>

53:23.075 --> 53:24.368
AW! You okay? Did I hurt...

53:36.214 --> 53:38.257
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

53:38.341 --> 53:40.092
<i>The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.</i>

53:40.801 --> 53:42.053
<i>Red shrinks.</i>

53:43.095 --> 53:44.639
<i>Blue enlarges.</i>

53:46.557 --> 53:49.143
Solenopsis mandibularis.

53:49.227 --> 53:50.561
<i>Known for their bite,</i>

53:50.645 --> 53:53.356
<i>the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.</i>

53:53.439 --> 53:56.525
<i>They are handy to get you in and out
of difficult places.</i>

54:06.077 --> 54:07.828
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

54:10.498 --> 54:12.541
They're not listening to me.

54:12.625 --> 54:15.294
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

54:15.378 --> 54:17.338
No shortcuts, no lies.

54:17.463 --> 54:22.093
Throwing insults into the mix
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.678
We don't have time for coddling.

54:23.761 --> 54:25.930
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

54:26.013 --> 54:27.390
Really?

54:28.557 --> 54:30.142
Is that where our focus should be?

54:54.500 --> 54:55.626
H0pe!

55:04.427 --> 55:07.179
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

55:15.980 --> 55:18.274
We can't do this without her.

55:22.445 --> 55:23.529
Oh, God.

55:23.612 --> 55:25.573
You gotta lock your doors.

55:25.656 --> 55:28.534
I mean, really, there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

55:28.617 --> 55:30.286
Do you think this is a joke?

55:31.329 --> 55:33.831
Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

55:33.914 --> 55:35.166
You have a daughter.

55:35.249 --> 55:36.542
I'm doing this for her.

55:36.625 --> 55:39.587
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

55:40.379 --> 55:41.339
He was in grief.

55:41.422 --> 55:42.798
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

55:42.882 --> 55:45.468
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

55:46.427 --> 55:48.262
He just sent me off to boarding school.

55:49.597 --> 55:50.598
You know, I thought,

55:51.432 --> 55:52.808
with all that's at stake,

55:52.892 --> 55:56.020
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.022
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

55:58.105 --> 56:00.983
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

56:01.067 --> 56:02.443
Then why are you here?

56:02.526 --> 56:04.528
It proves that he loves you.

56:05.905 --> 56:08.199
Hope. Look at me.

56:09.492 --> 56:11.118
I'm expendable.

56:11.744 --> 56:13.204
That's why I'm here.

56:14.372 --> 56:16.207
You must have realized that by now.

56:17.083 --> 56:19.293
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

56:21.170 --> 56:23.506
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

56:25.424 --> 56:26.467
AnyWaY- --

56:27.802 --> 56:30.971
You know,
I didn't know you had a daughter

56:31.055 --> 56:33.265
when I called the cops on you.

56:37.311 --> 56:38.479
What's her name?

56:39.313 --> 56:40.815
Cassie.

56:41.565 --> 56:43.317
It's a pretty name.

56:46.737 --> 56:49.573
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

56:49.657 --> 56:51.617
That's how it works.

56:52.743 --> 56:54.161
Think about Cassie.

56:54.245 --> 56:58.165
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

57:06.882 --> 57:08.676
Open your eyes

57:08.759 --> 57:11.137
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.202
That's good!

57:53.095 --> 57:55.973
Your mother convinced me

57:56.056 --> 57:59.101
to let her join me on my missions.

57:59.643 --> 58:01.812
They called her the Wasp.

58:01.896 --> 58:04.106
She was born to it.

58:05.774 --> 58:07.735
And there's not a day that goes by

58:08.611 --> 58:11.614
that I don't regret having said yes.

58:16.076 --> 58:17.745
It was 1987.

58:18.579 --> 58:23.042
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

58:24.585 --> 58:27.546
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

58:34.970 --> 58:38.140
<i>The only way to the internal mechanics</i>

58:38.224 --> 58:40.142
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

58:49.443 --> 58:54.156
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

58:54.240 --> 58:57.493
<i>But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.</i>

58:59.203 --> 59:00.621
<i>Your mother,</i>

59:00.704 --> 59:02.081
<i>she didn't hesitate.</i>

59:04.250 --> 59:05.834
Janet! No!

59:12.591 --> 59:15.094
She turned off her regulator

59:15.844 --> 59:17.555
and went subatomic

59:19.056 --> 59:21.141
to deactivate the bomb.

59:22.977 --> 59:24.770
And she was gone.

59:29.191 --> 59:31.318
Your mom died a hero.

59:33.988 --> 59:36.323
And I spent the next 10 years

59:36.448 --> 59:40.744
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

59:44.331 --> 59:46.458
You were trying to bring her back.

59:48.085 --> 59:51.672
But all I learned was we know nothing.

59:56.677 --> 59:58.512
It's not your fault.

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:02.349
She made her choice.

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:11.525
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:14.570
I was trying to protect you.

01:00:16.405 --> 01:00:18.032
I lost your mother.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:22.911
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:25.122
I'm sorry.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:29.752
This is awesome.

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.504
It's awesome, you know?

01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:34.673
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:37.217
It's important.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.597
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.390
Yes, you did. Yes.

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.477
I'm going to make some tea.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.192
Nailed it!

01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:04.495
<i>That's a good boy, Ant-them.</i>

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:37.236
<i>The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.</i>

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:38.487
It's freezing!

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.906
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.493
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:47.287
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.l.E.L.D. days.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.039
We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:50.999
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

01:01:52.501 --> 01:01:54.002
It's currently collecting dust

01:01:54.086 --> 01:01:57.214
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:59.258
<i>Should be a piece of cake.</i>

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.218
You're over the target area.

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:03.595
Disengage now, Scott!

01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:04.847
Squadron A, go!

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.223
B, go!

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.768
C, go!

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:13.230
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:17.401
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:18.527
Stay calm.

01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:22.239
Guys?
We might have a problem.

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:25.743
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

01:02:25.826 --> 01:02:26.869
It's not!

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:30.164
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:34.376
- Scott, get out of there.
-Abort!

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.502
<i>Abort now!</i>

01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:38.338
No, it's okay.
it doesn't look like anyone's home.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.466
<i>Ant-them, get me to the mo“!</i>

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.426
He's gonna lose the suit.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.011
He's gonna lose his life.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.977
<i>All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.</i>

01:02:53.187 --> 01:02:54.688
Somebody's home, Scott.

01:02:57.858 --> 01:02:59.151
<i>MAN".
What's going on down there, Sam?</i>

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:00.360
It's the Falcon!

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:03.155
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

01:03:03.739 --> 01:03:04.740
Wait a second.

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.784
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:08.410
It's okay. He can't see me.

01:03:08.494 --> 01:03:09.536
I can see you.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.746
He can see me.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:15.042
Hi. I'm Scott.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.752
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:20.130
- What are you doing here?
-First off, I'm a big fan.

01:03:20.214 --> 01:03:21.840
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:23.842
I'm Ant-Man.

01:03:23.926 --> 01:03:25.177
"Ant-Man"?

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.346
What? You haven't heard of me?

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:29.181
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:31.058
You wanna tell me what you want?

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:33.560
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:35.354
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:38.065
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.566
I know exactly how that is.

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:41.527
Located the breach.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:42.778
- Bringing him in.
-Sorry about this!

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.076
What the hell are you doing?

01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:54.665
Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:09.137
Sorry!

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:10.722
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:12.474
That's enough!

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.207
Ant-thony! A little help!

01:04:49.845 --> 01:04:50.971
I've lost visual.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.481
He's inside my pack!

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:02.608
Sorry!

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:05.193
You seem like a really great guy.

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:34.348
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

01:05:37.643 --> 01:05:41.146
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:44.066
You jeopardized everything!

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.625
You got it.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:05.629
Well done.

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:06.672
Wait a minute.

01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:08.173
Did you just compliment me?

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:10.717
- He did, didn't he?
-Kind of sounded like he did.

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:14.054
I was good, wasn't I?

01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:19.226
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.812
Let us not dwell on the past.

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:23.981
We gotta finish our planning.

01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:28.026
Don't mind him.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:29.569
You did good.

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:37.703
Darren.

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:42.374
How the hell did you get in here?

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.836
You left the front door open, Hank.

01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:47.212
It's official.

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:48.422
You're old.

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:50.173
The plans.

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:53.176
He Will kill him.

01:06:56.388 --> 01:06:59.099
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.601
I have good news.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:02.936
Really?

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:04.771
What's that?

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:09.985
Pym Tech, the company you created,

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:13.864
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:17.701
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:25.459
You're welcome.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:32.299
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:34.968
This is my moment. I want you to see it.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:37.763
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

01:07:37.846 --> 01:07:39.139
I'll be there.

01:07:56.198 --> 01:07:57.657
What did you see in me?

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.243
I don't know what you mean.

01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:03.747
All those years ago, you picked me.

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.332
What did you see?

01:08:07.501 --> 01:08:09.294
I saw myself.

01:08:09.878 --> 01:08:12.297
Then why did you push me away?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.177
Because I saw too much of myself.

01:08:28.021 --> 01:08:29.439
<i>He knows. He's baiting you.</i>

01:08:29.523 --> 01:08:31.233
We have to call it off.

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:32.484
We're all taking risks.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:33.860
What if he saw me here?

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:35.278
He didn't. There's no way.

01:08:35.362 --> 01:08:37.739
- How do you know that?

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:46.498
Darren, hi.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:49.417
Hope, where are you right now?

01:08:50.043 --> 01:08:51.253
I'm at home. Why?

01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:53.088
<i>I just saw Hank.</i>

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:54.965
<i>I still get nothing but contempt from him.</i>

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:58.593
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

01:08:58.677 --> 01:09:01.138
<i>We need to start everyone working
around the clock.</i>

01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:03.056
<i>Get the assembly line up and running.</i>

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.391
<i>And I'm tripling security.</i>

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.476
Full sensors at all entrances

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.980
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:11.690
Great. Good idea.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:16.069
<i>Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.</i>

01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:22.993
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:25.036
But he is not onto you.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.497
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

01:09:27.581 --> 01:09:29.332
and closing exterior vents.

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:31.334
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:34.379
The water main.

01:09:35.463 --> 01:09:37.382
You can't add security to a water main.

01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:39.801
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

01:09:39.885 --> 01:09:41.094
that's how I get in.

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:43.346
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:44.806
to change the water pressure.

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:47.601
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.186
So we expand our team.

01:09:49.811 --> 01:09:50.812
What do we need?

01:09:50.896 --> 01:09:54.274
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:56.193
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:57.694
and kill the laser grid,

01:09:57.777 --> 01:10:00.071
and a getaway guy.

01:10:00.155 --> 01:10:04.117
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three Wombats. No way.

01:10:04.743 --> 01:10:06.203
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:09.873
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:11.833
Because we just robbed you.

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:16.963
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:18.340
Two smoothie machines.

01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:20.008
Are you sure they can handle this?

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:21.468
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:25.180
You'll forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:27.933
Well, hey, everybodyjust kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

01:10:28.016 --> 01:10:29.309
We know our business.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.770
We broke into this spooky-ass house,
didn't we?

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.271
Iletyou.

01:10:33.355 --> 01:10:36.650
Well, one could say that I let you let me.

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:40.028
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this.
-Yeah, we can handle it.

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:41.863
- You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

01:10:41.947 --> 01:10:44.449
- I'm in the system?
-You're in the system.

01:10:44.532 --> 01:10:45.700
The system?

01:10:45.784 --> 01:10:48.078
Yeah, we're doomed.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.204
All right.

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:50.956
There's something
you guys need to see.

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:52.874
When you get to this corner,

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:55.710
there's gonna be three offices
on your left side.

01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:57.128
Damn!

01:10:58.797 --> 01:11:01.508
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:04.261
Now, look,
this is gonna get weird, all right?

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:07.597
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.
There's no reason to be scared.

01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:09.015
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:10.934
- Really?
-Yeah.

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:12.143
Good.

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:21.236
This is the work of gypsies.

01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:22.445
That's witchcraft.

01:11:22.529 --> 01:11:23.697
Wow, that's amazing.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:25.782
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:26.950
That's some kind of wizardry.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.118
This is sorcery!

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.327
How'd you do that, bro?

01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:31.371
Don't freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:33.164
Ahhh!

01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:34.666
Get off! Get off!

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:37.294
Wait, I thought
Daddy didn't get scared!

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:40.964
I gave them each half a Xanax

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:43.633
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

01:11:43.717 --> 01:11:45.885
They fell right asleep.

01:11:46.553 --> 01:11:49.139
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.141
No, please don't.

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:53.685
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:57.605
I'm just glad that you might have
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

01:11:57.689 --> 01:12:00.775
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:03.528
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:05.196
to almost liking you.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.990
You really should write poetry.

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:12.078
Get some sleep, Scott.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:05.382
All right, just so we're clear,
everyone here knows their role, right?

01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:07.092
- Dave?
-Wheels on the ground.

01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:08.468
- Kurt?
-Eyes in the sky.

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:10.011
- Luis?
-Oh, man, you know it.

01:13:10.095 --> 01:13:11.554
You know what? I get to wear a uniform.

01:13:11.638 --> 01:13:13.223
- That's what's up.
-Luis.

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:15.517
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good.
I'm just excited.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.935
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:18.311
So, you know,
that makes me nervous, too.

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:19.396
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:21.356
- Oh, my Lord.
-She's not my...

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.733
You know what? I was thinking of
a tactic, like when I go undercover.

01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:25.735
Like a whistling. You know
what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

01:13:25.819 --> 01:13:28.863
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

01:13:28.947 --> 01:13:30.990
<i>It's not The Andy Griffith Show.
No whistling.</i>

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.051
All clear in Sector One.

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:56.349
Step out.

01:13:58.977 --> 01:14:00.145
All clear.

01:14:05.859 --> 01:14:06.943
We're set.

01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:08.862
Wish me luck.

01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:22.000
Utilities online.

01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:36.222
Hey! What are you doing?

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:41.394
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I'm securing it.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.105
I'm the boss.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:45.899
- Oh.
-Utilities 1.3...

01:15:00.038 --> 01:15:02.123
<i>Water level is dropping!</i>

01:15:30.652 --> 01:15:32.487
<i>Coming up on extraction pipe.</i>

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:33.947
All right, I see it.

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:45.458
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:51.673
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:58.471
- All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:10.942
The Ant-Man is in the building.

01:16:11.025 --> 01:16:13.945
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

01:16:15.989 --> 01:16:18.032
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

01:16:18.116 --> 01:16:19.325
This is problem?

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:21.452
Considering the Crown Vic's
the most commonly used car

01:16:21.536 --> 01:16:22.662
for undercover cops, man,

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:24.831
yes, this is problem.

01:16:28.668 --> 01:16:29.836
That's Pym.

01:16:32.547 --> 01:16:33.923
Oh, no.

01:16:34.007 --> 01:16:35.258
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:36.884
<i>Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...</i>

01:16:36.968 --> 01:16:39.887
<i>I don't remember what it's called,
but I feel bad for this guy.</i>

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.307
- What's up, man?
-Hey.

01:16:48.146 --> 01:16:49.606
Ow! Ow!

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:53.484
See? That's what I'm talking about.

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:55.945
That's what I call
an unfortunate casualty

01:16:56.029 --> 01:16:58.031
in a very serious operation.

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:09.417
Signal decoy in place.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.878
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:15.381
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:17.175
Scott, we have problem.

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:19.177
<i>Problem? What's the problem?</i>

01:17:20.011 --> 01:17:22.472
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:24.182
Listen to me.

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:28.061
If I don't get into this building,
people will die.

01:17:28.728 --> 01:17:30.438
That's awfully dramatic.

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:34.609
Are you kidding me?

01:17:39.072 --> 01:17:40.823
Problem solved.

01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:56.964
Well...

01:17:58.758 --> 01:18:00.593
How do I look?

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:10.895
There he is.

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:15.692
Just in time. Come on.

01:18:24.992 --> 01:18:26.869
<i>12-point verification.</i>

01:18:26.953 --> 01:18:28.746
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:30.373
<i>Confirming authorization level.</i>

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:32.041
Well, you can never be too safe.

01:18:32.125 --> 01:18:33.167
<i><i>Access granted.</i></i>

01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:42.301
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:44.971
You really did it.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.889
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.709
Arriving in second position.

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:18.671
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:30.975
Proceeding to command position.

01:19:48.743 --> 01:19:50.369
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:54.373
All right, guys. I'm in position.

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:56.125
I'm gonna signal the ants.

01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:58.461
No, no, no, no, no!

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:00.922
Did you see that?

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:08.971
Assume formation.

01:20:09.055 --> 01:20:10.973
All right, you cute little crazies,

01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:12.767
let's fry these servers!

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:27.073
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:40.586
<i>Servers are fried.</i>

01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:42.880
Data backup completely erased.

01:20:42.964 --> 01:20:44.549
Heading to the particle chamber.

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:52.932
Hello, Dr. Cross.

01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:59.272
My associates have agreed
to your terms.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:00.523
Wonderful.

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:03.442
Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:05.111
They're representatives of Hydra.

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:06.529
They're not what they were.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.865
They're doing some interesting work.

01:21:08.948 --> 01:21:11.409
And I'm enjoying myself.

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:14.328
You tried to hide
your technology from me.

01:21:14.412 --> 01:21:16.372
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

01:21:20.293 --> 01:21:21.335
Wow.

01:21:22.003 --> 01:21:25.715
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming
a mile away,

01:21:25.798 --> 01:21:27.884
but I just figured it'd
be all pathetic and weak.

01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:29.468
Well, you figured wrong.

01:21:30.678 --> 01:21:32.013
I know this van.

01:21:33.431 --> 01:21:34.599
ATWbOdy home?

01:21:40.271 --> 01:21:41.439
All right, guys. I'm here.

01:21:46.027 --> 01:21:47.820
I'm setting the charges.

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:09.717
Great job, guys. I'll take it from here.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:21.437
<i>Good boy, Ant-them.</i>

01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:23.397
Final position.

01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:34.325
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:35.952
- Almost.
- No, you're not.

01:22:36.035 --> 01:22:37.495
- I'm getting close!
-No, you're not.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:43.793
San Francisco P.D.!

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:44.877
Out of the van!

01:22:45.503 --> 01:22:46.462
I know you're in there!

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:48.714
- Make it go faster.
-Dude, seriously.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:56.514
Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:57.598
So close.

01:22:58.391 --> 01:22:59.809
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!
-Freeze!

01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:01.519
There was a black guy
that looked exactly like me

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:03.521
who attacked us and put us
in the back of this disgusting van.

01:23:03.604 --> 01:23:05.064
- Get out of the van!
- Okay, I'm coming.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:06.941
Take it easy!

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:08.985
No, I will not move! Go now!

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:13.197
- Wait!
-What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

01:23:20.121 --> 01:23:21.122
Phew!

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:24.750
What? What?

01:23:26.419 --> 01:23:27.670
Hey, little guy.

01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:43.519
I always suspected you had
a suit stored away somewhere.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:44.562
Which begs the question,

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:46.814
who is the new Ant-Man?

01:23:46.897 --> 01:23:49.316
Who is the man that my beloved mentor

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.277
trusted even more than me?

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.781
Scott Lang.

01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:58.617
A martyr

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:01.162
who took on the system
and paid the price,

01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:04.832
losing his family and his only daughter
in the process.

01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:08.169
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:13.966
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:18.137
--And then he disappears magically,

01:24:19.305 --> 01:24:21.432
despite having no money to his name.

01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:24.185
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:30.316
The only thing that can rival my creation.

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:33.819
Darren, don't do this.

01:24:33.903 --> 01:24:35.946
If you sell to these men,

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:37.490
it's gonna be chaos.

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:38.949
I already have.

01:24:39.033 --> 01:24:40.493
And for twice the price,

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:42.578
thanks to you.

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:46.040
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate
an Avengers facility.

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:48.084
Thankfully, word travels fast.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:52.004
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

01:24:53.047 --> 01:24:54.423
They don't run on diesel.

01:24:54.507 --> 01:24:57.384
If you want the fuel,
you'll have to come to me.

01:24:58.552 --> 01:25:00.346
What do you call the only man

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:03.390
who can arm the most
powerful weapon in the world?

01:25:04.058 --> 01:25:06.685
The most powerful man in the world.

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:08.270
You proud of me yet?

01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:11.398
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

01:25:11.482 --> 01:25:15.194
It's been too late for a long time now.

01:25:16.153 --> 01:25:18.197
Darren!

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:20.449
What are you doing?

01:25:20.533 --> 01:25:23.702
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:25.538
This is not who you are.

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:28.457
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:38.843
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:43.222
You're right. I have to be the one to do it.

01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:47.101
Here we go.

01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:51.730
Drop your gun.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:57.278
You know, I came to the house
the other night to kill him,

01:25:57.361 --> 01:25:58.445
but you were there.

01:25:58.529 --> 01:26:02.032
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

01:26:02.116 --> 01:26:03.367
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:06.370
but I think I am now!

01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:08.539
Drop your gun now!

01:26:08.622 --> 01:26:12.001
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.223
43am

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.192
Hank, no.

01:26:36.275 --> 01:26:37.902
No, Hank.

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:40.487
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.

01:26:40.571 --> 01:26:42.031
- All right? You're gonna be just fine.

01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:46.535
Take the suit off,
or I'll blow your brains out and peel it off.

01:27:12.353 --> 01:27:14.230
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.

01:27:14.313 --> 01:27:15.814
Request immediate backup!

01:27:15.898 --> 01:27:17.149
Go, go, 90!

01:27:30.079 --> 01:27:31.956
Get me to the roof.

01:27:32.039 --> 01:27:33.290
And radio ahead.

01:27:33.374 --> 01:27:36.210
I want to make sure the helicopter
is ready to take off.

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:37.336
You two,

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:40.089
kill anything that comes out of that vault!

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:43.342
Dad, can you move?

01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:47.137
We need to get him out of here.

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:51.058
Go get that suit.

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:35.436
Hey, Scotty.

01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:37.229
Hey, did I save your life?

01:28:38.397 --> 01:28:39.481
Scotty?

01:28:39.565 --> 01:28:40.983
Scotty?

01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:44.987
Thank you, Luis.

01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:46.655
- Are we the good guys?
-Yeah.

01:28:46.739 --> 01:28:48.866
- We're the good guys, right?
-Yeah, we're the good guys.

01:28:49.533 --> 01:28:51.285
Feels kinda weird, you know.

01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:53.454
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:55.581
Get out of here before this place blows!

01:29:02.296 --> 01:29:05.549
Damn it! That guy.

01:29:06.717 --> 01:29:08.844
Hey! We're getting out of here!

01:29:13.349 --> 01:29:14.391
The charges are set.

01:29:14.475 --> 01:29:16.477
We've gotta find a way out of here.
And fast.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.479
Don't worry.

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:21.106
I'm not gonna die.

01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:22.649
And neither are you.

01:29:23.734 --> 01:29:26.236
It's not a keychain.

01:29:29.323 --> 01:29:32.284
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

01:29:43.087 --> 01:29:44.838
And there's a tank.

01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:55.974
A little help!

01:29:57.476 --> 01:29:58.602
I got it.

01:29:59.395 --> 01:30:00.854
We need a doctor!

01:30:02.147 --> 01:30:03.399
We've got him.

01:30:05.526 --> 01:30:07.152
Thank you.

01:30:08.487 --> 01:30:10.072
Let's go)!

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:27.506
Ant-thony!

01:30:40.853 --> 01:30:42.104
Go!

01:30:43.397 --> 01:30:44.565
You're gonna regret that.

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:56.577
Wait a minute! Get out of that van!

- What?
-Get out of that van!

I can't hear you!

Hey! Hey!

01:31:08.547 --> 01:31:10.841
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

01:31:10.924 --> 01:31:12.426
The windows!

01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:19.766
Did you think you could
stop the future with a heist?

01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:21.393
it was neverjust a heist!

01:31:43.582 --> 01:31:45.083
Put the gun down!

01:31:53.675 --> 01:31:55.802
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

01:32:12.069 --> 01:32:14.112

I am taking you back. To prison.

Hi, peanut.

- That's it.

01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:39.104
- Back it up.
- That's right.

- Backin' up?
- Yep, just backin' up.

01:37:42.065 --> 01:37:43.275
No, no. Just back it up.

01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:52.033
You insult me, Scott.

01:37:56.329 --> 01:38:00.125
Your very existence is insulting to me.

01:38:01.751 --> 01:38:05.338
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you
if you were bigger.

01:38:07.549 --> 01:38:08.842
Yeah, I agree.

01:39:27.712 --> 01:39:29.089
Sorry, sweetheart.

01:39:29.172 --> 01:39:31.591

-Okay.

Stay behind me.

Hank. I don't.

01:43:19.903 --> 01:43:22.280
There must be something else.

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:27.118
Well, I suppose the human mind

01:43:27.202 --> 01:43:29.871
just can't comprehend the experience,

01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:33.291
but you made it.

01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:35.585
You went in,

01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:38.671
and you got out.

01:43:40.882 --> 01:43:42.467
It's amazing.

01:43:43.176 --> 01:43:44.928
Scott,

01:44:22.048 --> 01:44:23.174
Nothing's happening.

01:44:23.258 --> 01:44:25.468
Whoa. Hold on.
Somethings kind of happening.

01:44:25.551 --> 01:44:27.595
Well, if that's the case,

01:44:27.679 --> 01:44:29.180
shoot me again.

01:44:29.555 --> 01:44:32.141
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,
grabbing and kissing me like that.

01:44:32.225 --> 01:44:34.143
I'm a little surprised myself.

01:44:34.227 --> 01:44:36.604
I have to get somewhere.
I'll see you later, Hank.

01:44:36.688 --> 01:44:38.147
Really, Hope.

01:44:38.982 --> 01:44:40.358
- Scott.
-Yeah?

01:44:40.942 --> 01:44:42.694
- You're full of shit.
-Oh, yeah.

01:44:44.112 --> 01:44:46.030
Scott,
I met with my captain today.

01:44:46.114 --> 01:44:48.783
He wanted a report on the night
that you got out ofjail.

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:50.743
Something happened with the cameras.

01:44:51.619 --> 01:44:53.788
Some circuits got fried.

01:44:54.914 --> 01:44:57.166
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

01:44:57.250 --> 01:44:58.376
Really?

01:44:58.459 --> 01:44:59.877
PAXTONI Well, yeah.

01:45:01.671 --> 01:45:04.590
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

01:45:04.674 --> 01:45:06.634
Thank you, Paxton.

01:45:06.718 --> 01:45:08.177
I'm blown away.

01:45:08.970 --> 01:45:10.763
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

01:45:10.847 --> 01:45:12.890
Well, that's my pleasure.

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:17.228
But, no. This one, I did for you.

01:45:19.272 --> 01:45:20.690
- This is awkward.
-Yeah.

01:45:20.773 --> 01:45:22.567
- Yeah.

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:24.110
I mean, what do we even talk about
after all of that?

01:45:24.193 --> 01:45:25.570
- Oh, I know.
-What?

01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:28.197
- I did my first cartwheel today.
-What?

01:45:28.281 --> 01:45:30.867
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:32.368
But today was the magic day.

01:45:32.452 --> 01:45:33.453
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

01:45:35.163 --> 01:45:37.498
No, that can't be Cassie.
That's not you.

01:45:37.582 --> 01:45:39.167
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, it is.

01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:41.377
This is a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

01:45:41.461 --> 01:45:42.587
Yeah, that's her.

01:45:43.546 --> 01:45:45.131
Good boy.

01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:49.761
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

01:45:52.722 --> 01:45:53.723
Sorry.

01:45:55.391 --> 01:45:57.101
It's work.

01:45:57.769 --> 01:45:59.020
Yeah.

01:46:00.772 --> 01:46:01.731
All right.

01:46:01.814 --> 01:46:03.566
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:04.942
Just the facts. Only the facts.

01:46:05.026 --> 01:46:08.905
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

01:46:08.988 --> 01:46:10.656
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:13.117
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

01:46:13.201 --> 01:46:15.411
<i>And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.</i>

01:46:15.495 --> 01:46:17.705
<i>But you know me, I'm more
like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?</i>

01:46:17.789 --> 01:46:20.500
<i>But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!</i>

01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:22.710
- Luis.
-Okay, sorry. Sorry.

01:46:22.794 --> 01:46:24.796
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

01:46:24.879 --> 01:46:26.839
<i>But anyway, Ignacio tells me,</i>

01:46:26.923 --> 01:46:30.551
<i>"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.</i>

01:46:30.635 --> 01:46:33.012
<i>"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he
goes up to the bartender and goes,</i>

01:46:33.096 --> 01:46:34.764
<i>"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

01:46:34.847 --> 01:46:36.099
<i>"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"</i>

01:46:36.182 --> 01:46:38.851
<i>The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."</i>

01:46:38.935 --> 01:46:40.853
<i>So this writer chick tells Ignacio,</i>

01:46:40.937 --> 01:46:43.731
<i>"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,</i>

01:46:43.815 --> 01:46:45.525
<i>"and I got mad connects
with the peeps behind the curtains,</i>

01:46:45.608 --> 01:46:46.567
<i>"you know what I'm saying?"</i>

01:46:46.651 --> 01:46:48.152
<i>lgnacio's like, "For real?"</i>

01:46:48.236 --> 01:46:51.197
<i>And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,
I can't tell you who my contact is,</i>

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.657
<i>"because he works with the Avengers."</i>

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:54.033
Oh, no.

01:46:54.117 --> 01:46:56.536
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

01:46:56.619 --> 01:46:57.745
Like, he comes up to her and says,

01:46:57.829 --> 01:46:59.872
<i>"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,</i>

01:46:59.956 --> 01:47:01.082
<i>"who's flashing his fresh tack,</i>

01:47:01.165 --> 01:47:03.709
<i>"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"</i>

01:47:03.793 --> 01:47:06.921
<i>And she's like, "Well, we got everything
nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.</i>

01:47:07.004 --> 01:47:09.090
<i>"We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who crawls up the walls.</i>

01:47:09.173 --> 01:47:10.883
<i>"You gotta be more specific."</i>

01:47:10.967 --> 01:47:12.802
<i>And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."</i>

01:47:12.885 --> 01:47:16.305
And I'm, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

01:47:16.389 --> 01:47:17.432
So I asked Ignacio,

01:47:17.515 --> 01:47:19.559
<i>"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick</i>

01:47:19.642 --> 01:47:21.894
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

01:47:21.978 --> 01:47:23.187
"that he's looking for him?"

01:47:23.855 --> 01:47:26.399
And? What'd he say?

01:47:29.694 --> 01:47:31.112
He said, "Yes."

01:49:26.185 --> 01:49:28.479
There's something I want to show you.

01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:33.943
I realized you can't destroy power.

01:49:35.653 --> 01:49:39.574
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

01:49:46.289 --> 01:49:48.416
This is an advanced prototype

01:49:48.499 --> 01:49:51.377
that your mother and I
worked on together.

01:49:52.753 --> 01:49:55.464
She never got to use it.

01:49:56.132 --> 01:50:00.511
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

01:50:07.143 --> 01:50:09.687
Maybe it's time we finished it.

01:50:16.319 --> 01:50:18.738
It's about damn time.

01:56:19.056 --> 01:56:20.432
<i>FALCON". Hey, Cap!</i>

01:56:33.654 --> 01:56:37.157
This would have been a lot easier
a week ago.

01:56:37.241 --> 01:56:39.159
- If we call Tony...
-He won't believe us.

01:56:39.243 --> 01:56:40.244
Even if he did...

01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:42.037
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:45.124
We're on our own.

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:47.835
Maybe not.

01:56:50.129 --> 01:56:51.547
I know a guy.
