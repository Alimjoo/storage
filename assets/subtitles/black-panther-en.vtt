15:52.650 --> 15:54.620
波波阿尚蒂部落

15:54.720 --> 15:55.920
在如今的加纳

不对
Nah.

16:22.380 --> 16:23.610

but it's from Wakanda.

16:27.150 --> 16:29.060

16:35.390 --> 16:37.460
这些文物是不出售的

How do you think your ancestors got these?

16:40.140 --> 16:41.690
你觉得他们是付了公道的价钱买下的吗
You think they paid a fair price?

16:41.710 --> 16:44.380
还是他们夺走的 就像其他一切他们夺走的东西
Or did they take it, like they took everything else?

16:44.540 --> 16:47.660
先生 我得请你离开了
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

16:47.890 --> 16:51.050
这么多的保安 从我走进来就一直盯着我

你可以走 但别告诉任何人 好吗
You can go, but just don't tell anyone, all right?

哥们 你怎么不直接打死他
Bro, why you aingt just shoot him right here?

17:45.050 --> 17:47.800
因为让犯罪现场分散开一点会更好
Because it's better to leave the crime scene more spread out.

17:47.970 --> 17:49.650
让我们显得业余
Makes us look like amateurs.

18:00.270 --> 18:02.220

18:37.220 --> 18:38.960

我可以一石二鸟
I can kill two birds with one stone.

18:47.370 --> 18:49.350

You're not telling me that's vibranium, too?

32:00.060 --> 32:02.380

32:06.300 --> 32:09.150

32:10.730 --> 32:13.610
没有让孩子准备好
A man who has not prepared his children

32:13.640 --> 32:15.210
面对他死亡的人
for his own death

32:15.510 --> 32:17.260
是个失败的父亲

32:17.790 --> 32:20.580
我辜负过你吗

32:21.060 --> 32:22.090

32:49.260 --> 32:52.040

And it's hard for a good man to be king.

32:56.230 --> 32:57.380
呼吸

32:58.640 --> 33:00.890

33:42.170 --> 33:43.450

33:43.490 --> 33:44.810
但我不能留下
But I can't stay.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.770
我在外面世界里找到了自己的使命
It's just, I found my calling out there.

33:49.540 --> 33:52.650
我见到了太多贫困的人 不能再视而不见
I've seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.370
我在这里开心不起来
I can't be happy here

33:54.410 --> 33:57.340
因为我知道外面世界里还有一无所有的人
knowing that there's people out there who have nothing.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.620
那你希望瓦坎达做点什么
What would you have Wakanda do about it?

34:02.100 --> 34:03.510

其他国家也这么做 我们能做得更好
Other countries do it, we could do it better.

34:12.280 --> 34:15.440
我们跟其他国家不一样 娜吉雅
We are not like these other countries, Nakia .

34:16.230 --> 34:18.330
如果世界得知了我们真正的样子
If the world found out what we truly are,

34:18.360 --> 34:19.730
我们拥有什么
what we possess,

34:19.990 --> 34:21.700
我们可能会失去现在的生活
we could lose our way of life.

34:21.740 --> 34:23.940
瓦坎达有足够的力量帮助他人
Wakanda is strong enough to help others

34:23.980 --> 34:25.860
并保护自己
and protect ourselves at the same time.

34:27.850 --> 34:30.850
如果你不是这么固执 本可以当个好王后
If you were not so stubborn, you would make a great queen.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.580
正因为我固执 我才能当个好王后
I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn.

34:33.700 --> 34:36.420
- 承认了吧 - 如果我想当王后的话
- See, you admit it! - If that's what I wanted.

34:44.370 --> 34:45.500
那是它吗
Is that him?

34:48.040 --> 34:51.270
芭丝特保佑 它还在长吗

34:52.170 --> 34:53.120
当然
Of course.

34:54.430 --> 34:56.240

瓦坎达人 他们来了
Wakandans! They're here!

47:06.470 --> 47:07.950
- 快走 - 杀光他们
- Get outta here! - Kill 'em all!

47:09.620 --> 47:11.150
快去拿钻石
Diamonds, quick!

48:07.870 --> 48:09.140
杀人犯
Murderer!

48:13.880 --> 48:14.910
知道吗
You know,

48:15.500 --> 48:17.760
你跟你老子真像
you look just like your old man.

48:27.450 --> 48:28.920
我撒钱雨了
I made it rain!

48:30.100 --> 48:31.300
我们走吧 老大
Let's get out of here, boss!

48:35.490 --> 48:38.370
太爽了 太爽了
That was awesome! That was awesome!

48:38.570 --> 48:40.720
走吧 开车 快走
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

48:43.010 --> 48:45.230
- 我们丢下他吗 - 他会追上来的
- Do we just leave him? - He'll catch up.

48:53.640 --> 48:54.620
苏睿
Shuri!

48:58.380 --> 48:59.420
太好了
Yes!

48:59.650 --> 49:02.000
遥控驾驶系统已启动
Remote driving system activated.

49:02.730 --> 49:04.740
等等 这是左驾还是右驾
Wait! Which side of the road is it?

49:04.760 --> 49:06.410
看在芭丝特的分上 开吧
For Bast's sake! Just drive!

49:06.440 --> 49:07.750
好啦 冷静点
Okay, calm down!

49:16.230 --> 49:17.460
走咯
Let's go!

49:17.530 --> 49:19.590
放点音乐 你当这是送葬啊
Put some music on. What do you think this is, a funeral?

49:23.460 --> 49:24.840
哪辆是他
Which one is he in now?

49:26.920 --> 49:28.160
分头走
Hey, split up!

49:29.860 --> 49:32.350
- 他们想甩掉我们 - 我追右边那个
- They're trying to lose us. - I'll take the right.

49:33.920 --> 49:36.770
我们追另两个 我看到条近路
We'll take the other two! I see a shortcut.

49:52.700 --> 49:54.200
我们过不去的
We're not going to make it!

49:55.480 --> 49:56.500
继续开
Keep going!

50:03.890 --> 50:04.970
老哥
Brother!

50:14.360 --> 50:15.320
那是什么
Hey, what was that?

50:15.350 --> 50:17.410
别想了 你棒棒哒
Don't worry about it. You're doing great.

50:29.280 --> 50:30.410
枪
Guns.

50:31.610 --> 50:32.760
真原始
So primitive!

50:32.790 --> 50:35.010
那是振金车 白痴
It's a vibranium car, you idiots!

50:35.040 --> 50:36.810
子弹打不透的
The bullets won't penetrate!

50:38.510 --> 50:39.520
你干什么
What are you doing?

50:39.540 --> 50:40.840
开你的车
Just drive.

50:58.030 --> 50:59.070
该死
Shit!

51:12.290 --> 51:13.860
看你的战服
Look at your suit.

51:13.960 --> 51:15.120
你挨了好多子弹
You've been taking bullets,

51:15.150 --> 51:17.090
战服积蓄了不少动能
charging it up with kinetic energy.

51:19.030 --> 51:20.450
绕到卡车另一边
Pull around the truck.

51:25.080 --> 51:26.170
他哪去了
Where'd he go?

51:35.710 --> 51:37.030
臭显摆
You show-off.

51:38.170 --> 51:39.420
他在那里
There he is!

51:41.640 --> 51:42.700
抓紧了
Hold tight!

51:46.440 --> 51:47.980
好 我们玩玩吧
All right. Let's have some fun!

52:16.060 --> 52:16.960
跳上来
Hop in.

52:17.510 --> 52:19.630
把矛放后备箱里吧
Put that spear in the trunk.

52:25.170 --> 52:26.180
再快点 苏睿
Faster, Shuri.

52:26.210 --> 52:28.150
我已经开到最快了
I'm going as fast as I can!

52:29.660 --> 52:31.020
右转 右转
Take a right! Take a right!

52:35.470 --> 52:36.870
不 不 不
No, no, no!

52:39.360 --> 52:40.370
老哥
Brother!

53:03.600 --> 53:04.920
克劳
Klaue!

53:06.490 --> 53:08.390
你以为我们会忘记吗
Did you think we would forget?

53:17.550 --> 53:19.370
看着我 杀人犯
Look at me, murderer!

53:20.380 --> 53:22.140
这武器你从哪弄来的
Where did you get this weapon?

53:22.210 --> 53:24.410
你们这些野蛮人不配拥有它
You savages didn't deserve it.

53:27.090 --> 53:30.690
饶命啊 陛下 饶命
Oh, mercy, king. Mercy.

53:30.790 --> 53:33.120
你喘的每一口气都是我仁慈的体现
Every breath you take is mercy from me.

53:33.160 --> 53:34.490
陛下
King!

53:35.030 --> 53:36.640
世界在看着呢
The world watches.

53:37.100 --> 53:39.180
来吧 几位 我们快走吧
Come on. Guys. Let's go, huh?

53:45.240 --> 53:46.090
嗯
Yeah.

54:00.550 --> 54:01.650
有人吗
Hello.

54:04.650 --> 54:07.480
我看得到你们 真的
I can see you! I can. I can see you.

54:15.780 --> 54:17.380
真是闹得好大
So this is a big mess, huh?

54:17.700 --> 54:20.060
我们不如唱红脸白脸
I figured we could go good cop, bad cop.

54:20.140 --> 54:21.440
我先进去跟他谈 然后你们去
I'll talk to him first, then you guys go in.

54:21.460 --> 54:24.600
我们不能让他单独跟克劳谈
We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.

54:28.180 --> 54:31.170
最好让他单独跟克劳谈5分钟
Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes

54:31.230 --> 54:33.700
别在这里闹不愉快
than to make a scene here.

54:35.370 --> 54:36.430
等你审问过他
After your questioning,

54:36.450 --> 54:38.490
我们要带他回瓦坎达
we will take him back to Wakanda with us.

54:38.530 --> 54:39.320
什么 不行
What? No.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.190
我很喜欢你
Look, I like you, a lot.

54:41.680 --> 54:44.430
但他已经被我缉拿 他哪里都不去
But he's in my custody now. He's not going anywhere.

54:44.590 --> 54:46.140
听着 我光是允许你们来
Listen, I'm doing you guys a favor

54:46.180 --> 54:48.040
就是给你们面子了
by letting you even be in here.

54:50.180 --> 54:52.700
他再敢碰你一次
If he touches you again,

54:52.800 --> 54:55.690
我就把他插在那个桌子上
I'm going to impale him to this desk.

54:56.670 --> 54:57.970
她会说英语吗
Does she speak english?

54:58.410 --> 55:00.000
她想说就说
When she wants to.

55:01.930 --> 55:02.900
我进去了
I'm going in.

55:02.950 --> 55:05.350
等我问完了 你们再上
When I'm done, you guys are up.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.210
- 罗斯特工 - 怎么
- Agent Ross. - Yeah?

55:07.880 --> 55:10.650
我很感谢你在釜山的帮助
I do appreciate your help in Busan.

55:11.330 --> 55:12.430
瞧见没
You see that?

55:13.050 --> 55:14.500
这叫外交
It's called diplomacy.

55:15.510 --> 55:16.650
不客气
You're welcome.

55:18.700 --> 55:20.050
奥克耶
Okoye.

55:20.740 --> 55:21.910
客气点
Play nice.

55:21.970 --> 55:23.150
美国人啊
Americans.

55:23.270 --> 55:26.580
不要再伤害我
Don't hurt me no more

55:26.880 --> 55:28.440
爱是什么
What is love?

55:28.480 --> 55:30.780
宝贝 别再伤害我
Baby, don't hurt me

55:30.860 --> 55:33.900
不要再伤害我
Don't hurt me no more

55:35.220 --> 55:37.250
你不该相信那些瓦坎达人
You know, you really shouldn't trust the Wakandans.

55:37.300 --> 55:38.690
我跟你才是一类人
I'm much more your speed.

55:38.750 --> 55:40.710
我干这行 谁都不信任
I don't trust anybody, not in this job.

55:40.760 --> 55:43.560
但我对外面那个手臂炮感兴趣
But what I am interested in is that arm cannon out there.

55:43.590 --> 55:44.400
那是哪来的
Where'd you get that?

55:44.440 --> 55:46.540
就是被我调试过的旧采矿工具
It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to.

55:46.560 --> 55:48.790
但如果你要 我可以给你弄一个
But I can get you one, if you like.

55:48.840 --> 55:50.800
你何不说出你供货商的名字
Why don't you give me the name of your supplier,

55:50.850 --> 55:52.130
我直接去找他们要
and I'll ask them.

55:52.170 --> 55:53.690
他就在外面
He's right outside.

55:53.790 --> 55:55.540
你自己去问他好了
Why don't you ask him yourself?

55:55.600 --> 55:57.000
什么 特查拉吗
What? T'Challa?

55:57.340 --> 56:00.690
你是说你手臂上的武器是瓦坎达来的
You're telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda?

56:01.140 --> 56:02.040
对了
Bingo.

56:03.030 --> 56:06.200
你对瓦坎达究竟有什么了解
What do you actually know about Wakanda?

56:08.710 --> 56:10.820
牧羊 纺织 衣服很酷
Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits.

56:10.900 --> 56:12.570
那都是幌子
It's all a front.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.260
探索者找了那里几个世纪
Explorers searched for it for centuries.

56:15.410 --> 56:18.190
传说中的黄金城
El dorado, the golden city.

56:18.300 --> 56:20.420
他们以为是在南美洲
They thought they could find it in South America,

56:20.480 --> 56:23.530
但其实本就是在非洲
but it was in Africa the whole time.

56:23.800 --> 56:25.740
一个科技奇迹
A technological marvel.

56:25.780 --> 56:27.320
就因为这个国家脚下
All because it was built

56:27.370 --> 56:30.390
就是世上最珍惜的金属
on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man.

56:30.540 --> 56:33.790
他们称之为"天赐"
Isipho, they call it. The gift.

56:34.180 --> 56:35.310
就是振金
Vibranium.

56:35.370 --> 56:37.710
振金 嗯 地球上最坚硬的金属
Vibranium, yeah, strongest metal on earth.

56:37.750 --> 56:39.060
不仅仅是金属
It's not just a metal.

56:39.100 --> 56:41.390
他们把它缝进衣服里
They sew it into their clothes.

56:41.490 --> 56:44.480
用它为城市供能 开发科技
It powers their city, their tech,

56:44.840 --> 56:46.320
制造武器
their weapons.

56:46.890 --> 56:47.700
武器
Weapons?

56:47.750 --> 56:48.650
是的
Yeah.

56:48.680 --> 56:51.560
我的手臂炮相比之下就像吹叶机
Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower.

56:51.590 --> 56:52.880
这真是个美丽的童话
That's a nice fairy tale,

56:52.920 --> 56:54.930
但瓦坎达是个第三世界国家
but Wakanda is a third world country,

56:54.950 --> 56:57.470
而且你把他们的振金都偷走了
and you stole all their vibranium.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.320
我偷…
I stole...

57:02.440 --> 57:03.790
我都偷走了
All of it?

57:04.920 --> 57:07.780
我拿的不过九牛一毛
I took a tiny piece of it.

57:07.850 --> 57:09.500
他们还有整整一山的
They have a mountain full of it.

57:09.530 --> 57:11.870
他们已经开采了数千年
They've been mining it for thousands of years...

57:11.910 --> 57:14.270
却还只是触及了矿藏的表层
And they still haven't scratched the surface.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.370
我是唯一见到了真相
I'm the only outsider who's seen it

57:16.400 --> 57:18.270
还活着出来的外人
and got out of there alive.

57:18.450 --> 57:19.480
如果你不信
If you don't believe me,

57:19.530 --> 57:23.450
你去问问你的朋友 他的战服是什么做的
you ask your friend what his suit is made of.

57:23.530 --> 57:25.920
他的爪子是什么做的
What his claws are made of.

57:48.950 --> 57:50.790
你父亲对联合国说
Your father told the UN

57:51.060 --> 57:53.570
克劳盗走了你们全部的振金
that Klaue stole all the vibranium you had.

57:53.610 --> 57:55.590
但现在他却说你们还有
But now he's telling me you have more.

57:55.800 --> 57:57.060
你相信一个
And you believe the word

57:57.100 --> 58:00.030
捆在椅子上的军火贩的话吗
of an arms dealer strapped to a chair?

58:17.290 --> 58:18.680
这是哪里
Where is that?

58:20.690 --> 58:22.010
后面
Back there.

58:34.260 --> 58:35.890
你们还藏了多少
How much more are you hiding?

58:37.190 --> 58:39.220
外面有情况
Something is happening out back.

58:45.110 --> 58:46.010
趴下
Get down!

58:51.280 --> 58:52.350
别动
Stand down!

58:55.580 --> 58:56.630
找掩护
Cover!

58:56.790 --> 58:57.850
手雷
Grenade!

59:01.060 --> 59:03.260
你们还真是不紧不慢啊
I see you took your time, didn't you?

59:23.210 --> 59:24.580
陛下
My king!

59:26.480 --> 59:28.590
陛下
My king.

59:29.150 --> 59:30.330
娜吉雅
Nakia.

59:33.110 --> 59:35.300
他替我挡了子弹
He just jumped in front of me.

59:37.960 --> 59:39.340
他在这里是治不好的
I don't think he'll make it here.

59:39.390 --> 59:41.120
子弹击中了脊椎
It hit his spine.

59:43.540 --> 59:45.200
给我一颗灵珠
Give me a kimoyo bead.

59:49.280 --> 59:51.860
这能暂时稳定他的情况
This will stabilize him for now.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.900
把他交给我们
Give him to us.

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:03.280
我们可以救他
We can save him.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.790
我们的任务是抓克劳回去
Our mission was to bring back Klaue.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.210
我们失败了
We failed.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.720
此人还是外国情报人员
This man is a foreign intelligence operative.

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:23.170
我们要如何解释带他进入国境内
How do we justify bringing him into our borders?

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.870
他替我挡了子弹
He took a bullet for me.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.920
那是他的选择
That was his choice.

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:29.190
那我们就要任由他死去吗
So now we are just supposed to let him die?

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:31.380
想想看 如果我们治好了他
Let us consider that we heal him.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.210
他有责任向他的国家汇报情况
It is his duty to report back to his country.

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.990
作为国王 你则有责任保护我们国家
And as king, it is your duty to protect ours.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.690
我很清楚我的职责 将军
I'm well aware of my duties, general.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:44.200
我不能任他死去
I cannot just let him die,

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:46.910
而我们明明能救他
knowing we can save him.

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.830
我们究竟要带他去哪
Where exactly are we taking him?

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.550
好啊 又带来个受伤的白人让我们治
Great! Another broken white boy for us to fix.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.290
这会很好玩的
This is going to be fun.

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:10.840
他不会有事的
He will live.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.450
瓦卡比来了
W'Kabi is here.

01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:28.010
怎么回事 兄弟 克劳呢
What's going on, brother? Where is Klaue?

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.940
他不在
He's not here.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.310
他从我们掌心里溜走了
He slipped through our hands.

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:38.930
"溜走了"
"Slipped"?

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.480
你父亲掌权30年 什么都没做
For 30 years, your father was in power and did nothing.

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.930
我以为你会有所不同
With you, I thought it'd be different.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.700
但看来还是那样
But it's more of the same.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.080
我们走吧 老大
Let's get going, boss.

01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:14.880
你总卖给中情局吗
You always sell to the CIA?

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.770
我卖给出价最高者
I sell to the highest bidder.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.460
别担心 等我回了约翰内斯堡
But don't you worry. When I get back to Joburg,

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:20.730
避过了这阵风头
and I lay low for a bit,

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:22.580
我会让你俩拿到工钱的
I'll make sure both you guys get paid.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.040
我才不担心钱的事呢
I aingt worried about the money, bro.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.270
我知道你拿得出
I know you good for it.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.000
回去的路上 把我们丢在瓦坎达就好
On our way back, just drop us off in Wakanda.

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:29.250
你可不想去那里 小子
You don't want to go there, boy.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.290
我想去
Yeah, I do.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.340
放下
Drop it!

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:37.720
否则你们雌雄大盗的组合 今天就解散
Or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today.

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:39.700
马上放下枪
Put your gun down now!

01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:41.120
对不起
I'm sorry.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.440
- 对不起 埃里克 - 没事的
- Sorry, Erik. - It's gonna be okay.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.590
你真想去瓦坎达
You really want to go to Wakanda?

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:17.230
他们都是野蛮人
They're savages.

01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:21.290
他们就这么对我们这样的人
This is what they do to people like us.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.780
我可不怕烙印
I aingt worried about no brand.

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:23.930
看这个
Check these out.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.230
每个都代表我杀的一个人
Each one is for a kill.

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:30.170
你怎么伤害自己无所谓
You can scar yourself as much as you'd like.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.000
在他们看来 你始终是个外人
To them, you'll just be an outsider.

01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:35.810
你要是以为自己能走进去就是疯了
You're crazy to think that you can walk in there.

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:46.070
我还当你是个疯子美国人呢
To think I saw you as some crazy American.

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:00.820
下去
Leave us!

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.350
你的任务未能如愿
So your mission did not go as planned.

01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:20.070
我叔叔尼乔布究竟发生了什么
What happened to my uncle N'Jobu?

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:23.600
我父亲说他失踪了
My father told me he disappeared.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.370
今天有个男人
There was a man today,

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:30.920
戴了跟这枚一样的戒指
wearing a ring identical to this one.

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.790
那不可能
That is not possible.

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:38.700
他帮助了克劳逃脱 而且他戴了这枚戒指
He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring!

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.890
我爷爷的戒指
My grandfather's ring!

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:42.720
别告诉我什么可能不可能
Do not tell me what is possible.

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:44.250
告诉我真相
Tell me the truth!

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:50.270
有些真相
Some truths...

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:56.210
太过沉重 特查拉
Are too much to bear, T'Challa.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:00.140
那不是由你来决定
That is not your choice to make.

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.990
他究竟怎么了
What happened to him?

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:03.530
我向国王保证过不会说的
I promised the king to say nothing.

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:05.530
现在我是你的国王了
I'am your king now!

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.600
你叔叔接受了
Your uncle took...

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.380
去美国做战士的任务
A war dog assignment in America.

01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:32.770
你父亲
Your father...

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.580
把我安插在了那里
Placed me there...

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.620
观察他
To observe...

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.520
而他并不知情
Unbeknownst to him.

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:43.910
你叔叔爱上了个美国女人
Your uncle fell in love with an American woman.

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:45.910
他们生了个孩子
They had a child.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.740
他在那里看到的困苦
The hardships he saw there...

01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:52.790
让他变得激进
Radicalized your uncle.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.350
我袖手旁观了很久
I observed for as long as I could.

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.200
他们的领袖遭人暗杀
Their leaders have been assassinated.

01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:00.770
他们的社区被毒品和武器淹没
Communities flooded with drugs and weapons.

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:03.610
他们遭受警察暴力 执法过度
They are overly policed and incarcerated.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.420
在世界各地
All over the planet

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.750
我们的同胞饱受苦难
our people suffer because

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:09.370
就因为他们没有反抗的能力
they don't have the tools to fight back.

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.210
如果有了振金武器
With vibranium weapons,

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.920
他们可以推翻每一个国家
they could overthrow every country,

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:14.790
瓦坎达可以一统天下
and Wakanda could rule them all

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:16.050
好好治理
the right way.

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:20.040
他知道你父亲绝不会答应
He knew your father would not support this.

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.830
所以 你叔叔背叛了我们
So, your uncle betrayed us.

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.020
不
No!

01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:28.620
他帮助克劳盗取了振金
He helped Klaue steal the vibranium.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.970
不 不
No, no, no.

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:33.580
你要马上回国
You will return home at once...

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:35.380
并面见议会
Where you will face the council...

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:38.170
向他们坦白你的罪行
And inform them of your crimes.

01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:40.480
他举起枪对准了我
He drew his weapon on me.

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:41.470
不
No!

01:06:57.910 --> 01:07:01.190
你父亲杀了亲弟弟
Your father killed his own brother...

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.420
救了我的命
to save my life.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.690
决不许说出去
Speak nothing of this.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.370
那孩子呢
And the child?

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.730
我们丢下了他
We left him.

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:33.660
我们必须
We had to...

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.970
守住
maintain...

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.660
那个谎言
the lie.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.410
这是什么
What is this?

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.430
只是一份薄礼
Just a little gift.

01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:31.320
你是谁
Who are you?

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:23.130
好吧 我在哪
All right, where am l?

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.040
别那么吓我 殖民者
Don't scare me like that, colonizer!

01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:28.340
什么 我叫埃弗雷特
What? My name is Everett.

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:31.470
我知道 埃弗雷特·罗斯
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.400
前空军飞行员 现中情局特工
Former air force pilot and now CIA.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.010
没错
Right.

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:42.370
好吧 这是瓦坎达吗
Okay, is this Wakanda?

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:44.070
不 是堪萨斯
No, it's Kansas.

01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:48.980
韩国是多久之前了
How long ago was Korea?

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.210
昨天
Yesterday.

01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:51.220
不可能
I don't think so.

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.990
枪伤不会魔法般地一夜恢复
Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight.

01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:56.250
在这里可以
They do here.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.080
但不是靠魔法 是靠科技
But not by magic, by technology.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.210
什么都别碰 我哥哥很快就会回来
Don't touch anything. My brother will return soon.

01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:32.990
这些火车
These train things...

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.720
是磁悬浮的吧
That's magnetic levitation, right?

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.040
当然了
Obviously.

01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:41.580
当然了 但我从没见过这么高效的
Obviously, but I've never seen it this efficient.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.460
那个灯板 是干什么的
The light panels, what are they?

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:48.050
- 声波稳定器 - 什么
- Sonic stabilizers. - Sonic what?

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:51.230
未加工的振金太过危险
In its raw form vibranium is too dangerous

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.910
不能高速运输
to be transported at that speed,

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.460
所以我发明了一种办法让它暂时失效
so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.150
那些火车上是振金
There's vibranium on those trains?

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:01.710
我们周围到处是振金
There's vibranium all around us.

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:04.750
我就是靠这个治好了你
That's how I healed you.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.370
特查拉呢
Where is T'Challa?

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:16.550
他的灵珠被关闭了
His kimoyo beads have been switched off.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.920
我们又不是连体婴 奥克耶
Well, we are not joined at the hip, Okoye.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.970
有个男人出现在了边境 自称杀了克劳
A man showed up at the border who claims to have killed Klaue.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:22.750
什么
What?

01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:25.320
瓦卡比此刻正在送他去王宫
W'Kabi is transporting him, as we speak, to the palace.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.570
我们得找到你哥哥
We need to find your brother!

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:28.780
一个外人吗
An outsider?

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.390
不 是瓦坎达人
No, a Wakandan.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.270
他不是瓦坎达人
He's not a Wakandan.

01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:36.020
他是我们的人
He's one of ours.

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:50.910
他杀了亲弟弟
He killed his own brother...

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:53.200
还丢下了一个孩子
And left a child behind...

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:54.720
让他一无所有
with nothing.

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.220
什么样的国王
What kind of king...

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.410
什么样的人会做出这种事
What kind of man does that?

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:04.650
人无完人
No man is perfect.

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.910
你父亲也是
Not even your father.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.960
他都没好好安葬他
He didn't even give him a proper burial.

01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:14.910
我叔叔尼乔布背叛了我们 但我父亲
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us, but my father...

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.860
他可能制造了更可怕的东西
He may have created something even worse.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.710
看着我
Look at me.

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:29.660
你不能让你父亲的错误决定你的为人
You can't let your father's mistakes define who you are.

01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:36.130
你才能决定你要做怎样的国王
You get to decide what kind of king you are going to be.

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.740
哥哥 你得马上回来
Brother, you need to get here now!

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.380
埃里克·斯蒂文斯
Erik Stevens.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.120
19岁从安纳波利斯毕业
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:51.210
在麻省理工学院攻读硕士

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:53.480
之后加入海豹突击队 去了阿富汗
Joined the SEALs and went straight to Afghanistan,

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.180
在那里杀人无数
where he wrapped up confirmed kills,

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:56.810
好像在打电子游戏
like it was a video game.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.610
开始有了杀人魔头的称号
Started calling him killmonger.

01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:00.230
他加入了一个联合特种作战司令部的秘密部队
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:01.650
他们可不是闹着玩的
Now these guys are serious.

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.850
他们会隐藏起来
They will drop off the grid,

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:03.980
进行刺杀
so they can commit assassinations

01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:05.650
颠覆政府
and take down governments.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.530
他有透露过他的身份吗
Did he reveal anything about his identity?

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.950
他有战士纹身
He has a war dog tattoo,

01:13:12.090 --> 01:13:14.610
但我们并无他的记录
but we have no record of him.

01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:23.460
这人到底是不是瓦坎达人
Is this man Wakandan or not?

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.890
告诉我们究竟怎么回事
Tell us what is going on.

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:46.800
说吧
Speak.

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:48.410
说吧
Speak.

01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:52.120
我来到了你的领地
I'm standing in your house,

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.550
处决了一个 盗走你们振金 还杀了你们人的罪人
serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people.

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.330
这是你们国王没能做到的
Justice your king couldn't deliver.

01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:06.720
我不管你是不是带来了克劳
I don't care that you brought Klaue.

01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:09.140
我之所以没有就地杀了你
Only reason I don't kill you where you stand

01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:11.490
是因为我知道你的身份
is because I know who you are.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.350
你想怎么样
Now, what do you want?

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:17.120
我想要王位
I want the throne.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.610
天呐
My goodness.

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:24.600
你们都安安稳稳地坐在这里
Y'all sitting up here comfortable.

01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:27.030
感觉很不错吧
Must feel good.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:31.420
全世界还有20亿跟我们一样黑皮肤的人
It's about two billion people all over the world that looks like us.

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.630
但他们的生活要艰辛得多
But their lives are a lot harder.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.010
瓦坎达有解放他们所有人的工具
Wakanda has the tools to liberate 'em all.

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:38.590
什么工具呢
And what tools are those?

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.780
振金 你们的武器
Vibranium. Your weapons.

01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:45.540
我们的武器绝不会用来向世界发动战争
Our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.290
我们不会去评判外人的行为
It is not our way to be judge, jury and executioner

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.750
并决定赏罚
for people who are not our own.

01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:53.320
外人
Not your own?

01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:55.990
但生命不是在这个大陆上诞生的吗
But didn't life start right here on this continent?

01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:57.570
那么所有人不都该是你的同胞吗
So aingt all people your people?

01:14:57.630 --> 01:15:01.710
我不是所有人的国王 我是瓦坎达的国王
Iam not king of all people. I am king of Wakanda.

01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:04.200
我的职责就是
And it is my responsibility

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.370
保证人民的安全
to make sure our people are safe

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:07.880
并确保振金
and that vibranium

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.770
不会落入你这种人手中
does not fall into the hands of a person like you.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.700

As the son of prince N'Jobu,

01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:23.630
他有权利这么做
he is within his rights.

他在这里没有任何权利

01:16:25.050 --> 01:16:27.490
挑战要准备数周
The challenge will take weeks to prepare.

01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:30.300

这就是你们的国王吗
Is this your king?

01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:16.830
黑豹
The black panther,

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.970
他还要带领你们进入未来

01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:20.620

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.130
我们得立刻去找她们
We should get to them immediately.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.100
我不能去
I cannot.

01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:48.460
- 什么 - 虽然我的心与你们同在
- What? - Though my heart is with you.

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.130
我们不能把这个国家交给一个
We cannot turn over our nation to a man

01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:54.130
几小时前才到来的男人
who showed up here only hours ago.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.240
他是王室血脉
He is of royal blood.

01:22:55.290 --> 01:22:57.750
- 他杀了特查拉 - 那是仪式格斗
- He killed T'Challa! - In ritual combat.

01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:59.400
那真的要紧吗
Does that really matter?

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:05.230
你是瓦坎达最伟大的战士
You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has.

01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:09.570
帮我推翻他 别让他羽翼丰满起来
Help me overthrow him before he becomes too strong.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.820
推翻
Overthrow?

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:12.720
娜吉雅
Nakia!

01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:17.470
我不是个可以自由来去的探子
I'm not a spy who can come and go as they so choose!

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.020
我要忠于王位 不管坐在上面的是谁
I am loyal to that throne, no matter who sits upon it.

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:25.570
你忠于什么
What are you loyal to?

01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:30.210
我爱他
I loved him.

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.710
我也爱我的国家
I loved my country, too.

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:36.410
那你就该效忠国家
Then you serve your country.

01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:39.490
不 我要救我的国家
No. I save my country.

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:49.670
怎么了
What's wrong?

01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:51.420
国王死了
The king is dead.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:55.110
跟我来 除非你也想一起死
Come with me, unless you want to join him.

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.170
先是爸爸
First Baba.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.230
现在又是我哥哥
And now my brother.

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:25.060
妈妈 我们都不能安葬他
Mama, we didn't even get to bury him.

01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:33.740
- 是我 - 娜吉雅
- It's me. - Nakia.

01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:35.180
这人是谁
Who is this man?

01:24:35.210 --> 01:24:37.510
他是特查拉的朋友 他救了我一命
He's a friend of T'Challa's. He saved my life.

01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:39.420
奥克耶呢
Where's Okoye?

01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:40.670
她不来了
Okoye is not coming.

01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:43.290
她和女子皇家护卫队要效忠新王
She and the dora Milaje will serve the new king.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.500
在这里等着
Wait here.

01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:56.520
我们的瓦坎达是怎么了
What has happened to our Wakanda?

01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:01.530
让心形草
Allow the heart-shaped herb

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.540
赋予你黑豹的神力
to give you the powers of the black panther,

01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:07.860
并带你进入先祖之域
and take you to the ancestral plane.

01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:45.540
不是叫你别乱翻我的东西吗
What did I tell you about going into my things?

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.120
你找到了什么
What did you find?

01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:57.390
你的家乡
Your home.

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:02.830
我给了你钥匙 就是希望你有一日能见到那里
I gave you a key hoping that you might see it someday.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.420
对
Yes.

01:27:05.490 --> 01:27:08.650
那里有世上最美的日落
The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world.

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:13.660
但恐怕你还是不会受欢迎
But I fear you still may not be welcome.

01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:16.820
为什么
Why?

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.920
他们会说你迷失了
They will say you are lost.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.680
但我就在这里
But I'm right here.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.570
不为我流泪吗
No tears for me?

01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.410
人人都会死
Everybody dies.

01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:39.200
这里的生活就是如此
It's just life around here.

01:27:43.570 --> 01:27:45.390
看看我做了什么
Well, look at what I have done.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:49.410
我早该带你回去的
I should've taken you back long ago.

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.800
结果 我们都被抛弃在了这里
Instead, we are both abandoned here.

01:27:59.750 --> 01:28:02.470
或许你的家乡才迷失了
Well, maybe your home is the one that's lost.

01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:06.400
所以他们才找不到我们
That's why they can't find us.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.220
呼吸 呼吸 国王陛下 呼吸
Breathe! Breathe, my king, breathe.

01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:18.520
呼吸 呼吸
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

01:28:35.670 --> 01:28:37.520
那是心形草的效力
The heart-shaped herb did that?

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.650
- 这是全部的了吗 - 对
- This all of it? - Yes.

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.550
这样等再有下任国王时
So when it comes time for another king,

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.850
我们会有所准备
we will be ready.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.700
下任国王
Another king?

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.620
全烧了吧
Yeah, go ahead and burn all that.

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.620
陛下 我们不能那么做
My king, we cannot do that.

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.250
这是我们的传统
It is our tradition...

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.730
我叫你做什么的话 我就不是闹着玩的
When I tell you to do something, I mean that shit.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.670
全烧了
Burn it all!

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.640
在我们那里
You know, where I'm from...

01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:59.370
黑人掀起革命时
when black folks started revolutions,

01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:01.370
从来没有足够火力
they never had the firepower,

01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:03.900
和资源去对抗压迫者
or the resources to fight their oppressors.

01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:05.710
那时候瓦坎达在哪
Where was Wakanda?

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.790
到此为止了
Yeah, all that ends today.

01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:17.020
我们在全球每个国家都有探子
We got spies embedded in every nation on earth.

01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:18.610
都已就位
Already in place.

01:30:18.850 --> 01:30:20.650
我知道殖民者怎么思考
I know how colonizers think.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:23.130
我们就用他们的策略对付他们
So we're gonna use their own strategy against 'em.

01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:26.900
我们要把振金武器送去给我们的战士
We're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our war dogs.

01:30:27.170 --> 01:30:29.830
让他们把武器分给全世界的被压迫者
They'll arm oppressed people all over the world...

01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:32.560
让他们能起义 杀死当权者
so they can finally rise up and kill those in power.

01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:33.850
还有他们的孩子
And their children.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:36.240
和其他与他们同流的人
And anyone else who takes their side.

01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:38.710
该让他们知道我们真实的样子了
It's time they know the truth about us!

01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:40.240
我们是战士
We're warriors!

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:44.090
世界要大翻盘 这次 我们要占据上风
The world's gonna start over, and this time, we're on top.

01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:48.810
瓦坎达将成为日不落帝国
The sun will never set on the Wakandan empire.

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:52.200
瓦坎达能延续至今
Wakanda has survived for so long,

01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:55.830
一直是只在绝对必要时动武
by fighting when only absolutely necessary.

01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:59.000
瓦坎达过去的确是如此行事
Wakanda survived in the past this way, yes.

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.400
但世界在改变 将军
But the world is changing, general.

01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:05.990
长老们 世界越来越小了
Elders, it is getting smaller.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.100
外面的世界在追赶上来
The outside world is catching up.

01:31:08.150 --> 01:31:10.800
很快 局面就会成为不去征服
And soon it will be the conquerors

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:12.760
便会被征服
or the conquered.

01:31:14.650 --> 01:31:16.330
我宁可做前者
I'd rather be the former.

01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:21.390
你们都听到命令了 我们开始吧
You heard your orders. Let's get to it.

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.390
我们要去哪
So where are we going again?

01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:27.040
我们要带心形草去贾巴里部落
We're taking the heart-shaped herb to Jabaril and.

01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:29.020
心形草 那是什么
Heart-shaped herb? What is that?

01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:31.560
服用者能获得增强的能力
It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities.

01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:34.210
所以特查拉才那么强壮
It's what made T'Challa so strong.

01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:35.940
娜吉雅
Nakia.

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:41.600
这样不好
I don't like this.

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.600
心形草是我们的
The herb belongs to us.

01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:47.560
给姆巴库 可能会造就更大的怪物
We may be creating a bigger monster with M'Baku.

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:57.140
娜吉雅 你该自己服下它
Nakia, you should take it yourself.

01:31:57.650 --> 01:32:01.410
我是个探子 还没有军队
I am a spy with no army.

01:32:02.410 --> 01:32:04.230
我绝无机会的
I wouldn't stand a chance.

01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:07.200
我们去吧
We'll go.

01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:15.190
天呐
Oh, boy.

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.030
该死
Oh, shit.

01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:24.850
低头 保持冷静
Look down. Stay calm.

01:32:25.190 --> 01:32:26.410
苏睿
Shuri.

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.780
低头
Look down.

01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:05.730
我儿子
My son...

01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:10.400
在仪式格斗中被杀
was murdered in ritual combat.

01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:12.640
- 机会公平吗 - 是的 但是
- Were the odds fair? - Yes, but...

01:33:12.710 --> 01:33:14.650
那就不是"被杀" 而是"被击败"
So it was less a murder than a defeat.

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.290
- 别戳我们的痛处 - 闭嘴
- Do not rub our noses in it! - Silence!

01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:20.470
在这里 我才有权说话 小丫头
I make the pronouncements here, girl.

01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:24.770
殿下 新王是个美国…
Look, uh, your highness, the new king is a U.S...

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.360
新王
The new king...

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.310
你不能说话
You cannot talk!

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.750
再多说一句
One more word,

01:33:38.770 --> 01:33:41.320
我就拿你喂我的孩子
and I will feed you to my children.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.900
我开玩笑的 我们吃素的
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

01:33:54.810 --> 01:33:57.760
大猩猩姆巴库
Great gorilla M'Baku...

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.020
我们是为此而来
This is why we are here.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.900
我们要把它献给你
To offer this to you.

01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:09.840
一个外人坐在了王位上
An outsider sits on our throne.

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.350
只有你能帮我们阻止他
Only you can help us stop him.

01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.170
跟我来
Come with me.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.460
不可能
Impossible!

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:56.020
他还有气吗
Is he breathing?

01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:59.080
他陷入了昏迷 生命垂危
He's in a coma. Barely clinging to life.

01:34:59.470 --> 01:35:01.260
我们的一个渔人发现了他
One of our fishermen found him

01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:02.980
漂到了河边
at the edge of the river border.

01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.420
他把他带来给了我
He brought him to me.

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:05.910
你怎么把他放在雪里
Why do you have him in the snow?

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:08.800
这是唯一让他不会去见祖先的东西
It is the only thing keeping him from joining the ancestors.

01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:11.290
我们得送他去我的实验室 我在那里能治好他
We need to get him to my lab. I can heal him there.

01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:13.700
带他走吧 不出几秒他就会死
Take him. He'll be dead in seconds.

01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:16.770
娜吉雅 心形草
Nakia, the herb.

01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:35.590
我呼唤祖先
I call upon the ancestors.

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.680
我呼唤芭丝特
I call upon bast.

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:41.310
我跟我儿子 特查拉在一起
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:43.680
治好他
Heal him.

01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:58.470
我们得把他埋起来 盖住他
We must bury him. Cover him. Cover him!

01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.600
好
Okay.

01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:13.370
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:14.940
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:16.370
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:17.840
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.450
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.340
醒醒 特查拉
Wake up, T'Challa.

01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:24.700
醒来吧
Wake up.

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.390
儿子
My son.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.880
你该回家来
The time has come for you to come home...

01:36:38.010 --> 01:36:40.190
跟我团聚了
And be reunited with me.

01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:52.640
为什么
Why?

01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:57.700
你为什么不带那男孩回家
Why didn't you bring the boy home?

01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:01.370
为什么 爸爸
Why, Baba?

01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:04.100
他
He...

01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:08.300
他是我选择无视的真相
He was the truth I chose to omit.

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.280
你不该抛弃他
You were wrong to abandon him.

01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:14.690
我选择了我的人民
I chose my people.

01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:17.450
我选择了瓦坎达
I chose Wakanda.

01:37:17.950 --> 01:37:19.890
我们的未来需要…
Our future depended...

01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:21.510
你错了
You were wrong!

01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:23.770
你们都错了
All of you were wrong!

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:27.720
对外面的世界袖手旁观
To turn your backs on the rest of the world!

01:37:29.770 --> 01:37:32.260
我们因为害怕被发现
We let the fear of our discovery

01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:34.700
而没有做正确的事
stop us from doing what is right!

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.100
再不能了
No more!

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:44.780
我不能留下陪你
I cannot stay here with you.

01:37:46.410 --> 01:37:50.830
我不能安心地让他坐在王位上
I cannot rest while he sits on the throne.

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:54.570
他是我们制造出来的怪物
He is a monster of our own making.

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:59.470
我必须夺回王位 必须
I must take the mantle back. I must!

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.830
我必须纠正错误
I must right these wrongs.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.600
你们有毯子吗
Do you have a blanket?

01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:22.430
杀人魔头有军队的完全支持
Killmonger has the full support of our military.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.560
而且
And

01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:27.340
他还烧掉了心形草园
he burned the garden of the heart-shaped herb.

01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:28.870
当然了
Of course he did.

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.470
那是他受的训练
That's what he was trained to do.

01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.540
他的部队以前曾跟中情局合作
His unit used to work with the CIA

01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:34.680
颠覆外国政权
to destabilize foreign countries.

01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.960
他们总在权力交接时出手
They would always strike at transitions of power...

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.240
比如大选之年 或是国王死后
Like an election year, or the death of a monarch.

01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:41.850
控制政府 军队
You get control of government, the military...

01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:43.940
- 我们的资源 - 没错
- Our resources. - Right.

01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:45.990
圣山
The great mound.

01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:48.180
我们的振金 我的科技
Our vibranium, all of my designs.

01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.750
他会把我们的武器送去全世界
He will send our weapons all over the world.

01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:56.210
你必须带她们安全离开瓦坎达
You must get them out of Wakanda safely.

01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:58.130
- 什么 - 那你呢
- What? - What about you?

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.400
挑战还要继续
The challenge will have to continue.

01:39:00.490 --> 01:39:04.030
特查拉 我们不会离开瓦坎达
T'Challa, we will not leave Wakanda.

01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:06.090
我有责任保护你们
It is my duty to keep you safe.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.840
如果他拿到了我们的科技
If he gets control of our technology,

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.800
哪里都不会安全了
nowhere will be safe.

01:39:30.850 --> 01:39:32.690
黑豹不死
The black panther lives.

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:35.770
等到他为瓦坎达的命运而战时
And when he fights for the fate of Wakanda

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:38.230
我也会伴他左右
I will be right there beside him.

01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:40.800
我也是
As will I.

01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:42.530
我也加入
I'm in, too.

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.570
怎么了 你会需要全部的帮助
What? You're gonna need all the help you can get.

01:39:49.630 --> 01:39:51.040
你们煽情够了没
Are you done?

01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:54.250
够了没
Are you done?

01:39:55.810 --> 01:39:58.890
可以让我和姆巴库大人单独谈谈吗
Could you give me and lord M'Baku a moment?

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:08.650
谢谢
Thank you.

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.360
我欠你个大人情
I owed you a great debt.

01:40:12.370 --> 01:40:14.060
一命换一命
A life for a life.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:15.810
我们两清了
Consider it paid.

01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:18.780
请允许我母亲留下
Please allow my mother to stay here.

01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:21.990
她不会有事的 我保证
No harm will come to her. I give you my word.

01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:26.070
我还挺需要支军队的
You know, I could use an army as well.

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.850
当然了
I bet you could.

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.210
但不行
But no.

01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:34.620
我不能让贾巴里人为你的使命送死
I will give no Jabari lives towards your cause.

01:40:34.670 --> 01:40:36.390
这是我们的使命
It is our cause.

01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:39.070
- 这是为了我们所有人 - 我们吗
- It is for all of us. - Oh, us'?

01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:41.820
你是几世纪来第一个屈尊到此的国王
Us? You are the first king to come here in centuries,

01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:45.970
现在还说什么"我们"
and now you speak of "Us"?

01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:49.580
我无法代表先王们
I cannot speak for past kings.

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:53.170
但此刻 有敌人坐在王座上
But an enemy sits on the throne right now.

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.110
我们都清楚振金的威力
We both know the power of vibranium.

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:59.030
如果杀人魔头拿到了它
If Killmonger gains control of it,

01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.110
你觉得他会来找谁
who do you think he will come for next?

01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:09.730
我们不会
We will not

01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:12.390
帮你的
help you.

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.090
一切就绪
Everything is on schedule.

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:43.290
探子都收到消息了吗
Have the spies been alerted?

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:46.050
是的 有些人抗拒我们的新任务
Yes. Some resistance to our new mission.

01:41:46.110 --> 01:41:47.760
但伦敦 纽约
But the war dogs in London,New York

01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:49.840
和香港的战士都就绪了
and Hong Kong are standing by.

01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:52.590
我们先攻击那里
We'll strike there first.

01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:54.430
其他人会想通的
The others will come around.

01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:55.910
看啊
Look at this.

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.230
手持声波炮
A handheld Sonic Cannon,

01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.920
足以抵挡一辆坦克
powerful enough to stop a tank...

01:41:59.070 --> 01:42:00.900
金属探测器又探测不到
Untraceable by metal detectors.

01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:02.920
而我们有数千支
And we got thousands of them.

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.940
世界会清楚地了解我们的本事
The world's gonna find out exactly who we are.

01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:40.820
他没死
He lives.

01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:46.960
尼贾达卡
N'jadaka!

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.140
你好啊
Wassup?

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:51.460
我还没认输呢
I never yielded!

01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:55.640
你看到了 我也没死
And as you can see, I am not dead!

01:42:56.210 --> 01:42:58.120
挑战已经结束了
All that challenge shit is over with!

01:42:58.230 --> 01:42:59.630
我现在是国王了
I'm the king now!

01:42:59.690 --> 01:43:02.350
让飞机升空 继续任务
Get those planes in the air! Carry out the mission!

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:12.420
- 苏睿 动手 - 收到
- Shuri, now. - Copy that.

01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:18.090
走 快走 走啊 罗斯
Go, go, go! Come on, Ross!

01:43:18.250 --> 01:43:21.030
瓦卡比 杀了这小丑
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:25.040
瓦卡比 挑战还没结束
W'Kabi, the challenge is not complete.

01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:30.660
我们怎么办
What will we do?

01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:33.160
边境部落
Border tribe!

01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:47.880
你
You!

01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:50.310
你的心里满是仇恨
Your heart is so full of hatred...

01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:52.590
你不配做国王
You are not fit to be a king!

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.170
- 来啊 - 阿由 去帮国王
- Come on! - Ayo, the king!

01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:15.650
盾
Shields!

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:52.280
瓦卡比 停下吧
W'Kabi, stop this!

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.590
马上停下
Stop this now!

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:00.150
