14:02.450 --> 14:05.820
村子里每个人都在跳舞
Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.200
除了一个女人
Except one woman.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.970
我的奥薇特
My Ovette.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.140
我立刻就知道她是我的真命天女
I knew immediately she was the one for me.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.990
即使听着最有旋律的音乐
The most melodic song in the world could be playing.

14:15.370 --> 14:17.520
她连脚都不会点一下
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.830
动都不会动一下
Wouldn't move a muscle.

14:20.810 --> 14:23.140
看上去就像是死了
One might assume she was dead.

14:23.450 --> 14:25.330
听起来很性感
That does sound pretty hot.

14:25.670 --> 14:27.890
我下面都要充血了
It would make my nether regions engorge.

14:27.890 --> 14:29.920
好吧  我懂了  没错
Okay. I get it, yes.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.510
我是个舞者  而卡魔拉不是
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

14:32.510 --> 14:36.460
你只需要找到一个跟你一样不着调的女人
You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.

14:41.670 --> 14:44.370
我饿了  那些亚罗根给我来点
I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.

14:44.370 --> 14:46.230
不行  还没熟
No. It's not ripe yet...

14:46.230 --> 14:47.110
而且我恨你
and I hate you.

14:47.110 --> 14:48.220
你恨我
You hate me?

14:48.580 --> 14:51.260
你丢下了我  自己去偷那块石头了
You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.

14:51.410 --> 14:53.850
而现在你却像个英雄一样
And yet here you stand, a hero.

14:53.870 --> 14:55.730
很快我就能摆脱这枷锁
I will be free of these shackles soon enough,

14:55.730 --> 14:57.090
然后我会杀了你
and I will kill you.

14:57.350 --> 14:58.330
我发誓
I swear.

14:58.510 --> 14:59.280
不
No.

14:59.860 --> 15:01.440
你会在山达尔的监狱里
You're gonna live out the rest of your days

15:01.440 --> 15:02.780
度过余生
in a prison on Xandar...

15:03.600 --> 15:05.290
做那个白日梦
wishing you could.

15:11.710 --> 15:12.440
奇怪
This is weird.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.550
有一队索维林飞船从后面追上来了
We've got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.

15:14.550 --> 15:15.650
他们为什么要这样
Why would they do that?

15:15.650 --> 15:17.560
可能是因为火箭偷了他们几个电池
Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.570
老兄
Dude!

15:19.160 --> 15:19.870
哦
Right.

15:19.870 --> 15:21.480
他没偷电池
He didn't steal some of those.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.670
我不知道他们为什么追我们  真奇怪啊
I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.850
你怎么想的
What were you thinking?

15:35.850 --> 15:37.790
哥们  那些电池真的很容易偷
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

15:37.790 --> 15:39.270
-这就是你的辩解  -拜托
- That's your defense? - Come on!

15:39.270 --> 15:41.820
你看到那个大祭司高高在上的样子了
You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.490
我这是在教训她
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

15:44.340 --> 15:47.020
我没想到你的动机这么无私
I didn't realize your motivation was altruism.

15:47.020 --> 15:48.090
真是遗憾啊
It's really a shame

15:48.090 --> 15:49.500
那些索维林人没领会到你的好意
the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions...

15:49.500 --> 15:51.410
-还想杀掉我们  -说的太对了
- and they're trying to kill us. - Exactly!

15:51.410 --> 15:53.260
我是在讽刺你
I was being sarcastic!

15:53.260 --> 15:53.910
不
Oh, no!

15:53.910 --> 15:57.250
你应该用讽刺的语气  这下我出丑了
You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!

15:57.250 --> 15:58.360
斗嘴先省省好不好
Can we put the bickering on hold

15:58.360 --> 16:00.940
活过这场太空大战再说
until after we survive this massive space battle?

16:00.940 --> 16:02.470
-更多敌人朝我们来了  -很好
- More incoming! - Good!

16:02.470 --> 16:04.250
我想杀杀人
I wanna kill some guys!

16:12.120 --> 16:13.430
你谁也没杀掉
You're not killing anyone.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.400
这些飞船都是遥控驾驶的
All those ships are remotely piloted.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.620
该死
Damn it!

16:29.640 --> 16:32.180
在磨蹭什么  舰队司令
What is the delay, Admiral?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.120
大祭司  那些电池
High Priestess, the batteries,

16:34.120 --> 16:36.120
它们极其易燃
they are exceptionally combustible...

16:36.120 --> 16:37.580
可能会摧毁整个舰队
and could destroy the entire fleet.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.580
我们在意的是他们对我们的不敬
Our concern is their slight against our people.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.370
我们雇佣了他们  他们却偷我们的
We hired them and they steal from us.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.680
这是最大的亵渎
It is heresy of the highest order.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.670
所有操作单位
All command modules...

16:51.290 --> 16:53.820
对目标格杀勿论
fire with the intent to kill.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.150
最近的宜居星球是哪里
What's the nearest habitable planet?

17:06.160 --> 17:07.330
是一个叫博赫特的星球
It's called Berhert.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.340
-需要几次星际跳跃  -只要一次
- How many jumps? - Only one.

17:09.340 --> 17:11.840
但进入点在47公里外
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.190
而且你得穿过那片量子小行星群
And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.710
奎尔  要想穿过那里
Quill, to make it through that

17:25.710 --> 17:27.870
你得是全宇宙最棒的飞行员
you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

17:27.870 --> 17:29.230
那我们走运了
Lucky for us,

17:29.230 --> 17:30.850
-我就...  -我就是
- I... - I am.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.370
你在干什么
What are you doing?

17:44.370 --> 17:46.570
我从十岁就开始开这玩意了
I've been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.

17:46.570 --> 17:49.520
我就是为开宇宙飞船而设计制造的
I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.

17:49.520 --> 17:52.260
你就是设计制造成了个混蛋
You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!

17:52.370 --> 17:53.680
-别闹了  -奎尔
- Stop it. - Quill.

17:53.690 --> 17:55.800
今天晚上  你躺在床上的时候
Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed

17:55.800 --> 17:57.860
你的枕套里会有黏糊糊的一坨
and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.

17:57.860 --> 17:59.290
你会想"这是什么"
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

17:59.290 --> 18:02.090
那会是我放的一坨屎
And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there!

18:02.690 --> 18:05.370
你敢把你的屎放我床上  我就剃光你
You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.

18:05.370 --> 18:07.110
才不会放我的
It won't be my turd.

18:07.110 --> 18:08.590
我会放德拉克斯的
It will be Drax's.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.140
我的屎蛋出了名的大
I have famously huge turds.

18:13.140 --> 18:15.620
我们都快要死了  现在就讨论这个吗
We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing?

18:17.790 --> 18:19.120
混蛋
Son of a...

18:19.190 --> 18:20.950
哥们  搞什么
Dude! Seriously!

18:21.620 --> 18:22.360
我来...
Let me...

18:36.760 --> 18:38.290
蠢货
Idiots!

18:38.290 --> 18:40.720
奎尔开飞船就这下场
Well, that's what you get when Quill flies.

18:42.530 --> 18:44.790
还有一架索维林飞船在追我们
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.020
我们武器坏了
Our weapons are down.

18:49.550 --> 18:51.620
还有20公里跳跃
Twenty clicks to the jump!

18:55.140 --> 18:55.950
坐稳了
Hold on.

19:06.030 --> 19:07.240
还没熟呢
It's not ripe.

19:09.710 --> 19:10.850
<b>应急宇航服  也可以穿着玩</b>

19:16.140 --> 19:18.240
加油  扎莱克  你可以的
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

19:21.720 --> 19:22.830
太棒了
Yes!

19:24.300 --> 19:26.180
还有15公里跳跃
Fifteen clicks to the jump!

19:27.180 --> 19:28.060
加油
Come on!

19:29.040 --> 19:29.990
继续
Keep going!

19:44.910 --> 19:46.120
还有10公里
Ten clicks!

19:49.650 --> 19:51.540
去死吧  破船
Die, spaceship!

19:56.240 --> 19:57.590
你弱爆了  扎莱克
You suck, Zylak.

19:57.590 --> 19:58.620
不出所料
Typical.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.740
还有五公里
Five clicks!

20:08.070 --> 20:09.710
混蛋
Son of a...

20:10.060 --> 20:11.960
他们绕过了星群
They went around the field!

20:25.690 --> 20:28.090
有人摧毁了我们所有的飞船
Someone destroyed all our ships!

20:28.910 --> 20:29.740
什么
What?

20:32.830 --> 20:33.840
是谁
Who?

20:35.610 --> 20:37.100
还有一公里
One click!

20:37.740 --> 20:39.780
-那是什么  -管他呢
- What is that? - Who cares?

20:39.780 --> 20:42.190
跳跃点就在那儿  快  快
That's the jump point! Go! Go!

20:45.260 --> 20:46.200
那是个人
It's a guy.

20:54.470 --> 20:55.340
天啊
Oh, my God.

20:55.350 --> 20:56.670
他还在外面吗
He's still out there?

21:23.690 --> 21:25.470
格鲁特  系好安全带
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

21:26.610 --> 21:30.200
准备好要强行降落了
Prepare for a really bad landing!

21:56.800 --> 22:03.430
博赫特星

22:09.690 --> 22:11.280
刚才太赞了
That was awesome!

22:13.190 --> 22:14.190
棒
Yes!

22:16.240 --> 22:17.280
你看看
Look at this!

22:18.200 --> 22:20.000
咱们飞船的另一半呢
Where is the other half of our ship?

22:20.000 --> 22:20.830
是我的船
My ship.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.840
你们任何一个都可以带我们平安穿过星群
Either one of you could have gotten us through that field...

22:23.840 --> 22:25.730
如果你们肯用上面这个
had you flown with what's between your ears

22:25.730 --> 22:27.370
而不是下面那个驾驶飞船
instead of what's between your legs!

22:28.390 --> 22:31.340
如果我下面那个长了手
If what's between my legs had a hand on it...

22:31.400 --> 22:33.340
那我绝对可以用它来降落飞船
I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.

22:33.340 --> 22:34.160
彼得
Peter,

22:34.710 --> 22:36.330
我们差点被你的傲慢害死
we almost died because of your arrogance.

22:36.330 --> 22:39.730
是因为他偷能量电池还差不多
More like because he stole the Anulax batteries!

22:39.730 --> 22:42.100
那个叫棱酿电池
They're called Harbulary batteries.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.500
不  不叫那个 
No, they're not!

22:43.500 --> 22:45.970
你知道我为什么那么做吗  星嚼
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

22:46.250 --> 22:47.670
我才不叫星嚼
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

22:47.670 --> 22:49.750
因为我乐意
I did it because I wanted to!

22:49.750 --> 22:50.350
混蛋
Dick.

22:50.350 --> 22:52.650
我们为什么要讨论这个
What are we even talking about this for?

22:52.650 --> 22:55.650
刚才有个小人炸了五十艘飞船救了我们
We just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships!

22:55.650 --> 22:56.660
有多小
How little?

22:56.720 --> 22:58.670
我也不知道  大概这么小
Well, I don't know, like this?

22:58.680 --> 23:00.680
一个一英寸的小人救了我们吗
A little one-inch man saved us?

23:00.680 --> 23:03.000
他要是近一点  肯定就会大一点吧
Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.360
那叫近大远小  你个傻浣熊
That's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.100
别叫我浣熊
Don't call me a raccoon!

23:07.340 --> 23:09.660
抱歉  是我过分了
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

23:10.660 --> 23:12.120
我是想说垃圾熊猫
I meant trash panda.

23:14.300 --> 23:15.310
那样好听点吗
Is that better?

23:15.930 --> 23:16.840
我不知道
I don't know.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.200
这个更损  这个损多了
It's worse. It's so much worse.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.650
你个混蛋
You son of a...

23:22.250 --> 23:23.950
-我受够你了  -别过来
- I've had it with you! - No! Back up!

23:23.950 --> 23:25.980
有人从跳跃点跟着你们来了
Someone followed you through the jump point.

23:27.790 --> 23:30.160
放了我  你们需要我帮忙
Set me free, you'll need my help.

23:30.180 --> 23:31.000
我又不傻  星云
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.090
如果在战斗中拒绝帮助就是犯傻
You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.

23:33.090 --> 23:34.860
我一放了你  你就会攻击我的
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

23:34.860 --> 23:35.660
我不会的
No, I won't.

23:35.660 --> 23:39.200
你这种超级大坏蛋不是应该很会说谎吗
You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.210
我赌是那个一英寸的小人
I bet it's the one-inch man.

24:13.220 --> 24:16.670
时隔这么多年  我终于找到你了
After all these years, I've found you.

24:17.860 --> 24:19.280
你到底是谁
And who the hell are you?

24:20.260 --> 24:23.260
我以为我沧桑帅气的外表就足以说明了
I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.

24:24.970 --> 24:26.550
我叫伊戈
My name is Ego...

24:28.360 --> 24:30.140
我是你爸爸  彼得
and I'm your dad, Peter.

24:34.700 --> 24:38.460
康特阿克夏星

24:46.120 --> 24:47.600
你知道俗话怎么说的
You know what they say...

24:47.600 --> 24:50.330
"跟过鸭鸭  好运就来"
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."

25:17.180 --> 25:18.320
勇度
Yondu!

25:19.700 --> 25:21.350
快下来
Come on down!

25:32.590 --> 25:36.140
兜兜转转这么多年
After going around years in circles...

25:36.140 --> 25:37.680
跟我最终娶的这女人周旋
with this woman I end up marrying.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.440
我说  "艾丽塔  我爱你
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

25:40.590 --> 25:42.030
但你真是疯了"
"But you're losing your mind!"

25:42.030 --> 25:44.030
话说回来  她一直都那样
Then again, she's always been that way.

25:44.030 --> 25:45.710
我从来都不能相信她
I could never trust her. You know?

25:46.440 --> 25:47.390
斯塔卡
Stakar.

25:51.470 --> 25:52.790
好久不见
It's been some time.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.170
看来这个场子
It seems like this establishment

25:59.170 --> 26:01.520
堕落错了方式
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

26:07.570 --> 26:08.510
-先生  -斯塔卡
- Sir! - Stakar!

26:08.510 --> 26:10.860
掠夺者有一百个派系
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

26:10.860 --> 26:14.190
你为了接待其中一个  而失去了剩下99个的
You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.

26:14.190 --> 26:15.840
求你了  先生  别走
Please, sir. Please!

26:15.840 --> 26:17.650
-别碰我  -求你
- Get away from me. - Please!

26:22.410 --> 26:24.800
你下地狱吧
You can go to hell then!

26:25.530 --> 26:27.940
我不在乎你怎么看我
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

26:27.940 --> 26:29.690
那你跟着我们干什么
So what are you following us for?

26:29.690 --> 26:31.320
因为你必须听我说
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!

26:31.320 --> 26:34.550
我什么都不用听  是你背叛了准则
I don't gotta listen to nothing! You betrayed the code!

26:34.550 --> 26:36.590
掠夺者不买卖孩子
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

26:36.590 --> 26:39.370
我告诉过你  我不知道是怎么回事
I told you before! I didn't know what was going on!

26:39.380 --> 26:40.140
你不知道
You didn't know

26:40.140 --> 26:41.120
是因为你不想知道
because you didn't want to know

26:41.120 --> 26:42.200
因为你靠这个发财
because it made you rich.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.900
我要求有一席之地  我跟你们一样佩戴焰标
I demand a seat at the table! I wear these flames, same as you.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.330
你虽然穿得像我们
You may dress like us...

26:48.390 --> 26:51.420
但你死后别想听到自由号角声  勇度
but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

26:51.890 --> 26:53.770
奥戈尔的颜色
And the Colors of Ogord...

26:53.910 --> 26:56.740
也绝不会在你的墓上闪耀
will never flash over your grave.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.620
要是你觉得
If you think...

27:00.970 --> 27:04.180
流放你  让我高兴
I take pleasure in exiling you...

27:05.880 --> 27:06.770
那你就错了
you're wrong.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.810
你伤了我们所有人的心
You broke all our hearts.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.150
可悲
Pathetic.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.890
起先  奎尔背叛了我们
First, Quill betrays us...

27:31.890 --> 27:35.130
结果勇度把他毫发无伤地放走了
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

27:35.630 --> 27:38.140
我们跟随他  是因为他
We followed him because he was the one

27:38.140 --> 27:40.890
敢做不得不做的事
who wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done.

27:41.470 --> 27:43.330
看来他变软弱了
Seems he's goin' soft.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.990
要是他软弱  你这么小声干吗
If he's so soft, why are you whispering for?

27:47.330 --> 27:49.360
你知道我说得对  克拉林
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

27:49.360 --> 27:53.620
小心点  怎么说我们船长呢
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.350
这是谁
Who the hell is that?

28:35.430 --> 28:37.360
勇度·尤冬塔
Yondu Udonta...

28:37.720 --> 28:39.870
我有个提议
I have a proposition for you.

28:40.670 --> 28:42.930
你母亲去世后
I hired Yondu to pick you up

28:42.930 --> 28:44.780
我雇了勇度去接你
when your mother passed away.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.930
但他没有把你还给我
But instead of returning you...

28:47.110 --> 28:48.420
而是把你留下了
Yondu kept you.

28:48.930 --> 28:51.150
我不知道为什么
I have no clue as to why.

28:52.740 --> 28:53.930
我告诉你为什么
Well, I'll tell you why.

28:54.350 --> 28:55.620
因为我是个瘦得皮包骨的小孩
Because I was a skinny little kid

28:55.620 --> 28:57.320
能溜进成年人进不去的地方
who could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.010
偷东西更容易
It made it easier for thievin'.

28:59.010 --> 29:02.440
从那时起  我就一直在寻找你的下落
Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.

29:02.750 --> 29:04.370
我还以为勇度是你父亲
I thought Yondu was your father.

29:04.630 --> 29:06.740
什么  我们在一起这么久
What? We've been together this whole time

29:06.740 --> 29:09.370
你以为勇度是我的血亲
and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?

29:09.750 --> 29:11.180
你俩长得一模一样
You look exactly alike.

29:11.180 --> 29:12.800
勇度是蓝的
One's blue!

29:14.460 --> 29:16.280
不  他不是我父亲
No, he's not my father!

29:16.280 --> 29:18.370
勇度绑架了我
Yondu was the guy who abducted me

29:18.370 --> 29:20.520
把我打得满地找牙  让我学会怎么打架
kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight

29:20.530 --> 29:23.150
威胁要吃了我  让我一直担惊受怕
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.

29:23.150 --> 29:24.720
-吃了你  -是啊
- Eat you? - Yeah.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.580
那个王八蛋
That son of a bitch.

29:26.940 --> 29:28.340
你怎么找到我们的
How'd you locate us now?

29:29.470 --> 29:31.960
哪怕像我住得那么偏僻
Even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known

29:31.960 --> 29:34.770
也听说过传说中的星爵
we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.

29:34.770 --> 29:36.660
我们现在就出发去那儿怎么样
What say we head out there right now?

29:36.660 --> 29:38.200
欢迎你的伙伴一起去
Your associates are welcome.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.220
包括那只三角脸猴子
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

29:40.710 --> 29:41.780
我保证
I promise you...

29:42.520 --> 29:44.640
那是一个与众不同的地方
it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.120
在那里
And there...

29:46.670 --> 29:51.040
我能给你解释你特别的身世
I can explain your very special heritage.

29:51.860 --> 29:53.590
终于能做
Finally get to be the...

29:53.590 --> 29:55.580
我一直想做的那个父亲了
father I've always wanted to be.

29:58.070 --> 29:59.020
失陪了
Excuse me.

30:00.170 --> 30:01.370
我去撒泡尿
I've gotta take a whiz.

30:07.670 --> 30:08.880
我不信
I'm not buying it.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.830
我们去散步吧
Let's go take a walk.

30:19.970 --> 30:21.510
我叫螳螂
I am Mantis.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.520
你在干什么
What are you doing?

30:27.020 --> 30:28.040
微笑
Smiling.

30:29.120 --> 30:32.130
我听说  这样做能让人们喜欢你
I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.270
你那么笑可不能
Not if you do it like that.

30:36.390 --> 30:39.320
我一个人在伊戈的星球上长大
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

30:39.400 --> 30:43.300
我不了解人际交流的微妙
I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.

30:45.810 --> 30:48.940
我能摸摸你的狗狗吗  它好可爱
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.

30:52.690 --> 30:53.460
可以
Yes.

31:03.140 --> 31:06.610
这叫恶作剧
That is called a practical joke!

31:10.030 --> 31:12.090
我很喜欢
I liked it very much!

31:12.540 --> 31:14.240
是我刚想的
I just made it up!

31:16.980 --> 31:18.460
饶了我吧
Give me a break!

31:18.600 --> 31:20.020
都过了这么久了  突然出现
After all this time, you're gonna show up,

31:20.020 --> 31:22.830
-还突然要当我爸  -是啊
- and just all of a sudden you wanna be my dad? - I hear you.

31:22.830 --> 31:25.190
另外  这可能是个陷阱  好吗
And by the way, this could be a trap. Okay?

31:25.190 --> 31:26.910
克里纯种主义者  掠夺者
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

31:26.910 --> 31:28.990
-都想杀死我们  -我知道  但是
- they all want us dead. - I know, but...

31:28.990 --> 31:29.910
但是什么
But what?

31:29.910 --> 31:32.710
你给我讲的扎渡·霍索妇的故事呢
What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

31:32.720 --> 31:33.570
谁
Who?

31:33.780 --> 31:35.260
有一艘魔法船的那个
He owned a magic boat?

31:36.940 --> 31:38.310
大卫·霍索夫
David Hasselhoff?

31:38.440 --> 31:38.940
就是他
Right.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.440
不是魔法船  是会说话的车
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.720
为什么会说话来着
Why did he talk again?

31:42.720 --> 31:46.200
为了帮他打击犯罪  并给予精神支持
To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.940
你小时候会随身带着他的照片
As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket

31:48.950 --> 31:50.970
告诉其他小孩
and you would tell all the other children

31:50.970 --> 31:53.410
说他是你父亲  但他出门了
that he was your father, but that he was out of town.

31:53.410 --> 31:56.010
拍摄《霹雳游侠》或者跟乐队在德国巡回演出
Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.

31:56.010 --> 31:57.380
那是我喝醉时告诉你的
I told you that when I was drunk.

31:57.380 --> 31:58.600
你现在提它干吗
Why are you bringing that up now?

31:58.600 --> 31:59.820
我喜欢那个故事
I love that story.

31:59.820 --> 32:01.640
我讨厌那个故事
I hate that story.

32:01.940 --> 32:03.350
太可悲了
It's so sad!

32:04.200 --> 32:06.440
我小时候总是看着其他孩子
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off

32:06.440 --> 32:08.600
跟他们的爸爸玩投接球
playing catch with their dad. And I

32:08.900 --> 32:11.690
我也想让爸爸陪我玩  那是我最大的心愿
I wanted that, more than anything in the world!

32:11.740 --> 32:13.530
我就想说这个  彼得
That's my point, Peter.

32:14.630 --> 32:17.770
如果这个人就是你的霍索夫呢
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

32:20.120 --> 32:22.870
听着  如果我们发现他是坏人
Listen, if he ends up being evil...

32:24.050 --> 32:25.130
那就杀了他
we will just kill him.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.240
你要把我丢给那只狐狸
You're leaving me with that fox?

32:35.240 --> 32:36.560
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.780
要是她行为可疑  就开枪打她
Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.710
-或者你想打就打  -好
- Or if you feel like it. - Okay.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.120
就几天而已
It'll be just a couple of days.

32:45.420 --> 32:47.740
还没等火箭修好飞船  我们就能回来了
We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.290
要是索维林人来了怎么办
What if the Sovereign come?

32:53.290 --> 32:55.610
他们不可能知道我们在这儿  走吧
There's no way for them to know we're here. Let's go.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.850
我觉得兵分两路不太好
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.240
天啊  你就像个老太婆
God, you're like an old woman.

32:59.550 --> 33:00.980
因为我睿智吗
Because I'm wise?

33:02.120 --> 33:04.060
你怎么有这么多行李
Why do you have so much luggage?

33:04.090 --> 33:06.030
我不想让格鲁特乱动我的东西
I don't want Groot playing with my things.

33:09.710 --> 33:12.950
希望老爸不像你那么混蛋  小孤儿
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.

33:14.200 --> 33:18.520
你的目的是什么  让所有人都讨厌你吗
What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you?

No one has ever asked me a personal question.

Your antennae, what are they for?

34:17.370 --> 34:18.460
触角的用途
Their purpose?

34:18.460 --> 34:20.420
对  奎尔和我打了个赌
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

34:20.420 --> 34:23.310
哥们  你不应该说出来的
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

34:23.590 --> 34:24.530
我说
I say...

34:24.530 --> 34:27.160
当你要穿过一个很低的门框时
that if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low...

34:27.370 --> 34:28.730
你的触角能感知高度
your antennae will feel this,

34:28.730 --> 34:30.350
防止你撞掉脑袋
and keep you from being decapitated.

34:30.350 --> 34:32.060
对  如果是任何
Right. And if it's anything other than

34:32.060 --> 34:36.090
防止掉脑袋之外的用途  那我赢
you specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.

34:36.090 --> 34:39.420
它们不是感知门框用的
They are not for feeling doorways.

34:40.540 --> 34:41.560
我觉得
I think...

34:41.890 --> 34:45.020
它们跟我的共情能力有关
they have something to do with my empathic abilities.

34:45.160 --> 34:46.190
那是什么
What are those?

34:46.350 --> 34:50.410
我触碰别人时  我能感觉到他们的感受
If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.

34:50.570 --> 34:52.470
-你会读心术  -不是
- You read minds? - No.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.740
心灵感应是感知想法
Telepaths know thoughts.

34:55.220 --> 34:57.390
共情是感知感情
Empaths feel feelings.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.220
情绪
Emotions.

35:02.390 --> 35:03.210
可以吗
May I?

35:04.720 --> 35:05.700
好
All right.

35:14.460 --> 35:17.030
你怀着爱
You feel love.

35:18.490 --> 35:20.320

Yeah. I guess I feel a general,

35:20.320 --> 35:22.730
-对所有人的无私的大爱  -不
- unselfish love for just about everybody. - No!

35:23.020 --> 35:25.200
是浪漫的  肉欲的爱
Romantic, sexual love.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.390
我才没
No, I don't.

35:26.390 --> 35:28.070
-爱的是她  -不
- For her! - No!

35:28.070 --> 35:29.280
不是
That is not...

35:31.150 --> 35:31.990
好吧
Okay.

35:35.190 --> 35:38.140
她把你最不可告人的秘密说出来了
She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!

35:38.140 --> 35:40.160
哥们  拜托  你有点反应过度了
Dude, come on, I think you're overreacting a little bit!

35:40.160 --> 35:42.540
你肯定尴尬死了
You must be so embarrassed!

35:44.850 --> 35:47.250
来感知一下我  试试我
Do me! Do me! Do me!

35:52.890 --> 35:56.540
我从来没感觉过如此的幽默
I have never felt such humor!

35:59.330 --> 36:01.410
真是讨厌到难以置信
So unbelievably uncool.

36:03.460 --> 36:04.250
奎尔
Quill.

36:06.670 --> 36:10.510
敢摸我  你就只能感觉到下巴骨折
Touch me, and the only thing you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

36:16.030 --> 36:20.150
我也可以稍微改变人的情绪
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

36:20.190 --> 36:21.340
比如
Yeah, like what?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.830
如果我碰到悲伤的人
If I touch someone who is sad...

36:24.160 --> 36:27.560
我可以安抚他们  让他们获得暂时的满足感
I can ease them into contentment for a short while.

36:27.800 --> 36:31.250
我可以让固执的人变顺从
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

36:31.840 --> 36:34.630
但我主要用我的能力帮助主人入睡
But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.

36:34.960 --> 36:39.370
他夜里想着后代  无法入睡
He lies awake at night thinking about his progeny.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.420
在我身上试试那个
Do one of those on me.

36:46.830 --> 36:47.990
睡吧
Sleep.

还不错
Not so bad.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.820
我们接了一份美差
We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.

40:16.870 --> 40:20.450
有个自命不凡的金闪闪的姑娘
This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself has

40:20.450 --> 40:22.190
给我们开出很高的价码
offered us a large sum

40:22.190 --> 40:23.870
要我们抓到你和你的同伴交给她
to deliver you and your pals over to her

40:23.870 --> 40:25.690
因为她想杀了你们
because she wants to kill y'all.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.580
敌人太多了
There's too many of them.

他需要我帮忙  要是你在乎他
He needs my help. If you care about him...

40:33.380 --> 40:36.280
你得帮我解开手铐
you need to get me out of these bonds.

40:36.540 --> 40:38.260
他们会杀了他的
They are going to kill him!

40:38.550 --> 40:40.820
告诉你  找到你可容易了
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.

40:40.830 --> 40:42.720
山达尔大战的时候  我在你们飞船上
I put a tracer on your ship back there

40:42.720 --> 40:44.430
放了个追踪器

40:44.810 --> 40:46.830
你保证不伤害格鲁特
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot...

40:46.830 --> 40:49.310

你真走运  我说话不算数
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

40:53.140 --> 40:55.570
不然我就把你们交出去了
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.490
不然你就什么
Otherwise, you'd what?

40:58.020 --> 40:59.630
我们把电池拿走
We'll take them batteries.

40:59.630 --> 41:03.050
它们值多少  在市场上能卖个25万
They're worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?

41:03.170 --> 41:05.630
那个祭司答应给我们一百万
That Priestess offered us a million.

41:05.850 --> 41:08.630
25万才三分之一
A quarter is only one third of that!

41:08.680 --> 41:09.880
25万不是三分之一
A quarter ain't a third.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.090
25万就是25
A quarter is 25.

41:12.090 --> 41:12.740
不是
No.

41:12.740 --> 41:15.460
25连双靴子都卖不来
We can't even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.

41:15.460 --> 41:16.430
够了
Enough!

41:16.550 --> 41:19.390
重点是  我们没那么蠢
The point is, we ain't stupid enough

41:19.390 --> 41:21.840
会帮忙把银河护卫队杀掉
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

41:21.840 --> 41:24.380
整个新星军团都不会放过我们的
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.

41:24.710 --> 41:25.990
这样不对
That ain't right!

41:27.160 --> 41:29.640
我就说这一次  船长
I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.

41:36.900 --> 41:38.850
我才是会支持你的人
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

41:38.850 --> 41:39.690
别激动  克拉林
Take it easy, Kraglin.

41:39.690 --> 41:42.600
说对了  伙计  他是心变软了
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

45:00.830 --> 45:02.710
经历了数百万年

45:32.880 --> 45:35.690
我之外的生命
"Besides just me," I thought.

45:35.880 --> 45:39.470
于是  我立志要找到生命
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.580

46:04.700 --> 46:05.550

我想真正地体验为人
I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human

46:34.500 --> 46:36.940
于是我探索群星
as I set out amongst the stars...

46:38.160 --> 46:39.830
直到我找到了

46:40.240 --> 46:41.460

"You know what would be a really kick-ass name? Taserface!"

50:52.760 --> 50:54.980
我想象你就是这样
That's how I hear you in my head!

死也比做一辈子的
dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life

51:09.980 --> 51:13.950
混蛋白痴  觉得电击脸很酷强
as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.

51:13.950 --> 51:16.660
今天就杀到这儿吧

你觉得克里人会处死船长吗
You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?

52:00.460 --> 52:04.170
克里人自视仁慈  不会让他痛苦的
The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.

52:05.010 --> 52:08.460
就在这儿  这是我们最好的一艘船
Well, here it is. It's the best ship we got.

52:08.700 --> 52:10.460
伊戈星球的位置发到导航里了
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

52:10.460 --> 52:12.700
等我们拿到钱就把那10%汇给你
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

52:13.160 --> 52:14.780
你打算拿你的那份做什么
What are you gonna do with your share?

52:16.020 --> 52:17.210
我还是孩子时  我父亲会让
As a child, my father would have

52:17.210 --> 52:19.770
我和卡魔拉在训练中对打
Gamora and me battle one another in training.

52:20.960 --> 52:23.050
每次我姐姐赢了
Every time my sister prevailed

52:23.450 --> 52:26.160
我父亲就会把我身体的一部分换成机械
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery

52:26.850 --> 52:29.470
他说是希望我能像她一样强
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

52:30.840 --> 52:31.930
但她总赢
But she won...

52:32.700 --> 52:37.790
一次又一次  从没一次手下留情
again and again, and again, never once refraining.

52:39.050 --> 52:40.880
所以等我杀了我姐姐
So after I murder my sister...

52:41.740 --> 52:45.080
我要买一艘战舰  装上所有杀戮武器
I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death.

52:45.080 --> 52:46.510
我要像抓狗一样找到我父亲
I will hunt my father like a dog,

52:46.510 --> 52:48.680
然后慢慢把他撕碎
and I will tear him apart slowly

52:48.870 --> 52:50.390
一块一块地拆开
piece by piece...

52:50.390 --> 52:54.010
直到他能稍有体会我每一天所经历的
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain

52:54.010 --> 52:57.100
无休止的深刻痛苦
I know every single day.

52:58.960 --> 53:00.050
哦
Yeah.

53:00.780 --> 53:02.900
我想的是买条漂亮项链什么的
I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.

53:03.540 --> 53:05.220
或是好看的帽子
Or a nice hat. You know,

53:05.270 --> 53:08.650
让其他姑娘都说  "哎呀  真漂亮"
something to make the other girls go, "Ooh, that's nice!"

53:12.040 --> 53:15.060
总之  一路顺风
Anyways, happy trails.

53:23.150 --> 53:26.240
我母亲跟所有人说我父亲来自星星
My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.

53:28.440 --> 53:30.970
她有脑瘤  所以大家都以为她是在妄想
She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.

53:30.970 --> 53:31.810
彼得
Peter...

53:31.930 --> 53:34.400
听着  我真的很想相信这一切
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this, I really would.

53:34.400 --> 53:38.380
但你离开了这世上最棒的女人
But you left the most wonderful woman ever

53:38.850 --> 53:40.190
让她孤独离世
to die alone.

53:40.190 --> 53:43.720
我并不想离开你母亲的  彼得
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

53:43.790 --> 53:46.350
如果我不定期回到我的星球
If I don't return regularly to my planet

53:46.350 --> 53:47.760
回归其内部的光
and the light within it

53:47.810 --> 53:49.370
这个人形将退化消逝
this form will wither and perish.

53:49.370 --> 53:51.720
那你为什么不回来  你为什么叫勇度去
So why didn't you come back? Why did you send Yondu?

53:51.720 --> 53:53.980
偏偏叫一个罪犯去接我
A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?

53:53.980 --> 53:56.110
我是那么爱你母亲  彼得
I loved your mother, Peter!

53:56.110 --> 54:00.120
我无法忍受去一个再没有她的地球
I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth where she wasn't living!

54:00.120 --> 54:01.410
你无法想象那是什么感觉
You can't imagine what that's like!

54:01.410 --> 54:03.670
我非常清楚那是什么感觉
I know exactly what that feels like!

54:04.220 --> 54:06.010
我不得不看着她死去
I had to watch her die!

54:10.480 --> 54:14.820
我存在了千百万年
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence

54:14.820 --> 54:17.000
犯下了很多错误  彼得
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

54:18.020 --> 54:19.800
但你不是其中之一
But you're not one of them.

54:21.900 --> 54:23.310
请给我个机会
Please give me the chance

54:23.310 --> 54:25.590
做她会希望我做的那种父亲
to be the father she would want me to be.

54:30.470 --> 54:35.460
关于这个星球  和其内部的光
There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet

54:36.190 --> 54:37.520
我有好多要告诉你
and the light within.

54:38.010 --> 54:40.460
那是你的一部分  彼得
They are a part of you, Peter.

54:42.130 --> 54:42.970
什么意思
What do you mean?

54:44.570 --> 54:45.920
给我你的手  儿子
Give me your hands, son.

54:47.470 --> 54:48.220
来
Here.

54:49.550 --> 54:50.920
这样端住
Hold them like that.

54:54.240 --> 54:54.980
好了
Now,

54:57.220 --> 54:59.780
闭上眼睛  集中精神
close your eyes and concentrate.

55:01.480 --> 55:03.690
让思绪进入星球的中心
Take your brain to the center of this planet.

55:09.020 --> 55:10.100
太好了
Yes!

55:10.470 --> 55:11.370
就这样
Yes!

55:11.870 --> 55:13.050
太好了
Yes! Yes!

55:13.270 --> 55:14.570
-太棒了  没事  -怎么回...
- Yes! It's okay. - What was...

55:14.570 --> 55:16.170
放松  集中精神
Just relax. Concentrate.

55:16.170 --> 55:17.890
你可以的  再来
You can do it. Bring it back.

55:18.730 --> 55:19.630
很好
Yes!

55:21.050 --> 55:24.140
很好  好了  塑形
Yes, yes, now shape it.

55:24.520 --> 55:25.800
感受那股能量
Feel that energy.

55:30.520 --> 55:31.550
就这样
Yes.

55:35.800 --> 55:36.730
你回家了
You're home.

55:39.760 --> 55:40.560
彼得
Peter...

56:15.270 --> 56:18.180
你是怎么来到这颗奇怪  愚蠢的星球上的
How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?

56:18.990 --> 56:21.230
我还是个幼虫时被伊戈发现
Ego found me in my larva state.

56:21.500 --> 56:23.520
我在母星是个孤儿
Orphaned on my homeworld.

56:24.570 --> 56:27.810
他亲手养大了我  把我留在了身边
He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.

56:28.610 --> 56:30.090
那么你是个宠物
So you're a pet?

56:31.140 --> 56:32.450
大概是吧
I suppose.

56:33.980 --> 56:35.940
人们一般都养可爱的宠物
People usually want cute pets.

56:36.470 --> 56:38.540
伊戈怎么会养个这么面目可憎的
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

56:39.010 --> 56:40.290
我面目可憎吗
I am hideous?

56:40.290 --> 56:43.020
你简直丑得惊心动魄
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

56:45.700 --> 56:47.140
但那是好事
But that's a good thing.

56:48.380 --> 56:50.000
如果你长得丑  还有人爱你
When you're ugly, and someone loves you

56:50.000 --> 56:51.940
你知道那人是爱你这个人
you know they love you for who you are.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.400
美丽的人永远不知道谁能信任
Beautiful people never know who to trust.

56:56.400 --> 56:59.700
那我庆幸我很丑
Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.

57:01.670 --> 57:04.890
那些池塘  让我想起了有次
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

57:04.890 --> 57:08.340
我带女儿去我母星的遗忘湖
when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

57:09.830 --> 57:11.200
她跟你很像
She was like you.

57:11.500 --> 57:12.710
难看吗
Disgusting?

57:14.020 --> 57:15.010
天真无邪
Innocent.

57:48.760 --> 57:49.860
德拉克斯
Drax?

57:50.740 --> 57:52.610
我得告诉你件事
There's something I must tell you.

58:01.360 --> 58:02.100
怎么回事
What's going on?

58:02.110 --> 58:04.420
这位恶心的虫子女士成了我的新朋友
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

58:04.420 --> 58:07.560
我学到了很多事  比如我是个宠物  而且很丑
I'm learning many things, like I'm a pet and ugly.

58:08.400 --> 58:10.200
你不丑  德拉克斯
You're not ugly. Drax!

58:10.200 --> 58:11.360
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

58:11.360 --> 58:12.370
螳螂
Mantis...

58:12.610 --> 58:14.630
你能带我们去我们的住处吗
can you show us where we'll be staying?

58:15.820 --> 58:17.650
这颗星球上怎么没有其他生物
Why are there no other beings on this planet?

58:17.650 --> 58:19.770
这星球就是伊戈
The planet is Ego.

58:19.970 --> 58:22.900
狗不会邀请跳蚤来他背上住
A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.

58:23.020 --> 58:24.370
你不是跳蚤
And you're not a flea?

58:24.560 --> 58:26.320
我是有用的跳蚤
I'm a flea with a purpose.

58:27.360 --> 58:28.820
我帮他入眠
I help him sleep.

58:30.050 --> 58:33.150
我走出来之前  你正要跟德拉克斯说什么
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?

58:38.450 --> 58:39.430
没什么
Nothing.

58:40.270 --> 58:42.040
你们的住处在这边
Your quarters are this way.

58:49.900 --> 58:52.420
我们明早把你们送去给克里人
We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.

58:55.590 --> 58:58.560
之后你俩都活不长了
Neither one of you will last much longer after that.

58:59.510 --> 59:01.180
好啊  电击脸
Okay, Taserface.

59:02.470 --> 59:06.020
替我们跟其他人问好  电击脸
Tell the other guys we said "Hi," Taserface!

59:11.350 --> 59:13.710
这颗小植物呢  要我用石头砸碎它吗
What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?

59:13.710 --> 59:15.200
不行  杰夫
No, Gef.

59:15.200 --> 59:16.910
这么可爱怎么能杀掉
It's too adorable to kill.

59:17.290 --> 59:18.680
送去裁缝那里
Take it to the tailor.

59:20.560 --> 59:23.640
别介意  但你的雇员都是混蛋
No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.

59:26.400 --> 59:31.310
我做了20年的克里人战奴  是斯塔卡解救了我
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me.

59:33.180 --> 59:35.790
他邀我加入了掠夺者
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

59:36.500 --> 59:40.020
他说我只需要遵守准则
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.

59:41.190 --> 59:42.620
但我年轻
But I was young...

59:43.970 --> 59:47.240
贪心  愚蠢
and greedy, and stupid.

59:48.230 --> 59:50.390
就像你  偷了那些电池
Like you stealing those batteries.

59:50.390 --> 59:52.060
那更多是德拉克斯干的
That was mostly Drax.

59:53.670 --> 59:56.530
我和斯塔卡  还有其他船长
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

59:58.070 --> 01:00:00.480
我们跟你和你的朋友很像
we weren't so different from you and your friends.

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.400
那是我唯一的家庭
The only family I ever had.

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:06.130
我违反准则后
When I broke the code...

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.990
他们流放了我
they exiled me.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.180
我活该如此
This is what I deserve.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.190
等等  矫情女王
Slow down, drama queen.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:16.750
你或许是活该  但我不是
You might deserve this, but I don't.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:18.150
我们得逃出去
We gotta get outta here.

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:21.290
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:23.800
他跟他老爸走了
He went off with his old man.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:26.380
-伊戈  -对
- Ego? - Yeah.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.550
今天净是些蠢蛋名字
It's a day for dumbass names.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:34.330
你笑了  就那么一刻  我有种温暖的感觉
You're smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:37.060
但你那一口烂牙毁了这感觉
But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.590
你是职业混蛋吗
You like a professional asshole or what?

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:40.650
挺专业的反正
Pretty much a pro.

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:43.440
你为什么没像说好的那样把奎尔送去给伊戈
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.450
他很瘦小
He was skinny.

01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:50.060
能钻进我们钻不进的地方  适合偷盗
Could fit into places we couldn't. Good for thievin'.

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:57.970
我知道我们怎么出去了
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:01.520
但我需要你的小朋友
But we're gonna need your little friend.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.620
吉祥物  吉祥物
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.120
小家伙好激动  该喝一杯
Little fellow's all worked up! He needs a drink!

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:27.850
看他气成那样多可爱
Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:30.200
他太有趣了
He's goddang precious!

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:44.960
小树枝
Hey, twig!

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:46.750
过来
Come here.

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:48.640
过来
Come on.

01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:58.150
天呐  他们把你怎么了
Man... what did they do to you?

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.250
你想帮我们出去吗
You wanna help us get outta here?

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:07.540
我需要你去找样东西  然后拿来给我
There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.120
在船长室  有个原型机机械鳍
In the captain's quarters, there's a prototype fin...

01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:14.160
就是我脑袋上戴的那玩意
the thing I wore on my head.

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:18.650
床铺旁边有个抽屉  就在里面  红色的
There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's in that. It's red.

01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:19.650
懂了吗
You got it?

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:55.370
那是我的内裤
That's my underwears.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:56.140
嗯  我就觉得
Yeah, I was pretty sure

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.580
他根本就没听懂你说什么
he didn't know what you were talkin' about.

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.600
你得解释得更细致点
You have to explain it more careful.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.690
是个原型机机械鳍
It's a prototype fin.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.960
那是只奥罗尼  机械鳍  格鲁特
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.710
这次你来解释
You explain it this time.

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:16.620
好吧
All right.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.180
那是沃克的眼睛
That's Vorker's eye.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.220
他睡觉时会拿下来
He takes it out when he sleeps.

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:23.520
去  再找
Go. Look again.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.000
把眼睛留下
But leave the eye here.

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:26.720
干吗
Why?

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.500
等他明早醒来
He's gonna wake up tomorrow

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:30.510
会不知道
and he's not gonna know

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.820
他的眼睛去哪了
where his eye is!

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.800
那是张桌子
That's a desk.

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:43.220
我们说了那玩意才这么大
We told you it was this big.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.000
拜托告诉我你们船上有个冰箱
Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.160
里面全是切下来的人脚趾
with a bunch of severed human toes.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.020
好吧  那我们说好永远不再提这事了
Okay. Then let's just agree to never discuss this.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.770
你要打开的抽屉  上面有这个标志
The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.750
好吗
Okay?

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.100
什么  不
What? No!

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.780
他以为你要他把那个当帽子戴
He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:20.370
我不是那么说的
That's not what I said!

you realize part of that head is the hat.

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:10.370
-你知道  -《布兰迪》
- You know... - Brandy?

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:12.040
镜子组合的
By Looking Glass?

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.120
是你妈妈的最爱
A favorite of your mom's.

01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:17.230
是啊
Yeah, it was.

01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:19.660
是地球最伟大的音乐作品之一
One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.700
也许就是最伟大的
Perhaps its very greatest.

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:22.770
说得太对了
Yeah, yes!

01:19:22.770 --> 01:19:26.700
彼得  你我就是那首歌里的水手
Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.

01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:30.230
他在一个夏日出现
He came on a summer's day.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:33.230
带来远方的礼物
Bringing gifts from far away.

01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:37.300
就像我让你妈妈怀上的那个孩子
Like the child I put in your mother...

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.840
或是你给卡魔拉的自由
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.980
布兰迪  你是个好姑娘
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:47.510
你肯定会是个好妻子
What a good wife you would be.

01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:51.520
我的生活  我的爱
My life, my love.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.460
我的女人是大海
My lady is the sea.

01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:57.130
大海召唤着水手
The sea calls the sailor back.

01:19:57.130 --> 01:20:00.090
他爱那姑娘  但那里不是他的天地
He loves the girl, but that's not his place.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.960
大海召唤他  就像历史召唤伟人
The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men.

01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:09.350
有时我们无法享受凡人的乐趣
And sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.

01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:11.950
你可能不是凡人  但我
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:13.050
不  彼得
No, Peter...

01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:15.670
只要这颗星球内的光不熄
death will remain a stranger to both of us

01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:18.050
我们就都不用面对死亡
as long as the light burns within the planet.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.880
我可以永生不死
I'm immortal?

01:20:22.330 --> 01:20:23.160
真的吗
Really?

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.260
对  只要光还在
Yes! As long as the light exists.

01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:30.940
我可以用那光建造很酷的东西  就像
And I can use the light to build cool things like

01:20:31.210 --> 01:20:32.780
你当初建造这颗星球那样
how you made this whole planet?

01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:35.350
你可能要花几百万年时间去练习
It might take you a few million years of practice

01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:37.700
才能得心应手  但  没错
before you get really good at it. But, yes!

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:39.430
什么  这太
What! This is...

01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:42.300
准备见识一个八百英尺的吃豆人雕像吧
Well, get ready for an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.130
旁边还有骷髅王[动画形象]和希瑟·拉克里尔[女星]
with Skeletor and Heather Locklear.

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:44.830
你想干什么都行
You can do anything you want.

01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:46.980
我要做一些奇怪的东西
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:50.230
但是  彼得  这是巨大的责任
But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility.

01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:52.950
只有我们能重塑宇宙
Only we can remake the universe.

01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:55.920
只有我们能牵着宇宙的缰绳
Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.060
领导它走向正确的方向
and lead it to where it needs to go.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:00.520
怎么做
How?

01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:12.130
跟我来
Come with me.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.450
德拉克斯  德拉克斯
Drax, Drax. Drax!

01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:26.300
德拉克斯  我们得谈谈
Drax! We need to talk.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.550
抱歉
I'm sorry.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.590
但我喜欢稍微有点肉的女人
But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:33.640
什么
What?

01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:35.180
我说我觉得你恶心
I tried to let you down easily

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:37.230
就是不想让你太伤心
by telling you I found you disgusting.

01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:38.840
不  我不是想...
No, that's not what I...

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.400
你在干什么
What are you doing?

01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:46.650
我在想象跟你有肌肤之亲
I'm imagining being with you physically.

01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:48.290
德拉克斯  我不是想
Drax... That's not...

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.860
我对你不是那种喜欢
I don't like you like that.

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.470
我都不喜欢你这个物种
I don't even like the type of thing you are.

01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:54.650
没必要人身攻击
There's no need to get personal.

01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:57.800
听着  伊戈得到了他想要的
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.220
我应该早点告诉你的
I should have told you earlier.

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.600
我真傻
I'm stupid.

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:02.720
你们有危险了
You are in danger.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:09.960
那是什么
What is that?

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:16.910
你得重新调整你看待生命的方式
Now, you need to readjust the way you process life.

01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:19.940
我们身边的一切  包括那个姑娘
Everything around us, including the girl...

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:23.410
一切都是暂时的
Everything is temporary.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:26.240
我们才是永恒
We are forever.

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:28.040
永恒不会无聊吗
Doesn't eternity get boring?

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.170
如果你有目标就不会  彼得
Not if you have a purpose, Peter,

01:22:30.170 --> 01:22:32.530
你来这儿就是为了那个目标
which is why you're here.

01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:35.240
我告诉过你  很多年前
I told you how all those years ago

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:39.260
我有一股不灭的冲动  想找到生命
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.750
但我没告诉你的是
But what I did not tell you was how,

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:43.550
当我终于找到它的时候
when I finally did find it...

01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:45.750
它是那么的
it was all so...

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.260
令人失望
disappointing.

01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:53.030
那时我才
And that is when I came...

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:57.860
深深地顿悟了
to a profound realization.

01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:03.230
我内心寻找其他生命的渴望
My innate desire to seek out other life

01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:07.960
不是为了让我能游走于那生命之间
was not so that I could walk among that life.

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.020
彼得
Peter...

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:15.340
我找到了意义
I have found meaning.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.470
我看见了
I see it.

01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:40.630
永恒
Eternity!

01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:42.640
天啊
Oh, my God.

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.230
我们得离开这颗星球
We need to get off this planet.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.060
天啊
Oh, man.

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:13.010
总之  我被粗鲁地打断之前我正在说...
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted...

01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:16.220
那时  我是个联邦快递的快递员
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:29.240
你干什么呢  小子
What the hell you doing, boy?

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:31.080
从你说到他时的样子我看得出
I could tell by how you talked about him

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.790
这个伊戈不是好人
this Ego is bad news.

01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:34.650
我们得来救奎尔
We're here to save Quill.

01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:36.060
为了什么
For what?

01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:38.070
荣誉吗
For honor?

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.040
爱吗
For love?

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.570
不  我才不在乎那些
No. I don't care about those things.

01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:44.500
我想救奎尔  好证明我比他强
I wanna save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him!

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:47.650
我能拿这事压他一辈子
I can lord this over him forever.

01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:50.850
你笑我做什么
What are you laughing at me for?

01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:56.030
你可以骗自己和其他所有人  但你骗不了我
You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.

01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:57.820
我了解你
I know who you are.

01:24:57.830 --> 01:25:00.260
你才不了解我呢  废物
You don't know anything about me, loser.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.600
我了解你的一切
I know everything about you.

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:05.580
我知道你假装是最坏最狠的人
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest,

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:07.440
但你其实最害怕
but, actually, you're the most scared of all.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:07.940
闭嘴
Shut up!

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.640
我知道你偷你用不着的电池
I know you steal batteries you don't need

01:25:10.650 --> 01:25:13.050
你推开每一个愿意忍受你的人
and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you

01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:14.810
因为哪怕一点点爱
because just a little bit of love

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:18.530
也会提醒你  你内心的空虚多大多深
reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:19.470
我叫你闭嘴了
I said shut up!

01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:21.450
我知道那些制造了你的科学家
I know them scientists what made you,

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:23.460
根本没在乎过你
never gave a rat's ass about you.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.320
我说真的  哥们
I'm serious, dude!

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.780
就像我自己的父母  他们把我
Just like my own damn parents who sold me

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.230
他们的亲生儿子  卖去做奴隶
their own little baby, into slavery.

01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:32.760
我知道你是什么人  小子
I know who you are, boy.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.660
因为你是我
Because you're me.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.330
我们是一对儿什么样的人啊
What kind of a pair are we?

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:47.670
大概是一对儿要去对付一颗星球的人吧
The kind that's about to go fight a planet, I reckon.

01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:50.270
好啊  好嘞  很好
All right, okay! Good.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.340
等等
Wait.

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:52.580
对付什么
Fight a what?

01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:58.180
你们是什么人
Who are you people?

01:25:58.180 --> 01:25:58.930
这地方是什么
What is this place?

01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:00.500
卡魔拉  放了她
Gamora, let her go!

01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:03.060
洞里的尸体  他们是谁
The bodies in the caverns... Who are they?

01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:05.140
你在害怕
You are scared.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.540
我称之为扩张
I call it the Expansion.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.280
这是我的目标
It is my purpose

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.400
现在
and now

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:19.590
它也是你的目标了
it is yours as well.

01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:21.960
好美啊
It's beautiful.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.360
数千年来
Over thousands of years,

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.000
我将数千个我的延伸根植在了
I implanted thousands of extensions of myself

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.530
数千个世界上
on thousands of worlds.

01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:35.780
我得实现生命唯一真正的目标
I need to fulfill life's one true purpose...

01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:37.940
生长  传播
To grow and spread

01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:41.160
覆盖一切存在
covering all that exists

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:45.430
直到一切都
until everything is...

01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:47.580
变成我
Me!

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:49.840
她对我做了什么
What did she do to me?

01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:52.410
她已经把一切都告诉我了
She already told me everything.

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.970
我只有一个问题
I only had one problem.

01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:57.440
一个天神
A single Celestial

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.270
是没有足够能量完成这样的伟业的
doesn't have enough power for such an enterprise.

01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:03.250
但两个天神
But two Celestials...

01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:06.640
那或许就可以了
Well, now, that just might do.

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:10.650
那些尸体
The bodies...

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:12.970
都是他的孩子
are his children.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.130
我所做的一切中
Out of all my labors

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.250
我最喜欢的
the most beguiling

01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:21.550
就是尝试将我的DNA嫁接到其他物种上
was attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species.

01:27:21.650 --> 01:27:24.130
我原本希望这样的配对
I hoped the result of such a coupling

01:27:24.130 --> 01:27:26.710
足以为扩张提供能量
would be enough to power the Expansion.

01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:30.410
我让勇度把一些后代送来给我
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.

01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:32.040
这有违掠夺者的准则
It broke the Ravager code,

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.300
但我慷慨地赔偿了他
but I compensated him generously and

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.830
而且为安抚他的良心  我说我绝不会伤害他们
to ease his conscience, I said I'd never hurt them.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.510
这倒不假  他们都毫无感觉
I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing.

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:43.460
但他们一个个都让我失望了
But one after the other, they failed me.

01:27:44.110 --> 01:27:47.260
没有一个携带了天神基因
Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.

01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:49.290
直到你  彼得
Until you, Peter.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.640
我所有的后裔里
Out of all my spawn,

01:27:53.230 --> 01:27:57.410
只有你继承了与光的联系
only you carried the connection to the light.

01:27:57.610 --> 01:28:00.500
我们得马上找到彼得  离开这个破星球
We need to find Peter now, and get off this damn planet.

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.180
伊戈现在肯定已经拉拢了他
Ego will have won him to his side by now.

01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.880
-他有办法...  -那我们直接走吧
- He has a way of... - Then we just go.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.860
不行
No!

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.980
他是我们的朋友
He's our friend.

01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:09.420
你们就成天冲彼此大吼
All any of you do is yell at each other.

01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:10.600
你们才不是朋友
You are not friends.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.670
你是对的
You're right.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.920
我们是家人
We're family.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.010
我们不丢下任何人
We leave no one behind.

01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.740
或许除了你
Except maybe you.

01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:23.920
天呐
Oh, my God.

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.400
我存在以来首次
For the first time in my existence,

01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:29.760
真正不再孤单了
I am truly not alone!

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.550
怎么了  儿子
What is it, son?

01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:41.130
我的朋友们
My friends.

01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:46.480
你瞧  这就是你人性的一面  彼得
You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.

01:28:47.250 --> 01:28:47.970
是啊
Yes.

01:28:47.970 --> 01:28:50.860
我们超越了那些东西
We are beyond such things.

01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:51.890
是啊
Yes.

01:28:54.610 --> 01:28:56.140
-好了  -但我母亲
- Now... - But my mother...

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.920
你说你爱我母亲的
You said you loved my mother.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.670
我是爱她
And that I did.

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.540
我的水百合
My river lily who knew

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:08.940
她会唱收音机里播放的每一首歌
all the words to every song that came over the radio.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:13.370
我三次回到地球看她
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:15.750
我知道  如果我再第四次回去
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:17.550
我就再不会走了
I'd never leave.

01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:20.060
扩张
The Expansion...

01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:24.280
我存在的目的  就完了
the reason for my very existence, would be over.

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.850
所以我做了我必须做的
So, I did what I had to do.

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:27.760
但是
But

01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:32.420
让她患上脑瘤简直伤透了我的心
it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.

01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:38.060
什么
What?

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:39.130
好吧
Now, all right...

01:29:39.130 --> 01:29:42.180
我知道这听上去很不好
I know that sounds bad.

01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:53.080
你
Who

01:29:53.710 --> 01:29:57.170

01:29:57.170 --> 01:29:59.090
你杀了我母亲
You killed my mother!

01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:00.380

I tried...

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.060

so hard...

01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:06.010
找到最适合你的形态
to find the form that best suited you...

01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:09.200
这就是你的感谢吗
and this is the thanks I get?

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:12.660
你真得长大了
You really need to grow up.

01:30:16.890 --> 01:30:18.870
我本想跟你一起做的
I wanted to do this together...

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:21.070
但看来你只能
but I suppose you'll have to learn

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.500
做个一千年的电池  慢慢长进了
by spending the next thousand years as a battery!

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.490
可算  火箭
Finally! Rocket?

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:31.190
把发射器带在身边  我好找你
Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.

01:30:31.190 --> 01:30:33.250
我们在一件旧施工设备里
We're in an old piece of construction equipment

01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:36.380
勇度曾用它来切开艾斯克维拉银行
Yondu once used to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.370
伊戈是个疯子
Ego's unhinged.

01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:38.790
我知道  准备好
I know. Get ready.

01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:40.200
放  克拉林
Drop her, Kraglin.

01:30:58.650 --> 01:30:59.890
不
No.

01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:14.130

My life, my love.

My lady is the sea

01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:19.420

Peter...

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:22.710
这就是那海
this is the sea.

01:32:05.730 --> 01:32:07.620
你好啊  混蛋
Hey, there, jackass!

01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:19.240
那是什么玩意
What is that thing?

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.050
闪开  小笨格鲁特
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:35.990
我就说有点不对劲
I told you something didn't feel right.

01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:38.650
"我早说过"  我现在正需要听这种话
"I told you so." Just what I need to hear right now.

01:32:38.650 --> 01:32:40.230
我不是回来了吗
Well, I came back, didn't I?

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.420
因为我们有心照不宣的情愫
Because there's an unspoken thing.

01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:44.640
才没有什么心照不宣的情愫
There is no unspoken thing.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.060
你干什么呢  你差点害死我们
What are you doing? You could've killed us all!

01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:48.850
"谢谢  火箭"
"Thank you, Rocket"?

01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:50.230
我们都控制局面了
We had it under control.

01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:53.920
我们没有  那只是他真身的延伸
We did not. That is only an extension of his true self.

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.200
他很快就会回来的
He will be back soon.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.270
蓝妹妹怎么在这儿
What's Smurfette doing here?

01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:58.360
我只想搭车回家
Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:00.000
她还想杀我
She tried to murder me!

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
我救了你  你个蠢狐狸
I saved you, you stupid fox!

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.470
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:05.550
-我是格鲁特  -我也不是浣兔
- I am Groot. - I'm not a raboon, either.

01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:06.830
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:08.600
是"浣熊"  算了
"Raccoon." Whatever.

01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:13.380
怎么杀一个天神啊
How do we kill a Celestial?

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:14.790
他有个核
There's a center to him.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.170
他的大脑还是灵魂什么的
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:18.860
有个保护壳
Some sort of protective shell.

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:21.440
在地表下的洞穴里
It's in the caverns below the surface.

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:24.710
勇度
Yondu?

01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:35.380
推进器失去动力了
Thrusters are out.

01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.280
看来我该庆幸我长得瘦
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.

01:33:37.290 --> 01:33:39.540
否则你就会把我交给这个疯子了
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.

01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:42.080
你还以为那是我留下了你的原因吗  白痴
You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.140
是你这么跟我说的  你个老笨蛋
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:46.400
我搞明白了其他孩子的下场后
Once I figured out what happened to them other kids

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.120
我当然不能把你交出去
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.080
你说你要吃了我
You said you were gonna eat me.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.850
那是玩笑话
That was being funny!

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.450
我可没想笑
Not to me!

01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:55.030
你们真有毛病
You people have issues.

01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:57.150
我当然有毛病
Of course I have issues.

01:33:57.550 --> 01:34:00.060
那可是我老爸
That's my freakin' father!

01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:02.140
推进器恢复了
Thrusters are back up.

01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:18.000
-我们该向上飞  -不行
- We should be going up! - We can't!

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
伊戈想毁掉我们所知的宇宙
Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.170
我们得杀了他
We have to kill him.

01:34:22.170 --> 01:34:23.090

Rocket!

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.970
好嘞
Got it!

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:40.050
那我们又要拯救银河系了
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:41.130
大概是吧
I guess.

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.300
太棒了
Awesome!

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.620
如果我们救了两次银河系
We're really gonna be able to jack up our prices

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:48.550
就能坐地起价了
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:51.270
我真不敢相信你居然想到了这个
I seriously can't believe that's where your mind goes.

01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:54.130
就是想想嘛  哥们  我们不是朋友嘛
It was just a random thought, man. I thought we were friends.

01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:56.630
我当然在乎那些星球啊  建筑啊
Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings

01:34:56.630 --> 01:34:58.750
和各个星球上的动物啊
and all the animals on the planets.

01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:00.050

And the people.

01:39:51.630 --> 01:39:53.190
这主意糟透了
That's a terrible idea.

01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:55.810
我们就剩这一个主意了
Which is the only kind of idea we have left.

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.200
难以置信
Unbelievable.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.250
"火箭  做这个  火箭  做那个"
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:03.470
今天真够受的
What a day.

01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:14.770
好了  首先你打开这个开关  再打开这个
All right, first you flick this switch, then this switch.

01:40:14.770 --> 01:40:16.300
这样就启动了
That activates it.

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:18.570
接着你按下这个按钮
Then you push this button

01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:21.330
让你有五分钟时间逃跑
which will give you five minutes to get out of there.

01:40:21.710 --> 01:40:23.350
不管你做什么
Now, whatever you do

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:25.930
千万别按这个按钮
don't push this button

01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:28.160
因为那样会立即引爆炸弹
because that will set off the bomb immediately

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.710
我们就都没命了
and we'll all be dead.

01:40:29.710 --> 01:40:32.330
重复一遍我刚才说的
Now, repeat back what I just said.

01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.080
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.590
-我是格鲁特  -对了
- I am Groot. - That's right.

01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:38.190
-我是格鲁特  -不
- I am Groot. - No!

01:40:38.190 --> 01:40:40.520
不对  这个按钮会杀死所有人
No, that's the button that will kill everyone!

01:40:40.930 --> 01:40:41.980
再来
Try again.

01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:45.860
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:47.920
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:49.860
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:51.820
不  你刚才就是这么错的
No! That's exactly what you just said!

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:53.670
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.710
你应该按哪个按钮
Which button is the button you're supposed to push?

01:40:55.710 --> 01:40:56.800
指一下
Point to it.

01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:58.830
不对
No!

01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:00.470
你让他紧张了
You're making him nervous!

01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:02.370
闭嘴  给我拿点胶带来
Shut up and get me some tape!

01:41:02.370 --> 01:41:04.020
外面有人有胶带吗
Does anybody have any tape out there?

01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.790
我要把死亡按钮贴上胶带
I wanna put some tape over the death button.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.120
我没胶带  我去问问
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:11.390
勇度  你有...
Yo, Yondu... do you have...

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.930
你有胶带吗
Do you have any tape?

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.800
卡魔拉  你有胶带吗
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:20.330
胶带
Tape!

01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:21.930
算了
Never mind.

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:26.590
德拉克斯  你有胶带吗
Drax, do you have any tape?

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.150
对  透明胶也行
Yes, scotch tape would work.

01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:31.740
既然你没有  为什么还要问我
Then why did you ask me if scotch tape would work,

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.010
透明胶行不行
if you don't have any?

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.520
没人有胶带
Nobody has any tape!

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:37.630
谁都没有胶带吗
Not a single person has tape?

01:41:37.630 --> 01:41:38.230
没有
Nope!

01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:39.940
你问过星云了吗
Did you ask Nebula?

01:41:40.710 --> 01:41:41.400
问过了
Yes!

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:42.600
你确定吗
Are you sure?

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.950
我问勇度的时候
I asked Yondu...

01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:46.670
-她就坐在他旁边  -我就知道你撒谎
- and she was sitting next to him. - I knew you were lying!

01:41:46.670 --> 01:41:49.580
你包里装着价值连城的电池还有一枚原子弹
You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag.

01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:51.340
要说谁会带胶带  就是你了
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:55.030
我就想说这个  什么事都得我做
That's exactly my point! I have to do everything!

01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:57.390
你浪费了多少时间
You are wasting a lot of time here!

01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:05.510
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.

01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:09.890
后推进器又坏了
Rear thrusters are out again!

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:12.460
没那个发电机我们死定了
We're done for without that generator!

01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:27.360
银河护卫队
Guardians...

01:42:28.110 --> 01:42:30.220
也许这对你们会是个安慰
perhaps it will provide you solace

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.840
你们的死  不会毫无意义
that your deaths are not without purpose.

01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:34.700
而是会警告那些
They will serve as a warning

01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:37.180
想要背叛我们的人
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:40.670
别想耍索维林族
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:45.740
会很疼的
This is gonna hurt.

01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:47.300
光说不练
Promises, promises.

01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:10.940
不
No!

01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:15.530
不不不
No! No! No!

01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.380
要爆炸了
We're gonna blow!

01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:28.030
彼得  不
Peter! No!

01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:48.340
怎么了
What?

01:43:48.970 --> 01:43:50.700
你活像玛丽·波平斯
You look like Mary Poppins.

01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:52.290
他酷吗
Is he cool?

01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:55.490
当然  他很酷
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:58.370
我是玛丽·波平斯哦
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:27.540
螳螂  小心
Mantis, look out!

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.300
她只是昏过去了
She's just unconscious.

01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.010
炸弹还有多久炸
How long until the bomb goes off?

01:44:59.010 --> 01:45:01.760
万一万一格鲁特没把我们都炸死
In the unlikely event that Groot doesn't kill us all...

01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:03.290
那还有六分钟
about six minutes.

01:45:07.930 --> 01:45:10.690
克拉林  我们需要飞行舱来带我们撤离
Kraglin, we need the quadrant for an extraction.

01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:11.470
倒计时5分钟
T-minus five minutes.

01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:12.540
是  船长
Aye, Captain.

01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:19.480
克拉林到时  上面得有人接应
Somebody's gotta be up top when Kraglin arrives.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.790
德拉克斯  带螳螂走
Drax, take Mantis.

01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:25.730
我的乳头
My nipples!

01:45:33.630 --> 01:45:34.810
卡魔拉
Gamora!

01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:40.060
彼得
Peter!

01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:07.500
别想多了
Get over it.

01:46:07.670 --> 01:46:11.500
得了  彼得  我知道你并不想这样
Come now, Peter. I know this isn't what you want.

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.450
我让你做出这样的选择  还算什么父亲啊
What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice?

01:46:48.010 --> 01:46:49.060
帅气
Yeah!

01:46:50.110 --> 01:46:54.010
很快  彼得  我们就将成为一切
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:57.860
别再惹我生气了
So stop pissing me off!

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.680
我们得上去撤离点
We have to get up to the extraction point!

01:47:27.330 --> 01:47:28.140
冲
Go!

01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:29.170
我说过
I told you...

01:49:29.410 --> 01:49:32.830
我不想一个人做
I don't want to do this alone.

01:49:36.490 --> 01:49:38.140
你不能拒绝
You cannot deny

01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:42.180
宇宙赋予你的人生目的
the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.

01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:53.400
大家不要靠近
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.660
那是什么
What is that?

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.290
不非得如此的  彼得
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:16.840
你为什么要毁掉我们的机会
Why are you destroying our chance?

01:50:19.930 --> 01:50:22.880
别再否认自己的身份了
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:26.570
你是上亿
One in billions.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.640
上兆  甚至更多中的唯一
Trillions. Even more.

01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:36.590
生命怎么可能有更伟大的意义
What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?

01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:43.110
我不是用脑袋控制箭的  孩子
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

01:50:43.670 --> 01:50:45.720
我是用心
I use my heart...

01:51:19.630 --> 01:51:24.630
<b>Fleetwood Mac - "The Chain"</b>

01:51:20.690 --> 01:51:24.490
你不该杀了我妈妈  还捏碎我的随身听
You shouldn't have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.

01:51:24.630 --> 01:51:27.830
<i>♪And if you don't love me now.</i>

01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:31.020

01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:07.880
格鲁特  如果你听得到  快点
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:11.130
我不确定奎尔还能分散他注意力多久
I'm not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted!

01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:12.650
格鲁特  快点
Groot, hurry!

01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:11.140
勇度  我们要炸了
Yondu, we're about to blow!

01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:12.550
上船
Get to the ship!

01:53:12.730 --> 01:53:14.020
不能丢下奎尔
Not without Quill!

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.250
你还得照顾小树枝
You need to take care of the twig!

01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:19.140
不能丢下你
Not without you!

01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:23.520
我这辈子都没做过几件好事  耗子
I ain't done nothin' right my whole damn life, rat.

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:28.770
让我做这件吧
You need to give me this.

01:53:39.490 --> 01:53:41.680
一套太空服和一个飞行装置
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

01:53:42.090 --> 01:53:43.690
我一样只有一个
I only have one of each.

01:53:56.590 --> 01:53:58.510
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:53:59.010 --> 01:54:00.110
他说什么
What's that?

01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:06.110
他说  "欢迎加入他娘的银河护卫队"
He says, "Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."

01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:08.690
而且他用的词不是"他娘的"
Only he didn't use "Frickin'."

01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:16.290
再见  小树枝
Bye, twig.

01:54:18.190 --> 01:54:21.150
我们回头得好好谈谈你说粗话的问题
We're gonna need to have a real discussion about your language.

01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:17.470
彼得呢
Where's Peter?

01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.710
火箭  他在哪
Rocket, where is he?

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:21.900
火箭
Rocket.

01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:23.840
火箭  看着我  他在哪
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:32.590
不  我不能丢下他
No. I'm not leaving without him.

01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:40.580
对不起
I'm sorry.

01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:43.710
我今天只能承受失去一个朋友
I can only afford to lose one friend today.

01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:46.240
克拉林  走
Kraglin, go!

01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:47.160
等等
Wait...

01:55:48.270 --> 01:55:49.310
奎尔回来了吗
Is Quill back?

01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:53.400
火箭  奎尔呢
Rocket, where's Quill?

奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:06.400
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:16.520
不  我们得阻止它
No, we need to stop it.

01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:18.010
我们得阻止它
We need to stop it.

01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:23.180
不  停下
No. Stop.

01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.790
停下  听着  听我说
Stop. Listen. Listen to me!

01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:27.530
你是个神
You are a god.

01:56:28.590 --> 01:56:29.890
如果你杀了我
If you kill me...

01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:32.790
你就跟其他人一样了
you'll be just like everybody else.

01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:35.890
那有什么不好
What's so wrong with that?

01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:37.240
不
No!

01:57:27.490 --> 01:57:31.330
他或许是你生父  孩子  但他可不是你爸爸
He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.850
真抱歉我一件事都没做对
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:40.850
你是我的孩子我太走运了
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:45.880
什么
What?

01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.610
勇度  你干什么
Yondu, what are you doing?

01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:00.700
不行
You can't.

01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:03.470
勇度
Yondu!

01:58:08.710 --> 01:58:09.550

No!

01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:15.910
不
No!

01:58:19.150 --> 01:58:21.810
不不
No! No!

01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:24.540
不要
No!

01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.650
我告诉卡魔拉
I told Gamora

01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:21.760
我小时候
how when I was a kid

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:24.830
会假装大卫·霍索夫是我爸爸
I used to pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

01:59:26.850 --> 01:59:29.890

I don't know if that's possible.
