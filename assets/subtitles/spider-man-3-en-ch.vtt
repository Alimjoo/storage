对  内德  你什么都不用说

06:58.600 --> 07:00.220
我只有一个问题...
I just have one question...

07:00.220 --> 07:02.550
当MJ告诉你  彼得是蜘蛛侠的时候...
When MJ told you that Peter was Spider-Man...

07:02.550 --> 07:04.480
-等会儿等会儿...   -咋了
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...   -What's up?

07:04.480 --> 07:07.420
我比MJ知道得早  我是蜘蛛侠的幕后帮手
I knew way before MJ did. I was Spider-Man's guy in the chair.

07:07.420 --> 07:08.630
哦  这个我了解
Oh, I know about those.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.360
老弟  我这儿大半的人都是干幕后技术活的
Dude, half my guys are guys in the chair.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.680
就是啊  你懂了吧

07:11.680 --> 07:14.270
是我帮他找到秃鹫的

07:14.270 --> 07:15.040

07:15.040 --> 07:18.330
我还帮过他黑进他的战服  算是帮他去了太空
And I helped him hack his suit once, and kinda helped him get to Space.

07:18.330 --> 07:22.700
所以  在蜘蛛侠的非法私警活动中  你是他的主要同谋喽
So, in Spider-Man's illegal vigilantism, you were his main accomplice.

07:25.770 --> 07:28.570
我想把我的话从记录上删掉可以吗
I would like to have my words stricken from the record.

07:28.570 --> 07:29.900

07:29.900 --> 07:32.020
我希望你能明白

除非你对我们有明确的指控
unless you have some real specific charges to throw at us,

07:35.330 --> 07:37.940
要不然从法律上来讲  你无权把我们拘留在这里

你绝对应该找个律师
You should definitely lawyer up.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.600

07:43.450 --> 07:44.830
这个男孩被托付给你
The boy was entrusted to you,

07:44.830 --> 07:47.300
作为他的法定监护人  你基本上算是他母亲
and as his legal guardian, essentially his mother,

07:47.310 --> 07:51.500
你不仅放任他祸害自己  还鼓励这种行为
you not only allowed him to endanger himself, but you actually encouraged it.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.950
这还不算违法吗
Who does that?

07:53.380 --> 07:55.070
我现在就要见彼得
I wanna see Peter right now.

07:55.320 --> 08:00.670
史塔克工业今日被卷入蜘蛛侠和神秘客的争端中
Stark Industries was caught in the web of the Spider-Man-Mysterio controversy today,

08:00.670 --> 08:05.630
联邦调查员已对失踪的史塔克科技产品展开调查
when federal agents opened an investigation into missing Stark technology.

08:05.970 --> 08:08.510
调查员需要了解具体有哪些产品丢失...
The agents wanna know exactly what was taken...

08:08.510 --> 08:10.240
-至少他们用了张好看的照片   -以及是否...
-At least they used a good picture.   -and whether or not...

08:10.240 --> 08:11.850
又出啥事了
What is happening?

08:14.610 --> 08:16.580
那太好了  谢谢
That's great. Thank you.

08:17.020 --> 08:18.620
彼得  我这有好消息
Well, I have some good news, Peter.

08:18.620 --> 08:21.210
我相信对你的任何指控都不会成立
I don't believe any of the charges against you are gonna stick.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.140
等等  真的吗
Wait, seriously?

08:22.140 --> 08:24.000
-哦  我就知道   -太棒了
-Oh, I knew it.   -Nice.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.510
我的天啊  默多克先生  太谢谢了  这真的...
Oh, my God, Mr. Murdock. Thank you. That's...

08:25.510 --> 08:27.290

-Thank you, Matt.   -That's amazing.

08:27.430 --> 08:28.360
-不谢   -简直完美
-You are welcome.   -Perfect. 

08:28.360 --> 08:30.090
-但是...霍根先生   -好的
-However... Mister Hogan?   -Okay.

08:30.090 --> 08:33.610
-咋了   -联邦调查局正在积极调查失踪的那些设备
-Yes?   -The feds are actively investigating the missing technology.

08:33.700 --> 08:36.380
我理解你对斯塔克先生和他的公司十分忠诚
I understand you're loyal to Mr. Stark and his legacy,

08:36.380 --> 08:37.720
但如果你被牵扯在内的话...
but if you were involved...

08:37.830 --> 08:39.730
-什么叫  如果我被牵扯在内   -我建议你请律师
-If I was involved?   -I might secure a lawyer.

08:39.730 --> 08:42.700
我需要律师...呃...  因为我被调...  我以为他会...
I need a lawyer because I'm un... I'm under inves... I thought, he was...

08:42.700 --> 08:44.770
你说不会有指控了  我可以这么说...
you said, there's no charge. I can say, un...

08:44.770 --> 08:47.200
在律师的建议下  我拒绝回答这个问题
under advisement of counsel, I refuse to answer the question

08:47.200 --> 08:50.130
无意冒犯  因为...我的回答可能会让我进监狱
respectfully because I... the answer could incriminate me.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.530
《好家伙》里有句话  怎么说来着
It's in Goodfellas. What's the thing they say in Goodfellas?

08:50.130 --> 08:52.530
*注：《好家伙》是马丁·斯科西斯执导的黑帮犯罪影片

08:52.530 --> 08:54.310
我知道你想说什么...冷静下好吗
I know, that's what you think... Calm down.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.010
让我们听听他怎么说  马特
Let's hear what he has to say. Matt?

08:56.020 --> 08:57.780
你得请个好律师
You're gonna need a really good lawyer.

08:59.060 --> 09:02.280
彼得  你可能躲过了法律上的麻烦  但事情还没完呢
Peter, you may have dodged your legal troubles, but things will get much worse.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.380
舆论的箭更伤人
There is still the court of public opinion.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.400
杀人犯  神秘客万岁
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

09:12.000 --> 09:13.720
你怎么做到的
How did you just do that?

09:14.170 --> 09:15.620
因为我是个好律师
I'm a really good lawyer.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.480
我们相信神秘客

09:17.530 --> 09:19.520
我们得找个更安全的住处
We're gonna need a safer place to live.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.190
哦  这个
Oh. Ah.

09:32.190 --> 09:34.010
我们怎么...关掉这个
How do we... how do we?

09:34.050 --> 09:35.660
警报系统  已解除
Alarm systems, deactivated.

09:38.790 --> 09:40.630
看上去不错  这里...
It looks nice and this is....

09:40.630 --> 09:41.600
也挺安全
safe.

09:44.740 --> 09:47.860
欢迎来到心灵绿洲
Welcome, to the spiritual oasis.

09:48.290 --> 09:49.660
你喜欢小金刚吗
You like Donkey Kong Jr.?

09:51.750 --> 09:53.890
来自新泽西的尼基  热线已为您接通
Nicky from Jersey City, you're on the line.

09:53.890 --> 09:56.470
我不是说我不想纪念复仇者联盟哈
I'm not saying I don't want to honor the Avengers,

09:56.470 --> 09:59.220
但是  不是以这种方式纪念啊
but, you know, not doing it this way.

09:59.220 --> 10:02.590
把美国队长的盾牌放在自由女神像上
Putting the Captain America shield on the Statue of Liberty?

10:02.600 --> 10:04.850
不行  那样看起来太荒唐了
Nah, that will look ridiculous.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.560
别打自由女神像的主意
Leave the Statue of Liberty alone.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.550
哦  哈皮
Oh, Happy.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.380
你交申请了吗

I literally just finished my MIT one. You?

10:13.360 --> 10:14.910
-我也   -想想看要是咱们都进了
-Same.   -Imagine if we both got in?

10:14.910 --> 10:16.800
-还有内德   -对啊  但是...
-And Ned?   -Yeah, but...

10:16.800 --> 10:19.580
我们必须拿到奖学金  才真的能去
We have to get scholarships so we could actually go.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.940
得了吧  你成绩又好  绩点又高  而且...
Come on. You got the scores, and the grades, and...

10:21.940 --> 10:25.160
-你觉得我太现实了   -呃  不不不  不是的
-You think I'm being too pragmatic.   -No, no, no, no. Well...

10:25.980 --> 10:27.290
是有一点  但问题不大
Kind of. That's okay.

10:27.290 --> 10:28.710
我最喜欢你的这个特点
That's one of my favorite things about you.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.050

-Really?   -Yeah.

10:30.050 --> 10:31.840
哦  那你还喜欢我什么
Well, what are your other favorite things?

我就喜欢你是个无所畏惧的乐天派
I love your relentless optimism.

10:33.470 --> 10:36.080

Yeah. I am a "glass half full" kind of gal.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.730
我很喜欢跟谁都玩得来的你
I really like how you're a people person.

10:37.730 --> 10:38.940
我可喜欢跟人打交道了
I love people.

10:38.940 --> 10:40.530
超级...喜欢
Love 'em... so much.

10:40.530 --> 10:41.430

You like sports.

10:41.430 --> 10:43.600
我觉得纽约大都会队今年也会一路过关斩将的
I think the Mets are gonna go all the way this year.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.850
-真的吗   -那是什么声音
-Really?   -What's that noise?

10:45.980 --> 10:48.580
噢  那个是...是哈皮  你看
Oh. That's... that's Happy. Look.

10:49.030 --> 10:51.770
他把他的房间给梅姨了  他就只能睡这下面了
He gave his room to May, so he's sleeping down here.

10:55.550 --> 10:57.750
问你个奇怪的问题
I have a weird question.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.770
你对这一切有没有感到释然
Does any part of you feel relieved about all of this?

11:04.920 --> 11:07.170
从我被那只蜘蛛咬了之后...
Ever since I got bit by that Spider...

11:08.770 --> 11:12.490
我只过了一周正常的生活
I've only had one week, where my life has felt normal.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.060
或者说算得上正常吧  我猜
Or kind of normal, I guess

11:15.580 --> 11:16.590
然后...
And...

11:18.060 --> 11:19.660
那一周就是你发现我身份的时候
That was when you found out.

11:19.660 --> 11:22.020
因为那时  我希望我身边能知道真相的人
Because then, everyone that was in my life

11:22.030 --> 11:24.140
都知道了
that I wanted to know, knew.

11:24.140 --> 11:25.370
这样就刚刚好
And it was perfect.

11:25.370 --> 11:27.550
但现在变成了众人皆知  而...
But now everybody knows. And...

11:29.260 --> 11:32.600
我成为了万众瞩目的焦点...
I am the most famous person in the entire world...

11:33.540 --> 11:34.920
...尽管如此我仍旧家徒四壁
... and I'm still broke.

11:39.330 --> 11:43.020
我...很期待明天和你见面
I'm... excited to see you tomorrow.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.280
嗯  我也是
Yeah, me too.

11:46.470 --> 11:47.770
别聊了
Wrap it up.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.090
你们俩情投意合  我们都懂的  快挂了
You both like each other. We get it. Hang up.

11:50.090 --> 11:52.800
再怎么聊也没有新创意的  明白吗  我可是要睡足八小时的
There's no new ground being broken. Okay? I need my eight hours.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.940
-你一直都在听我们聊天吗   -嗨  哈皮
-Have you been listening this whole time?   -Hi, Happy.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.340

13:44.660 --> 13:46.410
你想走就走...

-或者从走廊荡过去...   -没错
-Or, or swing through the hallway...   -Yeah.

13:48.230 --> 13:50.520
-或者从天花板爬过去  躲开其他人也行啦   -没错
-Or crawl on the ceiling to avoid everybody.   -Yeah.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.840
我们相信你可以的
We all know you can do it.

13:51.840 --> 13:52.840
那我就打算...
I'm just gonna...

13:52.840 --> 13:54.850
-我知道你做了什么   -你别哪壶不开提哪壶了
-I know what you did.   -Stop it. You're embarassing yourself.

13:54.850 --> 13:55.810
我就是知道...
Know what you did...

13:55.810 --> 13:57.150
他就爱信阴谋论
He's a conspiracy theorist.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.260
我们能不能   就在这上面待一整天呢
Can we just like, stay up here all day?

14:13.260 --> 14:15.710
-下面太疯狂了  -等一下  看看这条
-It is so crazy down there.   -Wait, this one's good.

14:15.710 --> 14:16.750
有人说
Some suggest that,

14:16.750 --> 14:21.260
帕克的超能力包括雄蛛特有的催眠雌性功能
Parker's powers include the male spider's ability to hypnotize females.

14:21.270 --> 14:24.160
-他借此色诱琼斯-沃森   -什么鬼
-Which he used to seduce Jones-Watson   -What?

14:24.160 --> 14:26.340
-使其无可救药地爱上邪恶的他   -得了吧  别念了

14:26.340 --> 14:27.220
你别念了行吗
Will you stop?

14:27.230 --> 14:29.440
遵命  我的蜘蛛大人
Yes, my Spider-lord.

14:37.230 --> 14:38.970
总算有点私人空间了
Finally. Some privacy.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.830
下面真的太疯狂了
It is so crazy down there.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.460
话说回来  我在想...
So, I was thinking...

14:43.920 --> 14:45.660
等我们进了麻省理工
When we get into MIT,

14:45.660 --> 14:47.050
我们应该住在一块
we should live together.

14:47.510 --> 14:48.380
可以啊
Yeah, for sure.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.620
嗯  我觉得行
Yeah. Love that.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.930
-这将是我们的未来生活   -是的
-This is gonna be us.   -Yes.

14:52.930 --> 14:55.050
除开那个飞盘  还有笑脸
Minus the frisbee. And the smiling.

14:55.050 --> 14:56.980
麻省理工是我们的梦中情校...
MIT's obviously the dream...

14:56.980 --> 14:58.980
但如果我们都再申请一样的保底学校
But if we match-up our backup schools,

14:58.980 --> 15:01.300
到时候不管怎样  我们都能一起去波士顿
either way, we'll all be together in Boston.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.380
新的学校  新的城市  我在那儿也能当蜘蛛侠
New school, new town. I can Spider-Man there.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.210
-波士顿那儿肯定也有违法犯罪啥的   -对对对  肯定有
-I mean they have crime in Boston, right?   -Yes. Yes, they do.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.260
没错  那种相当恶劣的犯罪
Yeah, wicked crime.

15:06.260 --> 15:08.110
对吧  这是一个全新的开始
Yeah, so it'll be like a fresh start.

15:10.550 --> 15:11.510
怎么了
What's up?

15:12.040 --> 15:13.970
我也说不好  我就是感觉如果你不...
I don't know. I just feel like if you don't...

15:14.450 --> 15:16.530
如果你做好会失望的准备
If you expect disappointment,

15:16.530 --> 15:19.030
那你就永远不会真的失望
then you can never really get disappointed.

15:19.030 --> 15:20.080
振作点
Come on.

15:21.650 --> 15:22.750
全新的开始呢
It'll be a fresh start.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.410
我们三个一起
And, we'll all be together.

15:26.220 --> 15:27.790
没错  你说得对
Yeah. You're right.

15:27.790 --> 15:29.280
-新的开始   -没错
-Fresh start.   -Yeah.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.810
新的开始
Fresh start.

15:36.190 --> 15:37.410
第一封回信送到了
First one's here!

15:41.910 --> 15:44.050
没关系  这只是个保底的学校
It's okay. It's a backup school.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.090
彼得
Peter?

15:48.460 --> 15:49.300
没过吗
No?

15:51.960 --> 15:53.140
最后一个了
Last one.

15:54.630 --> 15:55.610
麻省理工的吗
MIT?

16:12.710 --> 16:13.630
好了
Okay.

16:15.050 --> 16:16.570
-准备好了吗?   -琼斯...
-Ready?   -Jones...

16:16.570 --> 16:18.900
我不是让你把万圣节装饰都拆下来吗..
I told you to take down the Halloween decorations...

16:18.900 --> 16:20.730
其实你是叫萨沙去拆的  所以...
Actually, that was Sasha, so...

16:20.730 --> 16:22.530
废话少说  你照做就是了
Enough attitude, just do it.

16:23.890 --> 16:24.920
这就去
On it.

16:26.310 --> 16:28.150
-我紧张得要吐了   -憋着
-I feel like I'm gonna puke.   -Well, don't.

16:28.150 --> 16:30.050
不然老板还得让我打扫
Because, he will just make me clean it.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.570
这是我们唯一的机会了
This is our only shot.

16:31.570 --> 16:32.930
要么上岸  要么完蛋
It's here, or nowhere.

16:32.930 --> 16:34.090
嘿  乐观一点
Hey! Come on.

16:34.090 --> 16:35.800
-好吧  你们准备好了吗   -准备好了
-Okay. You guys ready?   -Yeah.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.510
好的  我数到三
Okay. On three.

16:37.620 --> 16:38.570
一
One

16:38.960 --> 16:39.960
二
Two

16:40.380 --> 16:41.420
三
Three

17:04.110 --> 17:04.810
被拒了
No.

17:05.350 --> 17:07.110
我也  你呢
No. You?

17:08.400 --> 17:12.810
"鉴于最近发生的争议  我们目前无法
"In light of recent controversy, we are unable to

17:12.810 --> 17:15.280
考虑你的申请"
consider your application at this time."

17:15.540 --> 17:17.050
这太不公平了
This is so not fair.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.100
我是说这太不公平了  我没做错什么
I mean, this is so not fair. I didn't do anything wrong.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.380
你们俩更没有做错什么
And you guys definitely didn't do anything wrong.

17:22.590 --> 17:25.720
如果你做好会失望的准备  你就永远不会真的失望
Expect disappointment, and you will never get disappointed.

17:27.390 --> 17:30.200
今夜无眠  波-波-
No sleep till Bo-Bo-

17:30.630 --> 17:33.790
波-波-波士顿我来了!
Bo-Bo-Boston!

17:39.210 --> 17:40.270
你们没被录取吗
You guys didn't get in?

17:40.270 --> 17:43.040
对啊  因为我们是蜘蛛侠的真朋友
Yeah. Because we're actually friends with Spider-Man.

17:44.970 --> 17:46.100
呃  对了...
Uhh, yeah...

17:46.510 --> 17:50.040
我该走了  我有一场新生联谊会要参加...
I better get going. There's a, mixer for new admissions...

17:50.040 --> 17:52.150
抱歉了...伙计们
And... sorry, guys.

17:52.350 --> 17:54.200
琼斯  你干嘛呢  快给我去干活
Jones, what are you doing? Get back to work.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.540
好的  来了
Yeah. Coming.

17:55.900 --> 17:56.880
你知道吗
You know what?

17:58.860 --> 18:00.520
再来一次  我还是会做同样的选择
I wouldn't change a thing I did.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.220
我也一样
Me neither.

18:06.380 --> 18:09.050
不过我还是得把这封信拿给爸妈看
Although, I could just showed this letter to my parents.

19:19.160 --> 19:19.890
呃...
Umm....

19:19.890 --> 19:20.740
嗨
Hi.

19:23.660 --> 19:24.540
嗨
Hi!

19:25.760 --> 19:26.840
我是...
I'm...

19:27.360 --> 19:30.300
世界上最出名的人  我知道你
The most famous person in the world. I know.

19:31.610 --> 19:35.450
我是王  小心别滑倒  我们这儿可没有职工责任险
Wong. Try not to slip. We don't have liability insurance.

19:38.730 --> 19:41.110
-这是准备办一场假日派对吗?   -不是
-Is all this for a holiday party?   -No.

19:41.110 --> 19:43.920
有个传送门是连通西伯利亚的
One of the rotunda gateways connects to Siberia.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.010
暴风雪刮进来了
Blizzard blasted through.

19:47.940 --> 19:52.170
因为某人忘了每个月施一次维护咒把门封严实了
Because someone forgot to cast monthly maintenance spell to keep the seals tight.

19:52.180 --> 19:55.620
没错  就是他忘了  因为他忘了我现在有更重要的责任
That's right. He did. Because he forgot I now have higher duties.

19:55.620 --> 19:56.800
更重要的责任
Higher duties?

19:56.800 --> 19:59.160
至尊法师有更重要的责任  没错
The Sorcerer Supreme has higher duties, yes.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.120
等下  我以为你才是至尊法师
Wait, I thought you were the Sorcerer Supreme?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.850
现在理论上来讲他才是
No. He got it on a technicality

20:02.850 --> 20:04.660
因为我被烁灭了五年
'cause I blipped for five years.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.430
哦  好吧  恭喜
Oh. Well, congratulations.

20:06.430 --> 20:07.700
如果我当时在的话  那我...
If I'd been here, then I'd...

20:07.700 --> 20:08.990
早就把这里烧没了
Burned the place down.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.160
你俩继续  我没叫你们停下呢
You two, no one said stop shoveling.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.510
所以彼得...
So, Peter...

20:12.700 --> 20:14.400
什么风把你吹来了
To what do I owe the pleasure?

20:14.590 --> 20:15.740
对了  嗯...
Right. Umm...

20:15.980 --> 20:17.620
很抱歉打扰你  先生  但是...
I'm really sorry to bother you, sir, but...

20:17.620 --> 20:20.030
拜托  我们一起拯救了半个宇宙诶
Please. We saved half the universe together.

20:20.030 --> 20:21.970
你不用那么客气叫我先生
I think we're beyond calling me sir.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.700
好吧  呃...史蒂芬
Okay, uhh... Stephen.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.680
感觉怪怪的  但我允许你这么叫
That feels weird, but I'll allow it.

20:28.140 --> 20:29.150
当...
When...

20:29.930 --> 20:32.170
当神秘客泄露我身份的时候
When Mysterio revealed my identity...

20:33.010 --> 20:35.620
我的整个生活被搅得一团糟
My entire life got screwed up, and...

20:35.940 --> 20:38.360
我就在想  虽然我也不知道这样可不可行
I was wondering, I mean, I don't even know if this would actually work,

20:38.360 --> 20:39.700
但我在想  如果...
but I was wondering if...

20:41.730 --> 20:44.550
也许你能穿越到过去然后阻止这一切发生呢
Maybe you could go back in time and make it so that he never did?

20:46.360 --> 20:47.270
彼得
Peter

20:47.620 --> 20:51.960
我们扰乱了时空的稳定性  复活了无数的生命
we tampered with the stability of space-time to resurrect countless lives.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.500
你想再来一次  就因为你的生活出了岔子
You wanna do it again now just because yours got messy?

20:54.510 --> 20:58.000
这不是...为了我  我是说  这件事真的伤害了很多人
This isn't... it's not about me. I mean, this is really hurting a lot of people.

20:58.090 --> 20:58.910
我的...
My...

20:59.180 --> 21:01.010
我的梅姨  哈皮...
My Aunt May, Happy...

21:01.250 --> 21:03.620
还有我的死党  我女朋友  他们的未来都被毁了
My best friend, my girlfriend, their futures are ruined just

21:03.620 --> 21:05.330
仅仅因为他们认识我  而且...
because they know me, and...

21:05.510 --> 21:06.690
他们没有做错什么
They've done nothing wrong.

21:06.690 --> 21:09.350
我很抱歉  但是...
I am so sorry, but...

21:09.950 --> 21:11.360
即使我愿意这么做
even if I wanted to...

21:12.140 --> 21:14.740
时间宝石也已经不在我这儿了
I don't have the Time Stone anymore.

21:16.850 --> 21:17.890
也是哦
That's right.

21:21.660 --> 21:24.710
抱歉...打扰你了
I'm really sorry if I... wasted your time.

21:24.710 --> 21:27.180
-没事儿...   -当我没问过吧
-No, you didn't...   -Just forget about it please.

21:27.180 --> 21:30.690
放心吧  他记性差着呢
He will. He's really good at forgetting things.

21:31.860 --> 21:34.880
王  你倒让我想起个好主意
Wong. You've actually generated a good idea.

21:34.880 --> 21:35.710
啥
What?

21:35.850 --> 21:37.820
卡夫卡符咒
The runes of Kof-Kol.

21:38.020 --> 21:39.990
卡夫卡符咒
The runes of Kof-Kol.

21:39.990 --> 21:42.100
哦  就是个普通的遗忘咒语
Oh, it's just a standard spell of forgetting.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.380
不会逆转时间  但至少能让别人忘记你是蜘蛛侠
Won't turn back time, but at least people will forget that you were ever Spider-Man.

21:45.380 --> 21:47.340
-真的么   -不 别当真
-Seriously?   -No. Not seriously.

21:47.350 --> 21:50.940
那个咒语穿越已知和未知现实之间的黑暗边界
That spell travels the dark borders between known and unknown reality.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.250
它很危险
It's too dangerous.

21:52.730 --> 21:54.690
天哪  咱不是为了一点儿小事就用过吗
God, we've used it for a lot less.

21:54.690 --> 21:57.240
你还记得卡玛泰姬的满月派对吗
Do you remember the full moon party in Kamar-Taj?

21:57.240 --> 21:58.780
-不记得   -你看
-No.   -Exactly.

22:01.970 --> 22:03.730
拜托  老王
Come on. Wong.

22:05.150 --> 22:07.000
你瞧他都这么惨了
Hasn't he been through enough?

22:14.040 --> 22:15.720
出事儿了别再找我擦屁股
Just leave me out of this.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.740
不找就不找
Fine.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.740
得
Fine.

22:31.860 --> 22:33.260
这是什么地方
So what is this place?

22:34.170 --> 22:38.110
至圣所建在宇宙能流交汇处
The Sanctum's built at the intersection of cosmic energy currents.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.330
我们最先发现了这地方
We were the first to seek them out.

22:40.330 --> 22:43.270
这里有些墙体已有数千年历史了
Some of these walls are thousands of years old.

22:43.890 --> 22:47.150
80年代还有人在这儿拍摄过电影《伸冤人》呢
And they shot an episode of Equalizer here in the 80's.

22:47.730 --> 22:48.850
呃  我...
Well, I, umm...

22:50.560 --> 22:53.100
我非常感谢你为我这么做  先生
really appreciate you doing this for me, sir.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.340
没关系
Don't mention it.

22:56.050 --> 22:57.510
也不用叫我先生
And don't call me sir.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.060
哦对  抱歉
Right. Sorry.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.510
准备好了吗
You ready?

23:02.470 --> 23:03.650
我准备好了
I'm ready.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.670
很高兴认识你  蜘蛛侠
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.380
等下  你说啥
Wait, excuse me?

23:14.880 --> 23:18.260
全世界都要忘记彼得·帕克就是蜘蛛侠
The entire world is about to forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.600
-包括我在内   -所有人吗
-Including me.   -Everyone?

23:22.080 --> 23:23.390
不能留几个例外吗
Can't some people still know?

23:23.390 --> 23:25.440
咒语不是这样用的
That's not how the spell works.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.720
施法过程很难随意改变  而且异常危险
Very difficult and dangerous to change it mid-casting.

23:29.020 --> 23:31.330
那我女朋友也会忘记我们的种种过往吗
So my girlfriend is just gonna forget about everything we've been through?

23:31.330 --> 23:32.940
我是说  那样她还是我女朋友吗
I mean, is she even gonna be my girlfriend?

23:32.940 --> 23:35.340
这取决于她喜欢的是蜘蛛侠还是彼得
That depends. Was she your girlfriend just because you're Spider-Man, or...

23:35.340 --> 23:36.730
我不知道  希望是彼得
I don't know. I really hope not.

23:36.730 --> 23:37.690
好吧  满足你
Alright. Fine.

23:39.290 --> 23:42.200
全世界所有人都会忘记你就是蜘蛛侠  除了...
Everyone in the world is gonna forget you're Spider-Man, except...

23:42.200 --> 23:43.120
你女朋友
your girlfriend.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.600
太谢谢你了...
Thank you so much....

23:45.120 --> 23:46.420
噢天哪  还有内德
Oh, my God. Ned.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.860
内德
Ned!

23:48.720 --> 23:50.260
内德又是哪个
What is a Ned?

23:50.260 --> 23:52.880
他是我死党  我也不想让他忘记我
He's my best friend so it's really important to me that Ned knows.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.310
行吧
Okay.

23:58.830 --> 24:01.890
在我做法的时候别再更改
Let's not change the parameters of the spell anymore...

24:01.890 --> 24:05.180
-咒语参数了   -好的  下不为例
-While I'm casting it.   -Okay, I'm done. I swear I'm done.

24:05.530 --> 24:07.200
但是梅姨也要记得我啊
But my Aunt May should really know.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.930
彼得  别再篡改咒语了
Peter, stop tampering with the spell.

24:08.930 --> 24:11.670
之前当她发现我是蜘蛛侠  情况真的很难办啊
Once she found out that I was Spider-Man, it was really messy, and

24:11.670 --> 24:13.840
我可受不了再来一次
I don't think that I can go through with that again.

24:14.990 --> 24:16.070
-所以算上梅姨了吗   -算
-So, my Aunt May?   -Yes!

24:16.070 --> 24:19.230
-哦  太谢谢了 还有哈皮呢   -不  我不嗨皮我很烦
-Oh, thank you. Happy?   -No. I am annoyed.

24:19.230 --> 24:21.170
不不  这是个昵称  哈罗德·"哈皮"·霍根
No, it's a nickname. Harold "Happy" Hogan.

24:21.170 --> 24:23.190
他曾经和托尼·斯塔克一起工作  然后在...
He used to work with Tony Stark, then he tried dating...

24:23.190 --> 24:26.010
-跟我梅姨约会   -你丫能闭嘴了吗
-My aunt May.   -Could you just stop talking?

24:33.120 --> 24:37.300
基本上  原来就知道我真实身份的人都不该忘
Basically, everyone who knew that I was Spider-Man before, should still know.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.520
-这就成功了吗   -才怪
-Did it work?   -No.

24:59.710 --> 25:03.120
-你六度篡改我的咒语   -五次
-You changed my spell six times.   -Five times.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.900
你改了我的咒语  我明明告诉过你这样不行的
You changed my spell. You don't do that. I told you,

25:05.900 --> 25:07.340
因此
and that is why.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.650
咒语完全失控  要是我没停下的话
That spell was completely out of control. If I hadn't shut it down,

25:10.650 --> 25:12.800
可能会引发灾难
something catastrophic could've happened.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.850
-史蒂芬  对此我实在抱歉...   -叫我先生
-Stephen, listen, I am so sorry...   -Call me sir.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.050
对不起  先生
Sorry, sir.

25:20.200 --> 25:24.050
自从我们一起经历了那些事情  不知何故  我总是会忘记
You know, after everything we've been through together, somehow I always forget...

25:24.460 --> 25:25.970
你只是个孩子
You're just a kid.

25:26.710 --> 25:28.260
听着  帕克  其实
Look, Parker, the problem,

25:28.260 --> 25:29.580
问题不在于神秘客
it's not Mysterio.

25:29.810 --> 25:32.140
而在于你自己  你过着两种截然不同的生活
It's you. Trying to live two different lives.

25:32.140 --> 25:35.650
时间越长就越危险  相信我
And the longer you do that, the more dangerous it becomes. Believe me.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.740
我很抱歉你和朋友们
I'm so sorry about, you and your friends,

25:38.740 --> 25:42.610
没能去上大学  但如果大学真的拒绝你们的话
not getting into college, but if they rejected you, and...

25:42.840 --> 25:46.620
那你就去说服校方再三斟酌  此外别无他法
you try to convince them to reconsider, there is nothing else you can do.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.680
"说服他们"
When you say "convince them",

25:52.140 --> 25:54.820
-你是说  我可以联系他们   -对啊
-you mean like, I could've called them?   -Yeah.

25:55.370 --> 25:56.660
还有这种操作吗
I can do that?

25:57.830 --> 25:59.440
你都没联系过吗
You haven't called?

25:59.440 --> 26:01.540
呃  我收到了他们的来信  就以为...
Well, I mean, I got their letter, and I assumed that...

26:01.540 --> 26:04.540
我打断一下  你是说
I'm sorry, but are you telling me,

26:05.050 --> 26:07.910
你都没先想着去找他们谈谈
that you didn't even think to plead your case with them first,

26:07.920 --> 26:12.100
就来让我给全世界洗脑吗
before you asked me to brainwash the entire world?

26:14.610 --> 26:16.380
你要是这么说的话  那么...

I'm trying to get Ned and MJ a second chance at getting in.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.650

I'm risking a lot just talking to you.

26:51.670 --> 26:53.170
闪电  求求你告诉我
Flash, please help me.

26:53.170 --> 26:54.390
成交  成交  有这么一位女士
Cool, cool, cool. So there's this lady.

26:54.390 --> 26:56.750
她是那儿的助理副校长  你可以去求她帮忙
She's the assistant vice chancellor. You can plead your case with her.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.990
很好  棒极了  她在哪儿
Okay, perfect. Where is she?

26:57.990 --> 26:59.590
-她走了   -到哪去了
-She left.   -To go where?

26:59.590 --> 27:00.750
机场
To the airport.

27:07.010 --> 27:08.860
斯塔克网络  无法访问
Stark Network, unavailable.

27:09.490 --> 27:11.920
面部识别  无法启用
Facial recognition, unavailable.

27:15.490 --> 27:16.410
嗨
Hi.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.020
对  我看得见你
Yep. I can see you.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.190

-And that's Peter Parker.   -Mom?

27:35.190 --> 27:36.910
-嘿   -妈妈
-Hey.   -Mommy.

27:49.830 --> 27:50.830
好吧
Okay.

28:02.210 --> 28:03.130
怎么了
Yeah.

28:03.470 --> 28:04.990
嗨  我是彼得·帕克...
Hi. I'm Peter Parker...

28:04.990 --> 28:06.440
你知道你现在车流中  对吧
You do know you're in the street, right?

28:06.440 --> 28:08.400
我知道  对不起  我只是  我真的得
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just, I really needed to

28:08.400 --> 28:11.010
跟您谈谈  我知道您正要去机场
talk to you, I know you're on your way to the airport...

28:11.010 --> 28:14.230
MJ·沃森和内德·利兹是我这辈子认识的最聪明的两个人
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are the two smartest people I've ever met in my entire life,

28:14.230 --> 28:15.980
我是最笨的那个  因为...
and I'm the dumbest person, because....

28:15.980 --> 28:17.580
我让他们帮我  但如果我没让他们帮我
I let them help me, but if I didn't let them help me.

28:17.580 --> 28:19.370
会有成千上万的人死去  所以求求您  别让...
then millions of people would've died, so please don't...

28:19.370 --> 28:21.090
别让麻省理工像我一样愚蠢而错失两位人才
Don't let MIT be dumb like me.

28:21.090 --> 28:22.640
-你说麻省理工愚蠢   -不是
-MIT is dumb?   -No!

28:22.640 --> 28:25.100
我是说别让它变蠢
I'm saying don't let MIT be dumb.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.620
我是说  就是...
I mean, like the...

28:26.620 --> 28:30.020
不让他们去  那就是比我还蠢
the dumber version of me that wouldn't have let them help.

28:31.050 --> 28:33.100
你没有提前准备一番吧  彼得
You didn't rehearse that, did you, Peter?

28:34.680 --> 28:36.430
总的来说  我想说的是...
Basically, what I'm trying to...

28:44.320 --> 28:45.780
你为什么跑啊  怎么了...
Why are you running? What...

28:49.500 --> 28:53.450
哦  我的天  女士  您得赶紧下车了
Oh, my God. Ma'am? You should get out of the car.

28:53.450 --> 28:55.550
所有人离开大桥
Everybody get off the bridge!

28:57.350 --> 28:59.890
车门被锁住了  车门...嘿
The door is locked. Door's... Hey!

29:17.190 --> 29:18.590
你好啊  彼得
Hello, Peter.

29:19.550 --> 29:20.340
嗨
Hi?

29:20.340 --> 29:21.660
我们...我们认识吗
Have we... Do I know you?

29:21.660 --> 29:23.950
你对我的机器做了什么
What have you done with my machine?

29:23.950 --> 29:26.720
你的机...我不知道你在说什么  什么机器
Your ma... I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know. What machine?

29:26.720 --> 29:31.000
太阳的能量  就掌握在我的手中  它不见了
The power of the sun, in the palm of my hand. It's gone.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.340
听我说  先生  如果你不到处砸车的话
Listen, sir. If you stop smashing cars,

29:33.340 --> 29:36.140
我们可以合作  我可以帮你找你的机器
we could work together and I can help you find your machine.

29:36.140 --> 29:37.650
想玩游戏吗
You wanna play games?

29:40.730 --> 29:41.690
接着
Catch!

29:57.990 --> 30:00.450
好了  你们没事了  你们安全了  快离开这儿
It's okay. You guys are good, you're safe. Get out of here.

30:00.930 --> 30:03.590
你以为你的炫酷新战衣能救你吗
You think your fancy new suit's gonna save you?

30:18.590 --> 30:21.390
当初我就应该抓住机会杀了你的小女友
I should've killed your little girlfriend when I had the chance.

30:25.460 --> 30:26.880
你刚刚说什么
What did you just say?

30:27.210 --> 30:29.300
看来我们是棋逢对手了
Looks like we got competition.

30:49.010 --> 30:51.220
彼得  救命
Peter! Help!

31:13.170 --> 31:15.320
别怕  女士  我这就来
Don't worry, Ma'am! I'm coming!

31:17.350 --> 31:18.870
彼得
Peter!

31:45.620 --> 31:47.240
女士  请你保持冷静
Ma'am, just stay calm.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.590
-深呼吸  你还好吗   -不好
-Just take a deep breath. Are you okay?   -No!

31:52.520 --> 31:55.230
一切都在我的控制之中
I've got it. I've got it all under control.

32:01.890 --> 32:03.700
战衣破损
Suit compromised.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.040
纳米科技
Nanotechnology.

32:06.330 --> 32:08.960
你真是超乎我的意料  彼得
You've outdone yourself, Peter.

32:14.890 --> 32:16.850
是我低估了你
I underestimated you.

32:17.880 --> 32:19.450
但是现在  你要死了
But now, you die.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.610
你不是彼得·帕克
You're not Peter Parker.

32:37.930 --> 32:39.820
我现在真是一头雾水
I am so confused right now.

32:42.170 --> 32:43.370
这是怎么回事
What's happening?

32:43.370 --> 32:45.480
检测到新设备
New device detected.

32:47.030 --> 32:48.650
新设备配对中
Pairing new device.

32:52.070 --> 32:55.000
别听他的  你们要听我的
Don't listen to him, you listen to me.

33:00.790 --> 33:01.620
嘿
Hey.

33:14.820 --> 33:18.070
嘿  嘿  听我的
Hey. Hey! Listen to me.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.710
不  不是他  听我的
No, not him. Me!

33:27.440 --> 33:30.550
女士  你还好吗  快走  你还能赶上飞机
Ma'am are you okay? Come on, you can still make your flight.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.260
彼得
Peter.

33:34.060 --> 33:35.020
你是个英雄
You're a hero.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.520
不是  呃  我...
No. Well, I'm...

33:36.520 --> 33:37.640
不是的  我...
No, I'm...

33:37.640 --> 33:40.470
我会和招生办说说你朋友的事
I'm gonna talk to admissions about your friends,

33:40.660 --> 33:42.370
还有你的事
and I'm gonna talk to them about you.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.480
不  但是  夫人  重点不在我
No, but, Ma'am, this isn't about me.

33:45.600 --> 33:49.260
我会和他们提起你的朋友  还有你
I'm going to talk to them about your friends, and you.

33:49.260 --> 33:50.840
-好吗   -真的吗
-Okay?   -Really?

33:50.840 --> 33:52.490
如果你能安安分分不惹事
And if you keep your noses clean,

33:52.490 --> 33:54.070
说不定你也会有很大的机会
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

33:54.070 --> 33:56.040
好了  让开  我要会会那个男人
Here. Get out of the way. Let me get that man.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.710
嘿  你  我看见你了
Hey. You. I see you.

33:57.710 --> 33:58.790
滚过来
Come here!

33:58.790 --> 34:00.170
你个挨千刀的
That was not okay.

34:00.170 --> 34:01.160
太离谱了
Unbelievable.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.020
你别想着杀我了
Until you stop trying to kill me,

34:07.020 --> 34:08.130
现在是我在控制  老兄
I'm in control, buddy.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.950
我能控制你这一整套触手系统
Of this whole tentacle situation you got going on here.

34:10.950 --> 34:14.080
明白吗  现在告诉我  你是谁  这是怎么回...
Okay? Now, who are you? What is going on...

34:31.440 --> 34:32.410
奥斯本
Osborn?

34:55.400 --> 34:56.100
博士...
Doctor...

35:04.520 --> 35:08.190
许愿的时候小心一点  帕克
Be careful what you wish for, Parker.

35:08.370 --> 35:09.720
放我出去
Let me out of here!

35:09.940 --> 35:12.110
你能不能跟我解释一下这到底是怎么回事
Can you please explain to me what is going on?

35:12.110 --> 35:15.120
你随意施放的那个能让所有人忘记
That little spell that you botched where you wanted everyone to forget

35:15.120 --> 35:18.340
彼得·帕克是蜘蛛侠的小咒语  它开始把每个宇宙中
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, it started pulling in everyone who knows

35:18.350 --> 35:22.900
所有知道彼得·帕克是蜘蛛侠的人  拉进这个宇宙里
Peter Parker is Spider-Man, from every universe, into this one.

35:23.350 --> 35:24.750
从每个宇宙中
From every universe?

35:24.750 --> 35:26.410
你是谁  我这是在哪儿
Who are you? Where am I?

35:26.410 --> 35:28.840
我认为我们最好不要与他们有所交集  因为说实话
I think it's better if we don't engage with them because, frankly,

35:28.840 --> 35:31.380
关于多元宇宙这一概念
the Multiverse is a concept about which we know

35:31.380 --> 35:33.270
我们知之甚少
frighteningly little.

35:33.850 --> 35:35.770
多元宇宙竟然是真的
The multiverse is real.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.720
这本应是不可能的
This shouldn't even be possible.

35:37.720 --> 35:38.950
但我以为你中止施咒了
But I thought you stopped the spell?

35:38.950 --> 35:42.290
没有  我只是把咒语控制住了  但现在看来  依然有漏网之鱼
No, I contained it, but it would appear that a few of them squeaked through.

35:42.580 --> 35:44.780
你离开以后  我发现了另一个世界的来客
After you left, I detected an otherworldly presence.

35:44.780 --> 35:46.400
我追着它到了下水道
I pursued it into the sewers,

35:46.400 --> 35:50.590
在那儿发现了这坨又黏又绿的鬼东西
where I found that slimy, green, son of a gun.

35:50.980 --> 35:51.990
咒语
Spell?

35:52.210 --> 35:53.410
这是魔法吗
Is it magic?

35:53.830 --> 35:55.700
现在是什么情况  谁的生日派对吗
What is this, a birthday party?

35:55.700 --> 35:57.180
这小丑又是谁
Who is this clown?

35:57.330 --> 35:58.510
到底发生了什么
What is this madness?

35:58.510 --> 36:01.770
看好了  你认识名叫彼得·帕克  绰号是蜘蛛侠的人吗
Watch this. Do you know a Peter Parker who is Spider-Man?

36:01.770 --> 36:02.560
我认识
Yes.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.200
-那这是他吗   -不是
-Is that him?   -No.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.130
明白没
See?

36:06.420 --> 36:08.030
好了  我们得这么做
Okay, here's what we gotta do.

36:08.130 --> 36:09.460
我不清楚到底有多少这样的...
I don't know how many of these

36:09.460 --> 36:11.780
-..."访客"   -我在桥上
-visitors we got...   -I saw another one.

36:11.780 --> 36:13.010
还见到了另一个
On the bridge.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.420
他看起来像一个...
He was like a...

36:14.630 --> 36:16.570
会飞的绿妖精
Like a flying green elf.

36:16.570 --> 36:18.780
好吧  听起来他似乎怪可爱的  你要不就从他开始查起吧
Well he sounds jolly. Why don't you start with him?

36:18.780 --> 36:20.800
我需要你把他们抓到这儿来
I need you to capture them and bring them here,

36:20.800 --> 36:22.920
同时我会弄清楚怎么把他们送回去
while I figure out how to get them back.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.960
免得他们破坏现实的结构  或者再不济
Before they destroy the fabric of reality, or worse,

36:25.960 --> 36:27.290
被王发现了
Wong finds out.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.260
奇异博士
Uhh, Doctor Strange?

36:29.260 --> 36:30.590
怎么了
What?

36:30.760 --> 36:34.080
我和我的朋友们刚获得了进麻省理工的第二次机会
My friends and I just got a second chance at getting into MIT.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.960
如果让学校看到我和这些怪物打来打去的...
If the school sees me fighting these crazy monsters...

36:36.970 --> 36:38.450
-嘿  嘴巴给我放干净点   -抱歉
-Hey, watch your mouth!   -I'm sorry.

36:38.450 --> 36:41.130
认真的吗  这时候了还想着上大学
Seriously? Still talking about college?

36:46.950 --> 36:48.720
-你刚才做了什么   -这个
-Hey, what did you just do?   -This.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.380
你怎么做到的
How did you do that?

36:56.380 --> 36:58.170
这叫日积月累  学有所成
Lots of birthday parties.

37:04.350 --> 37:04.990
嘿
Hey!

37:08.640 --> 37:11.070
这么一发射  把他抓进来  然后这事儿就翻篇了  不用谢
One shot, send him here and move on. You're welcome.

37:11.070 --> 37:12.050
开始行动吧
Get to work.

37:12.050 --> 37:13.020
先生
Sir?

37:13.020 --> 37:14.610
又怎么了
Now what?

37:15.990 --> 37:17.660
我知道这是我的烂摊子  我向你保证
I know this is my mess, and I swear to you

37:17.660 --> 37:19.790
我会处理好它的  但是我需要一些帮助
that I'll fix it, but I'm gonna need some help.

37:22.970 --> 37:25.490
我真不敢相信我居然进了至尊圣所
I can't believe I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

37:25.590 --> 37:26.970
呵呵我也是
Neither can I.

37:27.530 --> 37:28.350
所以...
So...

37:28.820 --> 37:31.240
你是怎么知道自己会魔法的  因为我奶奶说过
How did you know you're made of magic? Because my nanna says

37:31.240 --> 37:34.190
我们家族有家传天赋  而且有时我会感觉手有点刺痛...
that we have it in our family and sometimes I get these tinglings in my hand...

37:34.190 --> 37:35.680
那你该去看看医生了
You should talk to your physician.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.460
彼得
Peter!

37:36.460 --> 37:37.870
-嘿   -嘿
-Hey!   -Hey.

37:38.780 --> 37:40.400
我很抱歉把你们给扯进来了
I'm so sorry for dragging you in this,

37:40.400 --> 37:41.610
但我需要你们帮我一起找到这些家伙...
you just gotta help me find these guys...

37:41.610 --> 37:45.200
你不需要道歉  好吗  你给了我们去麻省理工的第二次机会
You don't have to apologize. Okay? You got us a second shot at MIT.

37:45.430 --> 37:48.350
这些坏人是怎么到这儿来的
So, how did the bad guys get here?

37:48.350 --> 37:51.200
为了让你们能够有书读  他把我的咒语搞得一团糟
He screwed up a spell trying to get you into college.

37:51.510 --> 37:54.610
-慢着  我以为是因为你救了那位女士   -你用魔法帮的我们啊
-Wait, what? I thought it was the MIT lady you saved.   -You did it with magic?

37:54.920 --> 37:57.740
救人是施法之后的事了  我们先关注下好消息吧  行吗
No, that was after. Let's just focus on the good news, okay?

37:57.740 --> 37:59.380
不行  我们还是关注下坏消息吧
No, let's just focus on the bad news.

37:59.380 --> 38:04.120
因为到现在  你连一个多元宇宙入侵者都没发现  所以...
As of now, you have detected zero multiversal trespassers, so...

38:04.220 --> 38:05.640
拿出你们的手机
Get on your phones,

38:05.640 --> 38:07.960
搜索全网  然后...
scour the internet, and...

38:08.020 --> 38:10.020
搞定这个烂摊子
Scooby-Doo this shit!

38:10.380 --> 38:12.040
你在指挥我们做事吗
You're telling us what to do,

38:12.040 --> 38:13.470
而这一切都是你的咒语造成的
even though it was your spell,

38:13.470 --> 38:16.430
也就是说  其实主要责任在你
that got screwed up. Meaning that all of this is kind of your mess.

38:16.430 --> 38:17.740
这么说吧  我知道
You know, I know

38:17.740 --> 38:21.550
几个魔法用语  而第一个呢  就是"拜托"
a couple of magic words myself, starting with the word 'please'.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.910
那拜托啦  给我搞定这烂摊子
Please, Scooby-Doo this shit.

38:27.460 --> 38:29.520
你们可以用地下工作室
You can work in the undercraft.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.390
地下工作室
The undercraft?

38:37.060 --> 38:38.390
酷毙了啊
Badass.

38:44.380 --> 38:46.040
伙计们  听好了  关于咒语这件事...
Guys, listen. About this whole spell thing...

38:46.040 --> 38:48.110
完全没问题的
It's totally okay.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.470
-真的吗   -是的
-Wait, really?   -Yeah.

38:49.470 --> 38:51.250
我明白  你只是想...
I mean, I get it. You were...

38:51.250 --> 38:53.490
解决问题罢了...
just trying to fix things...

38:53.490 --> 38:54.710
那...
And so...

38:54.870 --> 38:57.450
或许下次提前知会我们一声
Maybe just run it by us next time, you know?

38:57.650 --> 39:01.530
这样一来  当你想着"嘿  我要做些会...
That way, when you're thinking, "Hey, I'm about to do something that could...

39:01.750 --> 39:04.560
破坏宇宙的事儿"时  我们就能帮上忙了
break the universe", we could like, help you.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.630
一起讨论  或者...
Workshop something, or...

39:06.870 --> 39:09.560
头脑风暴之类的
brainstorm ideas.

39:11.610 --> 39:12.560
没问题
Deal.

39:14.030 --> 39:14.960
内德呢
Ned?

39:15.680 --> 39:19.420
一声"兄弟"大过天  说真的  这没什么大不了的
Oh, dude. I don't care. And seriously, not a big deal.

39:21.390 --> 39:23.290
是酷刑架
A torture rack.

39:24.900 --> 39:27.020
那是普拉提机
That is a pilates machine.

39:27.810 --> 39:28.880
-而这是...   -地牢
-That is...   -The crypt.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.000
好的  那我们得找到剩下的穿越者
Okay, so we get the rest of the guys.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.250
你只用"嗞"他们一下  那位魔法博士会把他们送回去的
You zap them, Doctor Magic will send them back.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.120
然后等我们进了麻省理工
And when we get into MIT,

39:35.120 --> 39:37.120
我请你们吃变味儿的甜甜圈
round of stale donuts, my treat.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.090
一起去抓多元宇宙穿越者吧
Let's catch some multiverse men.

39:39.090 --> 39:39.990
嘿
Hey!

39:40.710 --> 39:42.040
这俩是谁
Who the hell are these two?

39:42.040 --> 39:44.680
他们是我的朋友  这是MJ  这是内德
These are my friends. This is MJ and this is Ned.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.620
你好
Hello.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.600
不好意思  你叫什么来着
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

39:47.600 --> 39:49.860
我是奥托·奥克塔维斯博士
Dr. Otto Octavius.

39:54.490 --> 39:56.210
等下  说真的  你的真名是啥
Wait, no seriously, what's your actual name?

39:56.210 --> 39:57.920
噢  那是恐龙吗
Oh, is that a dinosaur?

40:19.820 --> 40:21.940
如果油漆洗不掉  就把它带来收容所  我来帮你洗
If the paint won't come off, bring it by the shelter. I'll get it out.

40:21.940 --> 40:23.280
不不不  梅姨
No, no, no, May.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.150
我们得先找到这些人
We gotta find these guys first.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.210
好吧  那就先完成你的任务  然后再过来
Well, finish your mission, then come by.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.210
我们要举办罐头食品活动
We are having a canned food drive.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.330
-这样可以诶   -我找到了一个  我找到了一个
-That could work.   -I got one, I got one, I got one.

40:31.330 --> 40:33.290
-梅姨  我得走了   -好的  爱你呦  拜拜
-Oh, May? I gotta go.   -Okay. Love you. Bye.

40:33.290 --> 40:35.090
人是死的
I mean you can take the guy out of the chair

40:35.090 --> 40:37.330
办法是活的
but you can't take the chair out of the guy.

40:37.330 --> 40:38.370
你找到什么了
What did you find?

40:38.370 --> 40:39.750
呃...
There's a...

40:39.750 --> 40:43.390
城外一处军事研究设施发生了骚乱
disturbance near a military research facility outside of the city.

40:43.620 --> 40:47.480
据目击者称  有怪物在天上飞
And witnesses say they saw a monster flying through the air.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.860
肯定是我在桥上看到的那个家伙  对吧
That's gotta be the guy I saw on the bridge, right?

40:50.860 --> 40:52.170
这不可能
That's impossible.

40:54.770 --> 40:56.160
你认识他  对吗
You know him, don't you?

40:57.190 --> 40:59.110
在桥上的时候  你叫了他的名字
On the bridge, you said his name.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.030
诺曼·奥斯本
Norman Osborn.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.220
一名出色的科学家
Brilliant scientist.

41:04.650 --> 41:06.150
军事研究专家
Military researcher.

41:07.230 --> 41:08.850
但他贪婪成性
But he was greedy.

41:08.850 --> 41:10.400
最终误入歧途
Misguided.

41:10.400 --> 41:14.750
-他怎么了   -我们真是受够你的问题了  小子
-What happened to him?   -We tire of your questions, boy!

41:15.550 --> 41:16.930
好吧...
Okay...

41:17.880 --> 41:19.640
我得走了  是哪来着
I gotta go. Where am I going?

41:19.640 --> 41:21.380
那不可能是他的
It can't be him.

41:23.270 --> 41:24.210
为什么
Why?

41:24.650 --> 41:28.280
因为诺曼·奥斯本几年前就死了
Because Norman Osborn died years ago.

41:29.290 --> 41:31.570
所以要么我们看到的是别人
So either we saw someone else,

41:32.960 --> 41:37.620
要么就是你将遁入黑暗  和鬼魂斗智斗勇
or you're flying out into the darkness, to fight a ghost.

42:01.150 --> 42:04.110
盯好这片树林  我们还不知道那人在哪
Keep an eye out on those trees, we don't really know where this guy is.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.410
真不知道你怎么能在这种情况下还不呕吐的
I genuinely don't know how you do this without throwing up.

42:27.980 --> 42:29.190
你们看到了吗
Did you guys see that?

42:30.560 --> 42:32.980
-啥都没看到   -乌漆嘛黑的
-No.   -It's, it's really dark.

42:53.740 --> 42:54.950
发生什么了
What's happening?

42:54.950 --> 42:56.610
彼得  怎么了
Peter, what is it?

42:58.510 --> 43:00.100
你的蜘蛛第六感来了吗
Are you getting the tingle thing?

43:00.100 --> 43:02.340
是你的蜘蛛感应起作用了吗
Is the tingle thing happening? Is your tingle tingling?

43:11.650 --> 43:12.920
你们看到了吗
Are you guys seeing this?

43:12.920 --> 43:13.850
看到了
Yeah.

43:14.340 --> 43:15.510
-奥斯本   -不
-Osborn?   -No.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.290
他是绿的  这个人是蓝的
He was green. This guy's blue.

43:18.380 --> 43:21.040
你不会碰巧来自另一个宇宙吧
You wouldn't happen to be from another universe, would you?

43:22.370 --> 43:23.680
他在干嘛
What's he doing?

43:23.680 --> 43:25.250
不知道  看起来像是在充电
I don't know. Looks like he's charging.

43:25.250 --> 43:27.410
看着不太妙啊  快网住他吧
I don't like this. Just web him.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.280
往左  左边  对对
Go left, left! Go left! Yes！

43:43.280 --> 43:47.700
别瞎指挥  等会  往右  右边
What are you talking about? Wait! Right, right!

43:47.700 --> 43:48.510
-伙计们   -别听他的
-Guys!   -Don't listen to him.

43:48.510 --> 43:50.270
你们这是帮倒忙啊
This is not helping!

43:57.460 --> 43:58.860
哦不  发生什么了
No, no, no. What happened?

43:58.860 --> 44:00.160
彼得  彼得
Peter? Peter?

44:07.680 --> 44:08.710
哇哦
Whoa.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.240
彼得  是我  弗林特·马尔科  你记得吗
Peter, it's me. Flint Marko. You remember?

44:13.240 --> 44:15.180
我是彼得  但是不是你认识的彼得
I'm Peter, but I'm not your Peter.

44:15.180 --> 44:18.050
你不是我认识的彼得  什么意思  发生什么了
What do you mean you're not my Peter? What the hell is going on?

44:18.050 --> 44:20.830
我会跟你解释的  但能不能先帮我阻止那个家伙
I'll explain everything, but first can you help me stop this guy?

44:20.830 --> 44:21.790
好的
Okay.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.980
你尽量包围他  我去把电给断了
You try to surround him and I'll pull the plug.

44:23.980 --> 44:25.300
好的  上吧
All right, let's go.

44:39.470 --> 44:41.970
我快坚持不住了
I can't hold him much longer.

44:42.830 --> 44:44.320
我来了  好了
I got him. I got it.

45:12.180 --> 45:14.440
不一样的彼得  奇奇怪怪
Different Peter. Weird.

45:14.630 --> 45:15.530
谢啦
Thanks.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.970
-不好意思   -问题不大
-Sorry.   -Don't worry about it.

45:25.810 --> 45:27.400
我的身体恢复了
I got my body back.

45:28.220 --> 45:29.720
嘿  呃...
Hey, umm...

45:30.120 --> 45:32.080
这听上去很扯  但是...
This is gonna sound really crazy, but...

45:32.080 --> 45:33.800
这不是你们所属的宇宙
this isn't your universe.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.430
-另一个宇宙吗   -嗯哼
-Another universe?  -Uh huh.

45:35.430 --> 45:37.760
-什么   -我刚刚就感受到了
-What?   -That's what I was feeling.

45:37.940 --> 45:40.600
这股能量  截然不同
The power. It's different.

45:41.980 --> 45:43.020
我很喜欢
I like it.

45:45.220 --> 45:46.770
放轻松  伙计
Easy, buddy.

45:47.110 --> 45:48.710
你们来到这里  其实是我的错
It's actually my fault that you're here.

45:48.710 --> 45:52.150
你是说来到这个宇宙  还是树林啊
Like the universe? Or the woods?

45:52.570 --> 45:55.370
-我恨树林   -我是说这个宇宙  先生
-I hate the woods.   -I meant the universe, sir.

45:55.370 --> 45:59.050
所以要怎样  你们就看我光着屁股站在这吗
So what? You guys just gonna stand there and act like I ain't butt-ass naked?

45:59.050 --> 46:02.090
-对哦   -呃  不是的  我...
-I am.   -Uhh, no, no... I...

46:14.350 --> 46:15.950
那是什么
What was that?

46:15.950 --> 46:18.010
-你对他做了什么  -不不  别担心  没事的
-What did you just do to him?   -No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

46:18.010 --> 46:19.460
-你杀了他吗   -哇哦  听着
-Did you kill him?   -Whoa, listen.

46:19.460 --> 46:21.540
我会解释一切  你相信我就好  求你了
I can explain everything. You just have to trust me, please.

46:21.540 --> 46:24.360
我才不信你  我又不认识你
I don't trust you. I don't know you.

46:27.040 --> 46:28.280
这是什么
What is this?

46:29.650 --> 46:31.170
你站错队了
You picked the wrong side.

46:33.780 --> 46:34.900
康纳斯
Connors?

46:36.500 --> 46:37.460
什么
What?

46:37.620 --> 46:38.720
你认识这个生物
You know this creature?

46:38.720 --> 46:41.520
哦不不  不是什么生物  他是个人
No, no, no, no. Not a creature. A man.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.150
他们来自同一个宇宙
From same universes.

46:44.150 --> 46:46.620
科特·康纳斯博士  他是位科学家  
Dr. Curt Connors. He was a scientist

46:46.620 --> 46:48.530
跟我一样在奥氏集团工作
in Oscorp when I worked there.

46:48.630 --> 46:49.890
他是个很出色的科学家
A brilliant scientist.

46:50.250 --> 46:52.290
直到他把自己变成了一只蜥蜴
Till he turned himself into a lizard.

46:52.290 --> 46:55.020
然后他想把整个城市的人都变成蜥蜴  真是疯了
Then he tried to turn the whole city into lizards. It was crazy.

46:55.020 --> 46:59.080
不疯狂好吗  麦克斯  这就是人类进化的新方向
It wasn't crazy, Max. It was the next step in human evolution.

46:59.080 --> 47:00.210
恐龙说话了
The dinosaur can talk.

47:00.210 --> 47:00.950
-是蜥蜴   -哦对
-Lizard.   -Right.

47:00.950 --> 47:02.790
那么  你又是怎么回事
Speaking of which, what happened to you?

47:02.790 --> 47:06.660
我记得你之前  一口烂牙  是个四眼仔  头还秃了
Last I recall, you had bad teeth, glasses and a comb-over.

47:06.660 --> 47:08.980
你是去整形了吗
Did you get a makeover?

47:09.410 --> 47:11.980
你知道我可以给你来个真正的全身大整吧
You know I can give you a real makeover.

47:11.980 --> 47:14.140
-让我猜猜看  是把我整成一只蜥蜴吗   -没错
-Let me guess. Into a lizard?   -Exactly.

47:14.140 --> 47:17.110
你们俩能闭嘴吗  我们到底在哪
Could you two just shut up? Where are we?

47:17.110 --> 47:18.840
-这事有点复杂   -一个巫师的地牢
-It's complicated.   -A wizard's dungeon.

47:18.850 --> 47:20.750
巫师的...巫师的地牢
Wizard's... Wizard's dungeon?

47:20.750 --> 47:22.170
没有别的好解释了
There's no real way to sugarcoat that.

47:22.170 --> 47:24.380
这就是一个巫师的地牢
It's literally the dungeon of a wizard.

47:24.380 --> 47:26.000
听着  我不抢你的魔法
Look, you can keep your magic.

47:27.010 --> 47:29.970
我只想感受下之前的那股新能量
I want a taste of that new energy I just felt.

47:33.110 --> 47:34.010
哦  彼得  嘿
Oh, Peter. Hey.

47:34.010 --> 47:35.920
嘿  那些家伙过去了吗
Hey. Did those guys come through yet?

47:36.160 --> 47:38.210
应该有一个电人和一个沙人
There should be an electric guy and a sand guy.

47:38.210 --> 47:40.590
是的  他们都关在这儿
Yeah. They're all here and locked up.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.480
太好了  我还要在这多待一会儿
Perfect. I'm gonna just stay here for a bit,

47:42.480 --> 47:45.770
试着修复一下损坏的设施  省得他们又怪到我头上
and try to fix this damage so they don't blame it on me again.

47:45.770 --> 47:48.200
-好的   -嘿  我想说...
-Okay.   -Hey, I...

47:49.050 --> 47:51.250
没有你  这些我都办不到  所以...
I couldn't do any of this without you, so...

47:51.250 --> 47:53.120
-谢谢你   -嗯呐  没事
-Thank you.   -Yeah, of course.

47:53.270 --> 47:56.080
嘿  帮我问一下他  这是个树怪
Hey, ask him if this is like a tree monster,

47:56.080 --> 47:58.580
还是一个变成树的科学家
or like a scientist that turned into a tree.

47:58.580 --> 48:00.230
这不就是棵树吗  兄弟
Is this a tree, man?

48:00.780 --> 48:01.790
那就是一棵树
That's a tree.

48:18.820 --> 48:19.940
懦夫
Coward.

48:20.300 --> 48:22.390
有个新的世界等着我们去征服
We have a new world to conquer.

48:24.360 --> 48:27.760
-你让我感到恶心   -别烦我  求你了
-You make me sick.   -Leave me alone. Please.

48:27.760 --> 48:30.840
躲藏在阴影里...
Hiding in the shadows...

48:30.870 --> 48:33.190
-逃避真实的自己   -不
-Hiding from who you truly are.   -No!

48:34.420 --> 48:37.590
你无法逃避真实的自己
You can't escape yourself!

48:52.960 --> 48:54.350
-嘿  梅姨   -嘿  彼得
-Hey, May.   -Hey, Peter.

48:54.350 --> 48:56.130
我正上班呢  呃...
I'm at work, and, umm...

48:56.510 --> 48:58.770
你要找的一个人刚刚走了进来
One of the guys you're looking for just walked in.

49:07.570 --> 49:10.170
梅姨  她在哪  谢谢
May? Where's May? Thank you.

49:15.910 --> 49:18.540
嘿  他来了
Hey, here he is.

49:18.540 --> 49:19.550
诺曼
Norman,

49:19.550 --> 49:21.390
这是我的侄子
this is my nephew.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.910
诺曼·奥斯本  我以为你已经...  
Norman Osborn? I thought that you were...

49:25.910 --> 49:29.790
我在这里的广告上看见了蜘蛛侠
I saw Spider-Man in an ad for this place.

49:30.430 --> 49:32.560
于是我想着他能帮帮我
And I thought he could help me.

49:32.900 --> 49:34.240
但你不是他
But you're not him.

49:34.740 --> 49:36.420
等等  所以你想要蜘蛛侠的帮助
Wait, so you want Spider-Man's help?

49:36.420 --> 49:39.010
他就这么走了进来
He just wandered in.

49:41.290 --> 49:43.200
我不知道还能去哪
I didn't know where else to go.

49:44.700 --> 49:47.050
我的房子里住着其他人
Someone's living in my house.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.640
奥氏集团都不存在
Oscorp doesn't exist.

49:52.180 --> 49:53.530
我的儿子...
My son...

49:57.440 --> 49:58.910
有时候
Sometimes,

49:59.080 --> 50:00.590
我甚至都不是我自己
I'm not myself.

50:01.810 --> 50:03.050
我就好像...
I'm...

50:03.440 --> 50:04.640
是另一个人
someone else.

50:04.640 --> 50:07.660
而且每次他控制身体的时候  我就什么都记不得  
And, everytime he's in control, I can't remember.

50:07.660 --> 50:09.560
-现在我在这儿  在这个地方    -是谁呢
-And now, I'm here, in this place,   -Who is in control,

50:09.560 --> 50:11.190
-诺曼  是谁在控制你...   -在这座城市  我也不知道...
-Norman, who is in control...   -in this city, I don't know...

50:11.190 --> 50:14.080
-我不知道...我不知道我身上发生了什么   -没事
-and I don't know... I don't know what's going on with me.  -Okay.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.000
-我没有...我不明白怎么回事   -嗯嗯
-I don't... It doesn't make sense.   -Yeah.

50:17.540 --> 50:19.670
他迷失了
He's lost.

50:19.670 --> 50:21.560
我并不是单指在这个宇宙
And I don't mean just in the cosmos.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.380
他的脑子也不大清醒
I mean in his mind.

50:26.180 --> 50:27.700
他们都是这个样子吗
Are they all like this?

50:28.360 --> 50:29.450
是的
Yeah.

50:29.450 --> 50:32.940
我的意思是  他们或多或少都有点精神上或身体上的问题
Well, I mean they all have their own, mental or physical issues.

50:32.940 --> 50:36.480
哦  他需要帮助  也许他们都需要
Well, he needs help, but maybe they all do.

50:37.080 --> 50:38.720
你该不会是想...不  梅姨  这...
What, you don't mean... No, May, this...

50:38.720 --> 50:39.840
这不关我的事
This isn't my problem.

50:40.110 --> 50:42.930
彼得  真的不关你的事吗
Peter, not your problem? Mmm?

50:42.940 --> 50:43.940
梅姨...
May...

50:44.250 --> 50:47.760
他们回去的话  得到帮助的可能性要大得多
Their chance of getting help is way better back where they came from.

50:47.770 --> 50:49.620
把他们送回家
Sending them home,

50:49.630 --> 50:51.340
这是我们能为他们做的最好的事情
That's the best thing that we can do for them.

50:51.340 --> 50:52.480
为了他们
For them?

50:52.690 --> 50:54.340
还是为了你自己
Or for yourself?

50:56.880 --> 50:58.630
看看你周围
Look around you.

50:58.630 --> 51:00.210
我们就是做这个的
This is what we do.

51:00.210 --> 51:01.310
我们帮助他人
We help people.

51:01.320 --> 51:04.350
把他们送回去  才是对他们最好的做法
This is what's best, for them.

51:05.070 --> 51:06.280
相信我
Trust me.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.360
但是事实依旧如此
But the fact remains,

51:10.360 --> 51:12.900
蜘蛛侠是个威胁
Spider-Man is a menace!

51:13.420 --> 51:14.440
广告之后  马上回来
We'll be right back,

51:14.440 --> 51:17.800
号角牌每日营养补充剂
after a brief word from Daily Bugle supplements.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.420
您的另一样每日所需 
The only other Daily fix you need.

51:20.650 --> 51:21.910
完毕
And, we're out.

51:24.830 --> 51:25.760
什么
What?

51:28.740 --> 51:29.960
我看见他们了
I got eyes on them.

51:29.960 --> 51:31.420
他和他的阿姨  还有一个我不认识的人一起
He's with his aunt and some guy I don't know.

51:31.420 --> 51:32.230
你确定吗
You sure?

51:32.230 --> 51:33.510
他们正离开收容所
They're just leaving the shelter.

51:33.510 --> 51:35.300
好的  不要跟丢他
Okay. Don't lose him.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.600
谢谢你  梅
Thanks, May.

51:47.760 --> 51:49.270
希望能再见到你
Hope to see you again.

51:49.500 --> 51:50.480
嘿
Hey.

51:50.540 --> 51:51.960
他信任你
He trusts you.

51:52.370 --> 51:53.440
我也是
So do I.

51:55.340 --> 51:56.790
多谢你帮我把战服洗干净
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

51:57.720 --> 51:59.010
待会见
I'll see you later.

52:01.100 --> 52:04.130
-伙计们  这是奥斯本先生   -嘿  是奥斯本博士
-Guys, this is Mr. Osborn.   -Hey, it's Doctor.

52:04.130 --> 52:05.150
抱歉  呃...
Sorry. Umm...

52:05.150 --> 52:08.070
奥斯本博士  他们是我的朋友  内德和MJ
Dr. Osborn, these are my friends, Ned and MJ.

52:08.520 --> 52:09.530
玛丽·简
Mary Jane?

52:09.530 --> 52:11.870
其实是米歇尔·琼斯
It's Michelle Jones, actually.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.330
真是不可思议
Fascinating.

52:19.140 --> 52:22.060
你们觉得还有其他内德·利兹们吗
Do you think there are other Ned Leedses?

52:34.800 --> 52:35.800
奥克塔维斯
Octavius?

52:40.140 --> 52:41.100
奥斯本
Osborn

52:42.360 --> 52:44.970
-你...发生了什么   -你怎么会...
-What... What happened to you?   -What happened to...

52:46.320 --> 52:49.130
-你真是一具行尸走肉   -你什么意思
-You're the walking corpse.   -What do you mean?

52:49.130 --> 52:51.770
你已经死了  诺曼
You died, Norman.

52:52.300 --> 52:53.730
很多年前就死了
Years ago.

52:54.200 --> 52:55.460
你疯了
You're insane.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.490
天哪  我喜欢这里
God, I love it here.

52:57.490 --> 52:59.270
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

52:59.510 --> 53:01.800
-他就站在这里  他没…   -他死了
-He's standing right there. He's not...   -Dead.

53:02.710 --> 53:05.830
他们都死了  在同蜘蛛侠的战斗中命丧黄泉
They both died fighting Spider-Man.

53:09.280 --> 53:11.020
新闻已经公布他们的死讯了
It was all over the news.

53:11.310 --> 53:12.460
绿魔呢
Green Goblin?

53:12.870 --> 53:16.350
被你自己的滑翔机刺穿了
Impaled by the glider he flew around on.

53:16.860 --> 53:18.560
接着几年后...
And a couple of years later...

53:18.730 --> 53:20.800
你  章鱼博士
You. Doc Ock.

53:20.980 --> 53:22.730
和你的机器一块沉河了
Drowned in the river with your machine.

53:22.730 --> 53:24.300
胡说八道
That's nonsense.

53:24.700 --> 53:27.650
蜘蛛侠试图阻止我研发聚变反应堆
Spider-Man was trying to stop my fusion reactor.

53:28.020 --> 53:29.560
我制止了他
So I stopped him.

53:30.060 --> 53:33.980
我掐住了他的喉咙...然后我...
I had him, by the throat.... And then, I...

53:38.590 --> 53:39.920
我就到这里来了
And then I was here.

53:39.920 --> 53:42.000
哦  拜托  听我说吧
Oh, please. Let me tell you something.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.250
我当时把蜘蛛侠揍得屁滚尿流  不信你问他
I was whooping Spider-Man's ass. He'll tell you.

53:45.250 --> 53:48.030
然后他造成了电力超载  我卡着动不了
And then he caused an overload. I was stuck in the grid,

53:48.030 --> 53:51.700
一直在吸收能量  就要变成纯净能量体了  然后...
absorbing data. I was about to turn into pure energy, and then...

53:53.700 --> 53:55.920
然后...哦  该死
And then... Oh, shit.

53:57.210 --> 53:58.040
然后我就快死了
I was about to die.

53:58.040 --> 54:01.430
麦克斯  你知道我死了吗
Max, do you know? Do I die?

54:05.090 --> 54:06.890
-哦  太好了  你又抓到了一个   -等等  
-Oh, great. You caught another one.   -No, wait.

54:06.890 --> 54:08.890
斯特兰奇  他不是危险人物
Strange, he's not dangerous.

54:10.970 --> 54:12.330
没关系
It's okay.

54:14.980 --> 54:16.120
那是什么
What is that?

54:16.130 --> 54:19.070
一件远古神器  科达莫斯方盒
It's an ancient relic. The Machinati Codamus.

54:19.070 --> 54:22.670
把你搞错的咒语封印进去  一旦我做法完成
Trap your corrupted spell inside, once you finished the proper ritual,

54:22.670 --> 54:26.770
它会逆转咒语  将那些人送回他们的宇宙
it will reverse the spell. And send these guys back to their universes.

54:26.770 --> 54:29.290
然后呢  我们就死翘翘了
And then what? We perish?

54:29.290 --> 54:31.610
别了吧  谢谢  我拒绝
Nah. No thanks, I'll pass on that.

54:31.610 --> 54:34.300
让我出去  彼得
Let me out of here. Peter!

54:34.710 --> 54:36.090
斯特兰奇...
Strange...

54:36.310 --> 54:38.590
我们不能把他们送回去  至少现在还不行
We can't send them back. Not yet.

54:39.010 --> 54:39.970
为什么
Why?

54:41.440 --> 54:43.580
他们中有些人一回去就必死无疑
Some of these guys are gonna die.

54:43.580 --> 54:44.720
帕克...
Parker...

54:45.540 --> 54:47.480
这是他们的宿命
it's their fate.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.330
拜托  斯特兰奇  有点同情心吧
Come on, Strange. Have a heart.

54:51.990 --> 54:54.860
在多元宇宙宏大的运行中
In the grand calculus of the multiverse,

54:55.200 --> 54:58.670
他们的牺牲比他们的生命重要得多
their sacrifice means infinitely more than their lives.

55:04.790 --> 55:06.260
对不起  孩子
I'm sorry, kid.

55:07.190 --> 55:09.700
他们死了就是死了
If they die, they die.

55:23.440 --> 55:24.420
彼得
Peter!

55:38.080 --> 55:38.810
别这样
Don't!

55:42.060 --> 55:44.870
-兄弟  你在干什么   -彼得  你快走  快
-Dude, what are you doing?   -Peter, you gotta go. Go!

55:47.540 --> 55:49.560
这就是我选择丁克的原因
This is why I never had kids.

56:03.780 --> 56:05.580
-把盒子给我   -不
-Give me the box.   -No.

56:06.440 --> 56:07.590
哇
Whoa!

56:23.420 --> 56:24.710
天哪  我死了啊
Oh, my God. I'm dead.

56:25.190 --> 56:28.260
你没死  只是灵魂出窍了
You're not dead. You've just been separated from your physical form.

56:28.260 --> 56:29.990
出窍了...什么意思
My physical... What?!

56:30.800 --> 56:33.970
-你是怎么做到的   -我不知道
-How are you doing that?   -I have no idea.

56:33.970 --> 56:36.080
这不可能
You should not be able to do that.

56:36.080 --> 56:38.120
这感觉绝了啊
This feels amazing.

56:48.910 --> 56:50.930
这可能是我遇到过最酷的事情了
That might be one of the coolest things that's ever happened to me.

56:50.930 --> 56:52.240
但仅此一次  下不为例
But don't ever do that again.

56:59.210 --> 57:00.690
嘿  放开我
Hey. Get off of me!

57:49.150 --> 57:50.090
这是什么地方
What is this place?

57:50.090 --> 57:53.170
这是我掌控下的镜像空间
The Mirror Dimension. Where I'm in control.

58:02.250 --> 58:05.340
斯特兰奇  住手  我们能不能谈一谈
Strange, stop. Can we please just talk about this?

58:05.340 --> 58:07.890
帕克  你难道不知道吗  在多元宇宙中
Parker, don't you realize that in the multiverse,

58:07.890 --> 58:12.630
有不计其数的人知道彼得·帕克就是蜘蛛侠
there are an infinite number of people who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

58:12.630 --> 58:15.530
如果那个咒语出了问题  他们都会涌进这个宇宙的
And if that spell gets loose, they're all coming here.

58:15.530 --> 58:18.570
我知道  我明白  但是我们不能让他们就这样回去送死
Look, I know. I get it. But we can't just send them home to die.

58:18.620 --> 58:19.990
这是他们的宿命
It's their fate.

58:20.430 --> 58:23.520
你无法改变这一点  正如你无法改变他们的身份
You can't change that anymore than you can change who they are.

58:23.520 --> 58:27.220
如果我们可以改变他们的命运呢
But what if we could? What if we can change their fate?

58:28.650 --> 58:30.020
你要干什么
What are you doing?

58:35.030 --> 58:36.520
我不会还给你的...
I'm not giving you the...

58:47.550 --> 58:49.040
还给我
Give me that back.

59:09.760 --> 59:12.270
等等  那是阿基米德螺线吗
Wait a minute, is that an Archimedean spiral?

59:12.270 --> 59:14.600
镜像空间居然是几何构造  你很擅长几何啊  
The Mirror Dimension is just geometry? You're great at geometry.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.270
几何题难不倒你啊
You can do geometry.

59:17.950 --> 59:21.390
半径的平方除以曲线上的顶点数...
Square the radius, divided by, plot points along the curve...

59:21.390 --> 59:24.870
好了  帕克  等结束后我再来接你
It's over, Parker. I'll come pick you up when it's done.

59:27.870 --> 59:31.490
嘿  斯特兰奇  你知道比魔法更神奇的是什么吗
Hey, Strange. You know what's cooler than magic?

59:35.330 --> 59:36.640
数学
Math.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.150
别这样做
Don't do this.

59:40.520 --> 59:41.290
噢
Oww.

59:41.290 --> 59:42.860
对不起  先生  但是...
I'm sorry, sir, but...

59:47.250 --> 59:48.560
我必须要试一试
I have to try.

59:51.540 --> 59:52.230
兄弟  发生什么了
Dude, what happened?

59:52.230 --> 59:54.210
我刚刚和奇异博士打了一架  我赢了
I just had a fight with Doctor Strange and I totally won!

59:54.210 --> 59:56.620
-什么   -看  我还偷了他的戒指
-What?   -Look, and I stole his ring thing.

59:57.020 --> 59:59.470
我本来荡着蛛丝飞过城市  然后就穿进了...
I was swinging through the city, and then I went through this...

59:59.470 --> 01:00:01.210
一个巨大的镜像空间里
massive mirror thing,

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:02.860
-然后我又回到了城里了   -他人呢  他在哪
-and then I was back in the city.   -Where is he? Where is he?

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.740
他被困住了  但是...
He's trapped, but...

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.920
我不知道他会被困多久
I'm not sure for how long.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.070
你本可以不管我们死活的
You could've just left us to die.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.220
为什么要帮我们
Why didn't you?

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:09.790
因为见死不救  就不是他了
Because that's not who he is.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.370
我应该可以帮助你们
I think I can help you guys.

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:17.030
如果我能治好你们  让你们恢复正常
If I can fix what happened to you,

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.250
等你们回去的时候  一切就会不一样了
then when you go back, things will be different

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:21.640
你们可能就不会死在与蜘蛛侠的战斗中
and you might not die fighting Spider-Man.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.710
你说治好我们什么意思
What do you mean fix us?

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:25.380
-听着  我们的科技很先进   -我可以帮你
-Look, our technology is advanced...   -I can help you.

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:29.090
那个...我自己也是个科学家
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.480
奥克塔维斯了解我的能力
Octavius knows what I can do.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.230
治好  你当我们是小狗吗
Fix? You mean like a dog?

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:36.380
我不要
I refuse.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.460
我没办法向你们承诺什么
I can't promise you guys anything,

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.530
但至少这样你们就可以回到自己的时空  多次机会
but at least this way, you actually get to go home and have a chance.

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:43.140
改过自新的机会
A second chance.

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:45.430
想想看啊  难道不值得一试吗
I mean, come on. Isn't that worth trying?

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:46.890
相信我  彼得...
Trust me, Peter...

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:49.010
当你想改变别人
When you try to fix people,

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:51.750
就得承担得起后果
there are always consequences.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:53.460
那你可以不来呀
I mean, you don't have to come.

01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:55.480
我之前都不知道你还能说话呢
I also didn't know that you could talk.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.150
但如果你们要留在这里
But if you stay here...

01:00:57.730 --> 01:00:59.330
就得想办法对付那个巫师了
you're gonna have to deal with the wizard.

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:02.020
所以  我们要么跟你走要么死
So, we go along, or die.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.930
基本上没得选啊  对吧
Not much of a choice, is it?

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:05.160
我只想回家
I just wanna go home.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.840
我个人来讲的话  还不太想死
Well, I myself don't wanna be killed,

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.300
更别说死在一个奇装异服的人手里  所以...
especially by a guy dressed like Dungeons & Dragons, so...

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.720
你打算怎么办
What's your plan?

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.000
一切都在我的掌控之中
I have it all under control.

01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:21.640
这玩意儿怎么办
What are we gonna do about this thing?

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.000
我们得找个地方好好保管它吧
Well, we need to find somewhere safe for it, right?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.630
-对对对  -你拿去吧
-Yeah. Yes. Yes.   -You got to take it.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:26.210
等等  啥
Wait, what?

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:28.620
如果出事了  我就给你发短信  你就按这个按钮
If something bad happens, I'll text you, and then you just push this

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.060
一切就结束了  他们都会消失
and then it's all over, and they'll all be gone.

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.400
我们要跟你一起去  我们不会丢下你一个人
We're going with you. We're not gonna leave you.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.730
你们不能去  太危险了  你们做的已经够多了
You can't come with me. It's too dangerous. You guys have already done enough.

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.100
-彼得  我们要共进退   -我知道  内德
-Peter, we're in this together.   -I know we're in this together, Ned,

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.890
但我不能明知有危险还让你们去
but I can't do this if I know that you're in danger.

01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:42.150
好吗  MJ  你拿着吧  就当是为了我
Okay? So for me, Mj please just take this.

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.520
求你了
Please.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.450
-好吧   -谢谢你
-Fine.   -Thank you.

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:50.660
但是彼得  我发誓如果你失联了  我也会按下按钮的
But Peter, I swear, if I don't hear from you, I'm pressing the button.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.070
-好   -那行  我说到做到哦
-Sure.   -Okay. And I will do it!

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:55.980
当然了  我们都相信你  米歇尔
Yeah, we all believe you, Michelle.

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:58.950
她不可能是他女朋友  不可能啊
No way that's his girlfriend. No way.

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:01.990
-她说到做到哦   -绝对的
-She'll do it.   -Absolutely. She will.

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.190
行吧
Okay.

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:05.400
一会儿见
See you later.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.760
-注意安全   -你也是
-Be safe.   -You too.

01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:10.070
哇
Whoa.

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:12.470
好吧
Okay.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.230
-小心点   -好  你也是
-Be careful, okay?   -Yeah. You too.

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.130
所以...
So, uhh...

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.020
谁要一起来
Who's coming with me?

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:32.990
算我一个
Well, I'm in.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.120
但是一旦有什么不对劲...
But, if this goes sideways...

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.650
我就给你电成烤蜘蛛
I'm gonna fry you from the inside out.

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.490
-康纳斯呢   -他跟我说想要留在卡车里
-Where's Connors?   -He told me he wants to stay in the truck.

01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:57.130
-好吧   -警报系统已解除
-Okay.   -Alarm systems, deactivated.

01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:59.590
梅姨
Aunt May.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:03.460
-怎么了   -我觉得用哈皮的房子干这种事不太好
-Yeah.   -I feel kinda bad using Happy's place like this.

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.990
不会的  不会的  他不会在意的
No, no, no, no. He'll get over it.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.330
不好意思
Sorry.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.030
这就是你的计划吗  彼得
So this is your plan, Peter? Mmm?

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.200
实验室和设备你一个也没有  打算在公寓里创造奇迹呢
No lab, no facilities, just performing miracles in a condominium?

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.670
怎么  你打算用微波炉给我们熬制解药  再煎俩玉米饼吗
What, you're gonna cook up some cures, some frozen burritos in a microwave?

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:22.330
玉米饼不错啊  我可以来一个
I could go for a burrito.

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:23.810
他会把我们全害死的
He's gonna kill us all.

01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:25.410
咱们往好处想吧
Well, let's hope not.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.190
你是第一个  博士
You're up first, Doc.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.550
什么  我跟你说了  我不需要治疗
What? Hey, I told you. I don't need fixing.

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:32.620
我不需要
I don't need fixing!

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:36.990
尤其不需要靠青少年  用单身狗的垃圾堆治疗我
Especially by a teenager using scraps from a bachelor's junk drawer.

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:38.520
不不不
No, no, no, no.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.020
他还是有点东西的
He got something back there.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.190
我能感觉到它
I can feel it.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.830
一种奇怪的能量
Weird energy.

01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:44.930
那是什么鬼东西啊
What the hell is that?

01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.800
这是一个生成器
It's a fabricator.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.550
基本上可以分析  设计  构建任何东西
It can analyze, design, construct basically anything.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.890
我还以为那是个日光浴床  被哈皮睡塌了
I thought that was a tanning bed Happy broke.

01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:57.840
瞧瞧
Look at that.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.600
他肯定会把我们都害死
He's gonna kill us all.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.390
博士脖子后面的芯片
So, the chip in the back of Doc's neck

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:22.240
是用来保护他的大脑
was designed to protect his brain from the A.I. system

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.390
不受人工智能系统控制触手的侵害  但你看这里...
that's controlling these tentacles. But if you look here...

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.350
芯片烧了  所以与其说他在控制触手
The chip is fried. So rather than him being in control of the tentacles,

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:32.670
不如说触手控制了他
the tentacles are now in control of him.

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:34.950
我想这解释了为什么...
Which, I guess explains why...

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.590
他总是很痛苦
he is so miserable all the time.

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:47.210
喝水吗
Thirsty?

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.180
嗯  喝点吧  我也渴了
Well, yes. I am thirsty.

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:53.980
白开水还是盐水
Fresh water or salt?

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.880
我想着  你不是叫章鱼吗
You know, because you're an octopus.

01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:59.580
什么
What?

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:02.600
那就白开水吧
Fresh water it is.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.200
瞧瞧这地方
Look at this place.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:07.210
充满了可能性
And all the possibilities.

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:08.830
哪里  这个公寓吗
What? This condo?

01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:11.920
对啊  这个公寓  我喜欢这样的开放式设计  不是
Yeah. yeah, the condo. I love the whole overfloor plan. No!

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.560
当然不是了  老哥  我说的是这个世界
No, man. I'm talking about the world.

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:17.760
我觉得现在的我挺好的
I kinda like who I am here.

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:20.960
如果有了里面那些能量加成
And all that power back there?

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:23.750
我能做的就更多了
I could be so much more.

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.880
你又为什么到这里来
So why did you come here?

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.170
我有个女儿
I have a daughter.

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:28.910
我还想见到她
And I wanna see her.

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:31.110
但在他完成他的科学小研究之前
But he's not gonna send anyone home.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:34.180
谁都回不了家
Till he's finished his little science project back there.

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:37.480
-你相信他吗   -我不相信任何人
-You trust him?   -I don't trust anyone.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.890
话说你怎么变成这样的
How'd you end up like that anyway?

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:44.100
我以前工作的地方
The place where I worked at...

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.390
他们在做电学实验
They were experimenting with electricity

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:48.850
利用活体生物产生的电能  然后...
created by living organisms, and then...

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.750
我掉进了一个全是电鳗的池子
I fell into a vat of electric eels.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.430
真的假的
You're kidding.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.950
-我掉进了一个超级粒子对撞机   -卧槽
-I fell into a supercollider.   -Damn.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:58.890
看来咱摔倒的时候该小心点
Gotta be careful where you fall.

01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:01.050
真了不起
Remarkable.

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:05.210
科技和你都很棒
The technology and you.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.240
等这一切都结束了
When all this is over,

01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:11.650
如果你愿意通勤
if you need a job and you're

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:14.400
来另一个宇宙找个班上...
willing to commute to another universe...

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:23.510
成功了  真的成了
It worked. That totally worked!

01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:25.670
成功了  我做到了  我做好了
I got it. I did it. I did it.

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:27.490
-你能把他送上来吗   -这就来了
-Will you send him up?   -Yup. Here we go.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.380
-冒犯了   -忍一下  博士
-Sorry.   -Hold on, Doc.

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.870
从我来之后就受尽羞辱
All of these humiliations never cease.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:36.090
让你那科学博览会上的玩意离我远点
You! Keep your science fair project away from me!

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:37.580
嘿  会成功的  有点信心
Hey, it will work. Have faith.

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.810
你这个把自己变成怪物的智障还好意思说呢
Says the reckless fool who turned himself into a monster.

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.510
请不要乱动
Please stop. Hold still.

01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:47.210
你敢碰我
Don't you dare.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:55.670
我发誓  等我脱了身  我一定会...
I swear... when I get out of this wicker, I'm gonna...

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.010
博士  
Doc?

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.110
博士  
Doc?

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:10.920
博士  
Doc?

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:13.530
奥克塔维斯博士
Doctor Octavius?

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.550
好安静...
It's so quiet...

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.720
盘旋在我脑海里的
Those voices...

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:28.560
那些声音...
Inside my head...

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:35.070
我几乎都要忘了...
I'd almost forgotten...

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.330
奥托
Otto.

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:39.690
我在
Yes.

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:40.800
诺曼
Norman.

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:47.740
是我
It's me.

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:51.590
谁敢相信啊
Would you look at that.

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:15.410
我很感激你  好孩子  真的
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:16.840
没事  不用客气
Yeah. You're welcome.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.770
我能帮你做点什么
How can I help you?

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.540
我是彼得  请留言
This is Peter. Leave a message.

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:25.990
嗨  彼得  我是哈皮  我看了看我家门口的监控
Yeah, Peter, this is Happy. I accessed my doorbell camera...

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:27.520
那些家伙都是谁啊
Who are those guys, huh?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.640
那是个生化人吗  你带了个有机械触手的生化人来我家
Is that a cyborg, you bring a cyborg with robot legs into my house?

01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:33.690
还有个人身上糊满泥巴  怎么回事啊  速速回电
One of the guys was made of mud? What's going on? Call me back.

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.310
诺曼  你感觉怎么样
How does it feel, Norman?

01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:47.310
你即将成为完整的人了
You're about to become whole again.

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.210
不再有邪恶的黑暗面了
No more darker half.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.180
只有完完整整的你自己
Just you.

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:54.310
只有我
Just me.

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:04.870
好吧  嗯...
Okay. Umm...

01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:07.970
就放在这里  这个东西...
It just goes right here, this one...

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.730
现在应该正在吸收你体内的能量
That should be drawing power now.

01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:13.150
我一会儿就来检查  但是...
I'm gonna come back in a second just to check on it, but...

01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:15.420
看着点指示灯  都变绿的话
Keep an eye on the lights. When they're all green,

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.580
就代表你体内的电全部耗尽了
it means all the electricity in your body's dissipated.

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.000
嗯  不是所有的电啦
Well, not all the electricity.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.900
我是说  当然你的大脑需要电流来正常运作...
I mean, obviously you know you need electricity for your brain to function...

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.210
你的神经系统也是...
Your nervous system is...

01:09:23.610 --> 01:09:26.220
我也不知道为什么要和你解释身体里的电
I'm not really sure why I'm explaining electricity to you.

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:28.860
-我能问你一个问题吗   -当然
-Can I ask you a question?   -Sure.

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.060
这些是你的乐高玩具吗
Are these your legos?

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:33.280
呃  我该走了
I gotta go.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.730
一会就回来
I'll be back.

01:09:39.570 --> 01:09:42.530
-感觉有点不对劲   -怎么了
-Something feels off.   -What do you mean?

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.930
-我不喜欢这样   -别管它了
-I don't like this.   -Leave it alone.

01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:50.350
你们越快解决问题  我们就能越早回家
The sooner you guys get through with this, the sooner we go home.

01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:00.290
-怎么样  他在哪呢   -他在里面
-Well? Where is he?   -He's inside.

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:01.880
那我们怎么在外面
And yet here we are outside.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.860
我不是说了吗  别跟丢了
Did you not hear me say don't lose him?

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.070
我需要蜘蛛侠的清晰影像
I want incriminating footage of Spider-Man.

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:08.030
我已经通知了灾害控制局  他们马上到
I already called Damage Control. They are on their way.

01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:10.650
好戏开场了
And so it begins.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.160
彼得
Peter?

01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:34.880
怎么了
What's wrong?

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:36.960
我不知道
I don't know.

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:38.840
梅姨
May?

01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:45.890
发生什么了  彼得
What is it, Peter?

01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:54.710
怎么了  彼得
What's up, Peter?

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.240
你为什么用那种表情看我
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:23.580
你的蜘蛛第六感  还真是个巧妙的小把戏
That's some neat trick. That sense of yours.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.420
诺曼
Norman?

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.810
诺曼不在呢  亲爱的
Norman's on sabbatical, honey.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.800
什么鬼
The hell?

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.090
是绿魔
Goblin.

01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:36.470
再也没有邪恶的黑暗面  你真以为我会允许这种事发生吗
No more darker half? Did you really think that I'd let that happen?

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.830
只因为你不知道真正的力量能带给你什么
That I'd let you take away my power just because

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:42.890
我就会让你夺走我的能力吗
you're blind to what true power can bring you?

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:45.240
-你根本就不了解我   -是吗
-You don't know me.   -Don't I?

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.870
我看到她是怎么困住你的
I saw how she trapped you.

01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:54.560
为了她所谓神圣的道德使命而战
Fighting her holy moral mission.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.890
我们根本不需要你来拯救
We don't need you to save us.

01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:01.550
我们无需治疗
We don't need to be fixed.

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:06.990
这些不是诅咒
These are not curses.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.690
它们是上天的馈赠
They're gifts.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.460
不要  诺曼
Norman, no.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.290
-闭嘴  哈巴狗   -你不知道你在说什么
-Quiet, lapdog.   -You don't know what you're talking about.

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:19.650
我一直通过诺曼懦弱的双眼观察你
I watched you from deep behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:25.460
你为自己想要的一切苦苦挣扎
Struggling, to have everything you want,

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.290
但这个世界却逼迫你做出选择
while the world tries to make you choose.

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:34.510
然而神无需选择
Gods don't have to choose.

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:37.960
我们只需索取
We take.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.790
梅  快跑
May, run!

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.890
上帝啊  你都干了什么好事
Oh, my God. What have you done?

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.650
我还是更喜欢以前的你
I liked you better before.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.480
上面  他在上面  就是之前桥上那家伙
Up here! He's up there. It's the guy from the bridge.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.560
是我眼花了吗
Did you see that?

01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:12.220
下去吧你
Get off me!

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.980
徒有强大能力...
Strong enough to have it all...

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:29.390
却懦弱得不敢索取
Too weak to take it!

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:05.770
我可算抓到你了
Now I've gotcha.

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.850
我早说过这样做你要承担后果的
I told you there'd be consequences!

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.880
你的弱点  彼得...
Your weakness, Peter...

01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:31.850
就是你的道德感
is morality.

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:34.020
它会扼住你的喉咙
It's choking you.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.690
感觉到了吗
Can you feel it?

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.790
没用的
It didn't work.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.690
诺曼说得对
Norman was right.

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:52.830
是你传给他的  可悲的懦夫
He got it from you. That pathetic sickness!

01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.220
你想治好我...
You tried to fix me...

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:00.800
梅姨  快走...
May, go...

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.550
现在  换我来修理你
Now, I'm gonna fix you.

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.580
梅姨  快跑  求你了...
May, run, please...

01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.920
梅姨
May!

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.790
彼得  彼得  彼得...
Peter, Peter, Peter...

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:25.150
善心总有恶报
No good deed goes unpunished.

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:27.620
不用着急谢我
You can thank me later.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.690
不要
No!

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.840
-梅姨   -彼得...
-May?   -Peter...

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.230
梅姨  梅姨...我在这呢
May, May... I'm here.

01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:13.900
我在这
I'm here.

01:17:14.610 --> 01:17:16.850
-你还好吗   -嗯嗯  嗯嗯
-Are you okay?   -Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:21.210
真没事吗
Really?

01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:23.250
是啊
Yeah.

01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:25.690
-没事的  我们没事了对吗   -没事了
-It's okay. We're okay, right?   -Yeah.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.260
我磕到了头
Knocked off my head.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.730
-我也是   -其他没事
-Yeah, me too.   -That's all.

01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:32.440
我觉得我肋骨折了
I think I broke my ribs.

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.120
都怪我啊  梅
This is all my fault, May.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.870
-不是的   -我应该听斯特兰奇的
-No.   -I should've just listened to Strange

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:43.720
-让他把他们送回去   -你做得对
-and let him send them back...   -You did the right thing.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.420
不然他们会死掉的
They would have been killed.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.920
你做得对
You did the right thing.

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:49.600
那份责任不属于我  梅姨
It's not my responsibility, May.

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.890
诺曼怎么说的来着
What Norman said?

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.880
我的道德使命
My moral mission.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.860
-不  彼得  听着  你听我说   -不  梅姨 你别...
-No, Peter. Listen. You listen to me.   -No, May, you don't have...

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.830
你拥有这份能力
You have a gift.

01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:05.420
你拥有力量
You have power.

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:11.260
能力越大  责任越大
And with great power, there must also come great responsibility.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.250
是啊  我明白
Yeah. I know.

01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:19.430
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:21.080
好  我们走
Okay, let's go.

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:41.520
-怎么了  你还好吗   -嗯  没事
-What happened? Are you okay?  -Yeah okay.

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.880
没事就好  这是怎么了
Yeah, you're okay. What happened?

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:48.520
就等一会儿...我喘口气
Just one second... to catch my breath...

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.610
好啊  你喘口气  我就在这呢
Okay. Well, catch your breath. I'm right here.

01:18:50.610 --> 01:18:53.100
我们慢慢来  你喘口气  然后...
We're gonna take our time, you catch your breath, and...

01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:54.760
然后我们送你去医院  好吗
and we'll take you to a Doctor, okay?

01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:14.580
你还好吗
Are you okay?

01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:16.930
有人来帮帮忙吗  这里要叫救护车
Somebody help. I need an ambulance.

01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:18.600
救命  有没有人...
Please, somebody...

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.450
怎么了
What happened?

01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:22.890
没事  你没事的  你没事的
Nothing. You're okay. You're okay.

01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:27.380
我就是...喘口气
I'll just... catch my breath...

01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:29.560
好  我就在这里  我就在这里
Okay. I'm right here. I'm right here.

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.230
我就在这里
I'm right here.

01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:39.180
我们不会有事的
We're okay.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.810
就我和你
Just me and you.

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:52.740
梅姨
May?

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.150
梅姨
May?

01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:08.310
你能看看我吗  梅姨  求你了
Will you look at me, May? Please?

01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:19.700
梅姨  梅姨
May? May?

01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:22.910
你在干什么呢  梅姨  求你了
What are you doing, May? Please,

01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:25.390
你能不能起来和我说句话  求求你
will you just wake up and talk to me, please?

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:49.960
下车  快点
Get out of the car now! Move!

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.140
过来  过来  过来
Get down.  Get down. Get down.

01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:02.380
彼得  快跑啊
Peter! Run!

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:04.740
你没事的  就我和你
You are okay. It's just me and you.

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.460
对不起  真的对不起
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:12.590
好了  帕克  举起手  走出来
Alright, Parker. Come out with your hands up.

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:16.430
立刻出来  不然我们开火了
Come out right now. Or we will open fire.

01:21:16.570 --> 01:21:17.790
快跑
Run!

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.490
一场悲剧
Tragedy.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.760
不然我还能怎么形容呢
What else can I call it?

01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.560
还需要多言什么
What more need be said?

01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:53.000
断壁残垣...
The damage...

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.790
满目疮痍...
The destruction...

01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:57.290
大家都亲眼目睹
You saw it with your own eyes.

01:21:58.350 --> 01:22:00.820
人们何时才能醒悟
When will people wake up, and realize

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.160
蜘蛛侠所到之处
that everywhere Spider-Man goes...

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.000
混乱与灾难接踵而至
Chaos and calamity ensue.

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:11.490
蜘蛛侠所及之物皆会毁灭
Everything Spider-Man touches comes to ruin.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.810
而我们这些无辜民众
And we, the innocents,

01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:17.490
要留下来收拾残局
are left to pick up the pieces.

01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:21.620
J·乔纳·詹姆斯为您报道
J. Jonah Jameson, reporting.

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:22.660
晚安
Good night.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.230
愿上帝保佑我们
And God help us all.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.520
还是没消息吗
Still nothing?

01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:55.890
没
No.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.270
我要按了
I'm gonna press it.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.860
-什么  不行   -彼得让我等他  但...
-What? No!   -Peter told me to wait, but...

01:23:18.970 --> 01:23:19.760
我要按了
I'm gonna do it.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.740
我只希望...我只希望我们能见到他
I just wish... I just wish that we could see him.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.640
-内德   -什么
-Ned?   -Yeah?

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:32.160
-再来一次   -好
-Do that again.   -Yeah.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.150
我只希望我们能见到他
I just wish we could see him.

01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:40.560
好吧...
Okay...

01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:43.050
我只希望我们能见到彼得
I just wish we could see Peter.

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.590
魔法师
Salamangkero!

01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:52.070
您说的没错  我会魔法
You're right. I am magic.

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:54.240
是他吗
Is that him?

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.680
-那当然了  不是他还能是谁   -彼得
-Yeah, yeah. It has to be.   -Peter.

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.920
-彼得  彼得   -嘿  彼得
-Peter. Peter!   -Hey, Peter!

01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.060
彼得
Peter!

01:24:07.230 --> 01:24:09.280
嗨  嗨
Hi. Hi!

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.610
不  不  别紧张  我可是好人
No, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. I'm nice guy.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.030
好吧
Okay...

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.050
你特么是谁啊
Who the hell are you?

01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:21.610
我是彼得·帕克
I'm Peter Parker.

01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:22.610
别逗了行吗
That's not possible.

01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:24.780
我是蜘蛛侠
I am Spider-Man.

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:27.370
在我的那个世界里  但是  好像是昨天
In my world. But then, yesterday?

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.530
我就...
I was...

01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:33.300
我就直接来到了这个世界
I was just here.

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.090
不可思议
Wow.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.250
弦理论...
String theory...

01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:40.760
多重现实...
Multidimensional reality...

01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:43.620
还有物质位移
And matter displacement.

01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:44.970
都是真的吗
All real?

01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:46.110
对啊...
Yeah...

01:24:46.110 --> 01:24:48.140
我就知道
Knew it!

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.760
应该是我的咒语出了问题
This has to be because of the spell.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.130
咒语
The spell?

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.990
-是那种魔法咒语吗   -不是咒语你听错了
-Like magic spell?   -There's no spell.

01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.780
-没这回事   -没有
-No spell.   -No.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.160
魔法在这里也真实存在吗
Magic's real here, too?

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.220
-就是说...   -闭嘴  内德
-I mean...   -Shut up, Ned.

01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:58.990
-不是真实存在的啦  -快闭嘴
-No, it's not real.   -Shut up.

01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:01.840
我是说...这里是有魔术师之类的东西啦  但可没有...
I mean... There's magicians and stuff, but there's no like...

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.340
闭嘴行吗  闭嘴
Stop it. Stop.

01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:05.940
-证明一下   -证明啥
-Prove it.   -Prove what?

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:06.920
证明你是彼得·帕克
That you're Peter Parker.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:09.050
我一般不随身携带身份证的  懂我意思吗
I don't carry an ID with me, you know?

01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:12.150
有点不符合匿名超英的作风
Kinda defeats the whole anonymous superhero thing?

01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:16.630
-你干嘛呢   -我看看你有没有那个一激灵
-Why'd you do that?   -To see if you have the tingle thing.

01:25:16.630 --> 01:25:18.750
我有倒是有  只不过对面包不起效
I have the tingle thing, just not from bread.

01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:20.740
你能别朝我扔面包了吗
Can you not throw the bread again?

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:23.320
你很难信任别人
You're a deeply mistrusting person.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.200
我理解
And I respect that.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.460
爬一圈
Crawl around.

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.280
-爬一圈吗   -没错
-Crawl around?   -Yes.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.710
-我不   -你必须爬
-No.   -Yes. Crawl around.

01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:37.730
-我到底为什么要爬一圈啊   -因为你现在这样还不够证明
-Why do I need to crawl around?   -Cause it's not enough.

01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:39.000
-已经够了   -根本不够
-This is plenty.   -No, it's not.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.740
-我这样已经够意思了   -我说不够  还不够
-Yes, it is.   -No, it's not. Nuh-uh.

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.380
我就问你我是靠什么黏住天花板的
How do I stick to the ceiling?

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.150
快点
Do it.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.880
内德...
Ned...

01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:47.990
帮我跟那个人说
sabihin mo diyan sa mamang yan,

01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:51.800
能不能把那边的蛛网弄掉
na alisin yung agiw sa sulok. Ha?

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.700
我奶奶问你能不能把那边的蜘蛛网清理一下
My Lola's asking if you could just get the cobweb there.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.240
-太高了...  我们够不到   -好
-It's too, like, up there?   -Yeah.

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:06.350
感谢你
Thank you.

01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:12.210
可以了吧
We're good?

01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:13.200
相信我了吧
We're good.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.440
暂时吧
For now.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:17.780
我开错了传送门  然后带来了错误的彼得·帕克
So, I opened a wrong portal to the wrong Peter Parker.

01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:20.580
确实  你就继续试吧  直到找到真的那个
Yeah, I guess you just keep doing it until you find the real one.

01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:22.430
-扎心了   -无意冒犯
-Ouch.   -No offense.

01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:24.660
-好吧   -没事  你可以的
-Okay.   -Okay. You got it.

01:26:26.730 --> 01:26:28.250
找到彼得·帕克
Find Peter Parker.

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:30.100
他手上这东西是什么
What's this thing on his hand?

01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:32.660
找到彼得·帕克
Find Peter Parker.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.080
找到彼得·帕克
Find Peter Parker!

01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:47.220
好家伙  找到了个路人甲
Great, it's just some random guy.

01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:48.330
你们好啊
Hello.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.170
应该没什么事吧  我直接穿过了这个...
I hope it's okay, I just came through this...

01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:54.700
它又关上了
It just closed.

01:26:55.930 --> 01:26:57.100
你是彼得吗
You're Peter?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.560
对  彼得·帕克
Yeah. Peter Parker.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.330
诶...我好像看到过你们俩...
I... I've seen you two...

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:07.400
你好啊
Hi.

01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:14.450
等等  他...他好像不是你们那个朋友啊
Wait. He's... He's not your friend...

01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:31.990
就是说  你也是蜘蛛侠咯
Whoa, it's... So you're Spider-Man too?

01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:33.230
你怎么不直接告诉我们呢
Why didn't you just say that?

01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:35.960
我还真不会大张旗鼓地宣传这个
I generally don't go around advertising it.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.600
有点不符合匿名超英的作风
Kinda defeats the whole anonymous superhero thing.

01:27:38.610 --> 01:27:39.680
-和我刚才说的一样   -和他刚才说的一样
-I just said that...   -That's what he just said.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.600
你啊  赶紧动起来
Ikaw, ha? Nagkalat ka nanaman.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.050
把你造出来的垃圾都打扫干净
Linisin mo lahat ng mga basura mo dito.

01:27:46.050 --> 01:27:49.660
还有你  我很想让我们的屋子干干净净的
At ikaw? Alam mo na gusto ko itong bahay natin, maayos.

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:52.520
但是你看这也脏了  那也脏了
pero tingnan mo, dumi dito, dumi doon.

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.680
我奶奶想问  你们能不能把你们刚刚弄的蛛网清理干净
My Lola's asking if you could clean up the webs that you just shot.

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.720
-哦  抱歉  奶奶  -我们会清理掉的
-Oh. Sorry, Lola.   -Yes, of course.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.140
我睡觉去了
I'm going to bed.

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.310
-晚安  奶奶   -晚安  内德奶奶
-Night, Lola.   -Good night, Ned's Lola.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.640
说起来可能有点奇怪  但是...
This might seem kind of weird, but...

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.310
自从我来到这里之后  我就一直在找你们的朋友
I've been trying to find your friend ever since I got here.

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.270
我有一种感觉...
I just had this sense that...

01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:14.510
他需要我的帮助
That he needs my help.

01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:15.610
我们的帮助
Our help.

01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:18.880
他确实需要
He does.

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.340
-可是我们不知道他在哪   -而且  嗯...
-We don't know where he is.   -And, umm...

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:24.800
说实话  他现在只有我们了
Honestly, right now, we're all he really has left.

01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:28.950
这样吧  有没有这样一些地方
Well, is there some place,

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:33.840
对他来说意义非凡  他可能会去的
that he might go that has meaning to him?

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:36.090
像那种...
Like a...

01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:38.010
他在那里可以直接...
a place where he would go to just...

01:28:38.010 --> 01:28:40.150
逃离一切吗
Get away from everything?

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:46.100
是我的话  我会去克莱斯勒大厦楼顶
For me, it was the top of the Chrysler Building.

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.640
我去的是帝国大厦
Empire State.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.220
视野更好
Better view.

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.820
那儿确实风景好
That is a sweet view.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.460
有的
Yes.

01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:59.150
对的  我想我知道他会去哪
Yeah, I think I know exactly where that would be.

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.360
对不起
I'm sorry.

01:29:42.970 --> 01:29:47.680
彼得  有...还有别人来了
Peter,there's some... there's some people here...

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:49.920
什么  是谁
What? Who?

01:29:58.750 --> 01:30:00.440
嘿  等下  等下
Hey. Wait, wait, whoa.

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:06.360
我很抱歉...
Sorry...

01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:09.480
梅姨的事
About May.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.160
节哀
Yeah. Sorry.

01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:19.010
-我差不多理解你正在经历什么...   -不不不
-I got some understanding of what you're going through...   -No no no.

01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:21.350
别说的你很了解我一样
Please don't tell me that you know what I'm going through.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:22.980
好
Okay.

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:24.670
她死了
She's gone.

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:28.930
都怪我
It's all my fault.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.300
让她白白送命
She died for nothing.

01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.220
所以我一开始就该这么做
So I'm gonna do what I should've done in the first place.

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:41.750
-彼得...   -不用说了
-Peter...   -Please, don't.

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:47.070
你们俩都不属于这里  所以我要送你们回家了
You don't belong here. Either of you, so I'm sending you home.

01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:50.610
那些家伙都是来自你们的世界  对吧
Those other guys are from your worlds, right?

01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:52.310
那就留给你们处置吧
So you deal with it.

01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:54.860
如果他们死了  或是你们杀了他们...
If they die, if you kill them...

01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:57.010
那都是算在你们头上的
That's on you.

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.900
不关我事
It's not my problem.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:00.700
我什么都不在乎了
I don't care anymore.

01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:03.130
我受够了
I'm done.

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.430
很抱歉把你们都卷了进来
I'm really sorry that I dragged you into this.

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.620
但你们现在得回去了
But you have to go home now.

01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:19.160
祝你们好运
Good luck.

01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:26.930
我的本叔叔被杀了
My Uncle Ben was killed.

01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:29.400
是我的错
It was my fault.

01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:32.090
我失去了...
I lost...

01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:36.690
我失去了格温  她是我的...
I lost Gwen. My...

01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:39.680
她就是我的MJ
She was my MJ.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.460
我没能救下她
I couldn't save her.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.640
我永远都不会原谅我自己
I'm never gonna be able to forgive myself for that.

01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:52.650
但我坚持了下去  试着...
But I carried on. Tried to...

01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:56.480
试着继续  继续去做那个...
Tried to keep going. Tried to keep being the...

01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:59.310
...大家的友好邻居蜘蛛侠  因为
... friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, because

01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:01.880
我知道她也希望我这么做  但是...
I know that's what she would have wanted. But...

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.880
有些时候  我就...
At some point, I just...

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.190
下手毫不留情
I stopped pulling my punches.

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:11.080
我变得愤恨
I got rageful.

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.380
充满怒火
I got bitter.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.610
我只是不想让你也变得...和我一样
I just don't want you, to end up like... Like me.

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:24.610
本叔叔去世的那晚
The night Ben died,

01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:28.100
我抓到了我以为的凶手
I hunted down the man who I thought did it.

01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:31.230
我恨不得杀了他
I wanted him dead.

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.680
虽然我得偿所愿了
I got what I wanted.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.570
但我并没觉得更好受
It didn't make it better.

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.730
我花了很久一段时间...
It took me a long time to...

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.840
学习如何熬过这些黑暗的日子
learn to get through that darkness.

01:32:52.230 --> 01:32:53.790
我就是想杀了他
I wanna kill him.

01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:58.240
把他四分五裂
I wanna tear him apart.

01:33:01.810 --> 01:33:04.160
梅姨的声音还回荡在我的脑海中
I can still hear her voice in my head.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:13.700
尽管她身受重伤  她还告诉我  我们做得对
Even after she was hurt, she said to me that we did the right thing.

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:24.870
她跟我说  能力越大...
She told me that with great power...

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:28.430
责任越大
comes great responsibility.

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:35.160
等下  你怎么知道这句话
Wait, what? How do you know that?

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.790
本叔叔告诉我的
Uncle Ben said it.

01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:38.300
就在他去世的那天
The day he died.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.250
也许她并没有白白送命  彼得
Maybe she didn't die for nothing, Peter.

01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:56.500
好吧  那么...
Okay, so...

01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:00.030
康纳斯  马尔科  狄龙  还有...
Connors, Marko, Dillon, and...

01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:05.430
听着  我大概能修好狄龙和马尔科的装置  但其他人的...
Look, I think that I can repair the devices for Dillon and Marko, but the others...

01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:09.070
我能搞定康纳斯的  毕竟我已经治好他一次了  小事一桩
Well, I got Connors. I've already cured him once, so no big deal.

01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:11.630
咋了  就是小事一桩啊
What? It's no big deal.

01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:12.620
赞
Great.

01:34:13.190 --> 01:34:14.520
是啊  赞
Yeah. That's great.

01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:20.810
我觉得我能给奥斯本博士做一份抗血清
I think I can make an antiserum for Doctor Osborn.

01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:23.100
我已经想了很久了
Been thinking about it a long time.

01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:27.620
我们得把他们全治好
Gotta cure all of them.

01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:28.830
好吗
Right?

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.130
好
Right.

01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:34.270
我们就是干这个的
That's what we do.

01:34:42.330 --> 01:34:43.030
咋了
What?

01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:45.830
这有三个你
It's three yous.

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:04.550
所以说...
So...

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.130
你也有好基友吗
Do you have a best friend too?

01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:10.040
曾经有过
I did.

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.380
什么叫曾经有过
You did?

01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:16.770
他想杀了我来着
He died in my arms.

01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:20.160
然后死在了我怀里
After he tried to kill me.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.590
真是心碎呢
It was heartbreaking.

01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:26.780
我滴天
Dude.

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.130
你能...帮我跑个检测吗
Will you...run a diagnostic?

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.110
好的
Okay.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.810
嘿  你还好吗
Hey, you okay?

01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:50.990
嗯还好  你呢
Yeah, I'm fine. You okay?

01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:56.640
你不该承受这些的
You don't deserve this.

01:35:57.630 --> 01:36:01.180
-我毁了你的人生...   -嘿别这么说
-I ruined your life...   -Hey. No, no, no, no, no.

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.800
看着我  我就在这儿呢
Look at me. I'm here.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.580
我哪儿都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:11.050
我们会挺过去的  我们会一起度过难关的
We're gonna get through this. We're gonna get through it together.

01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:13.310
好吗
Okay?

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.580
好的
Okay.

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.420
你现在有另一半吗
You have someone?

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:37.060
没有
No.

01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:43.100
我没时间过彼得·帕克自己的生活...你懂吧
I got no time for Peter Parker stuff... You know?

01:36:45.010 --> 01:36:46.350
你有吗
Do you?

01:36:47.130 --> 01:36:49.850
呃  我的情况有点...复杂
It's a little... complicated.

01:36:50.150 --> 01:36:51.300
我知道  我懂
I understand.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.810
我猜像我们这样的人都是情路坎坷的
I guess it's just not in the cards for guys like us.

01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:54.820
嗯...
Well...

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.050
可我没有放弃
I wouldn't give up.

01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:58.270
花了一段时间  但是...
Took a while, but...

01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:00.720
-我们想出了办法   -是吗
-We made it work.   -Yeah?

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.710
是啊  我和...
Yeah. Me and...

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:03.930
MJ
MJ.

01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:07.500
我的MJ  她...
My MJ. She, uhh...

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.630
在这里容易混淆啊  是吧
It gets confusing, huh?

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:13.470
彼得
Peter?

01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:17.180
在  不好意思  你是叫...那位  还是...
Yeah? Oh, sorry. You mean...that or...?

01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:18.020

01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:20.590
彼得·帕克
Peter Parker?

01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:22.980
-还是一样   -我们都是彼得·帕克
-Same again.   -We're all Peter Parker.

01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.780
-电脑   -哦
-The computer!   -Oh.

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.400
-哦  我的准备好了   -我也是
-Oh, I'm ready.   -Yeah, me too.

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:32.470
好的  现在我们只需要把这些家伙引到一个地方  对吧
Okay, so... Now, all we gotta do is lure these guys someplace, right?

01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:37.520
在他们试图杀我们的时候  治好他们  然后送他们回家
Try to cure them, while they try to kill us, and then, send them home.

01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:39.170
用一个魔法盒子
Using a magic box?

01:37:39.170 --> 01:37:40.220
是的  计划就是这样
Well, that's the plan.

01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:43.100
那么你是要打扮成一个酷酷的青年牧师去参战呢
So are you gonna go into battle dressed as a cool, youth pastor,

01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.060
还是你也有战衣
or do you got your suit?

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.400
好极了
Good.

01:37:47.650 --> 01:37:48.780
这是你的蛛丝盒
Here's your web cartridges.

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:49.900
哦  谢了内德
Oh, thanks, Ned.

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:51.550
这玩意是干啥的
What's that for?

01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:54.280
是我的蛛丝液  放在我的蛛丝发射器里  怎么了
It's my web fluid. It's for my web shooters. Why?

01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:59.630
-你直接从体内射出蛛丝吗   -是啊
-That came out of you?   -Yeah.

01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:01.410
-你不行吗   -不行啊
-You can't do that, huh?   -No.

01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:02.960
你到底是怎么做到...
How on Earth is that...

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.410
总之  我们跑题了  看
Anyway, we're getting sidetracked. Look,

01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:06.410
我们在这个地方动手  这里被围起来了
this is where we're gonna do this, okay? It's isolated,

01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:08.540
所以不会伤及别人
so no one should get hurt.

01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:11.030
我们用盒子把他们引过去  他们都想要那盒子
We draw them there with the box, it's the one thing they all want.

01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:13.170
我们只要想好怎么过去
All we have to do is figure out how we're gonna get there.

01:38:13.170 --> 01:38:14.330
哦  我们可以开传送门过去
Oh, we can portal there.

01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:15.510
-什么   -我现在会魔法的
-What?   -I magic now.

01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:17.270
是  是真的  他确实会
Yeah, no, no. He's right. He can. He can.

01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:18.930
-是的  我们看见了   -确实
-Yeah, we saw him.   -Yeah. He is.

01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:21.690
-等等  认真的吗   -哥们  我现在会奇异博士的魔法了
-Wait, really?   -Dude, I got Doctor Strange magic.

01:38:21.690 --> 01:38:22.890
-真的假的   -没错是真的
-What?   -Yeah!

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.310
还有  我向你保证...
And I promise you...

01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:26.950
我不会变成大反派来杀你的
I won't turn into a supervillain and try to kill you.

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.310
好吧...
Okay...

01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:32.450
非常感谢
Thank you.

01:38:37.130 --> 01:38:38.050
嗯...
Umm...

01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:41.320
好了  别管那么多了  你常说的那句话是什么
Alright. Here goes nothing. What's that thing you always say?

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:44.200
-如果你做好会失望的准备...   -不  不
-If you expect disappointment...   -No, no, no...

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.020
我们去揍他们个落花流水
We gotta kick some ass.

01:38:47.410 --> 01:38:48.080
好的
Okay.

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:49.800
是治
Cure.

01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:51.740
好好治治他们
Cure some ass.

01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:53.180
治他丫的
Cure that ass.

01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:56.990
女士们  先生们...
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:38:56.990 --> 01:39:02.350
号角热线接到了电话  正是逃犯蜘蛛侠打来的
The Bugle tip line has just received a call from none other than the fugitive known as Spider-Man.

01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:05.380
他刚在皇后区大闹了一场
Fresh from his rampage in Queens.

01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:09.840
彼得·帕克  你又打算宣扬什么有害的想法
So, Peter Parker... What pernicious propaganda are you peddling?

01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.870
-只想说真相而已   -哦  当然
-Just the truth.   -Oh, sure.

01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:13.200
真相就是...
Truth is...

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:16.180
这全都是我的错
That this is all my fault.

01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:18.980
我不小心把那几个危险的坏人带到了这里
I accidentally brought those dangerous people here.

01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.720
嗯  他居然承认了
Well, he admits it!

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.830
如果那几个人在看节目的话...
And if those people are watching...

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.860
我做的一切都是为了帮你们
Just know that I really did try to help you.

01:39:27.710 --> 01:39:29.310
我本可以杀了你们
I could've killed you.

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:33.030
随时都可以  但我没有
At any given moment, but I didn't.

01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:38.110
因为我的梅姨教导我  每个人都应该有个改过自新的机会
Because my Aunt May taught me that everyone deserves a second chance.

01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:39.240
因此我在这里
And that's why I'm here.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.470
这里是指哪里  说具体点
And where is here, exactly?

01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:45.410
最能代表改过自新机会的地方
A place that represents second chances.

01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:50.480
自由女神像吗  我的天呐  家人们
The Statue of Liberty? Good God, folks!

01:39:50.710 --> 01:39:53.980
他要摧毁另一个国家地标建筑了
He's about to destroy another national landmark.

01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:55.750
全世界的观众朋友们  如果你们在看...
The world, if you're watching...

01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:57.670
相信我  大家肯定都在看
Believe me, the world is watching.

01:39:58.630 --> 01:39:59.810
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:04.220
你们的友好邻居蜘蛛侠真的需要些好运
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man could really use some.

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.410
好嘞  兄弟们  他们随时会来
Okay, guys. It could be any minute now.

01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:14.690
好的  快完事了
Yup. Almost done.

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:24.800
你们知道吗  麦克斯是我见过的最贴心的人
You know, Max was like,the sweetest guy ever.

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.710
直到他掉进了...
Before he fell into a...

01:40:27.170 --> 01:40:28.930
一个养电鳗的池子
pool of electric eels.

01:40:28.930 --> 01:40:30.430
怪不得啊
That'll do it.

01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:34.340
又来了...
There it goes...

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.080
-你还好吗   -哦
-You okay?   -Oops

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.280
我的背
My back.

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.370
我估计可能是荡来荡去太多了  有点僵
It's kind of stiff from all the swinging, I guess.

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:44.330
哦对没错  我腰中间也疼
Oh, yeah, no, I got a middle back pain, too.

01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:45.800
-真的吗   -真的
-Really?   -Yeah.

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.240
想让我帮你拉伸下吗
You want me to crack it?

01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:49.240
好啊
Yeah.

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:50.980
那太棒了
That would be great.

01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:53.730
-你准备好了吗   -好了
-You ready?   -Yeah.

01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:58.850
太带劲儿了
That's good.

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.410
感觉怎么样
How is it?

01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:01.390
爽啊
Wow.

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:03.850
-挺不错的   -对吧
-That's good.   -Right?

01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:05.340
-感觉好多了   -那就行
-That's better.   -Yeah.

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.330
太爽了
Wow.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.070
我天  这太酷了
God, this is so cool.

01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:13.130
我一直都想有几个兄弟的
I always wanted brothers.

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:17.120
所以你自身能够制造蛛丝吗
So you could like make your own web fluid in your body?

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:19.100
咱们还是别聊这个话题了
I'd rather not talk about this.

01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:20.010
不  我并不是想...
No, I don't mean to...

01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:21.670
-你在嘲讽我吗   -不不不  当然不是了
-Are you teasing me?   -No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:23.900
他没有嘲讽你  只是...
He's not teasing you. It's just that...

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:27.850
我们都做不到  所以自然好奇你的蛛丝是什么情况
We can't do that, so naturally we're curious as to how your web situation works.

01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:30.330
-就是这样   -如果涉及到你的个人隐私  那我就不多问了
-That's all.   -If it's personal, I don't wanna...like pry.

01:41:30.330 --> 01:41:31.410
-我只是觉得你这样很酷   -不
-I just think it's cool.   -No.

01:41:31.410 --> 01:41:35.470
我也想告诉你们  但我没办法解释  这就好比...
I wish I could tell you, but it's like, I don't do it... Like I don't...

01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:38.720
-好比我不刻意呼吸  呼吸自然发生   -哇哦
-Like, I don't do breathing. Like, breathing just happens.   -Whoa.

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.240
所以只有你的手腕能射出蛛丝  还是...
Like, does it just come out of your wrists, or...

01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:43.500
其他地方也能射出来
Does it come out off anywhere else?

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.200
只有... 只有手腕啦
Only... only the wrists.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.790
你从来没有射不出蛛丝的时候吗  我的蛛丝总是不够用
You never had to web block? Cause I run out of webs all the time.

01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:49.970
我不得不自己搞了个实验室做蛛丝
I had to make my own lab.

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.670
可麻烦了呢
And it's a hassle.

01:41:51.670 --> 01:41:53.360
是啊  听起来确实很麻烦
That sounds like a hassle. Yeah.

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.040
但你这么一说  我也有过这种情况  我那个时候...
But I did, actually, as you said that. I was like...

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:58.230
-也射不出蛛丝   -为什么啊
-I had a web block.   -Why?

01:41:58.290 --> 01:42:00.080
怀疑自我价值之类的事儿
Existential crisis stuff.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.860
-哎  快别提了   -嘿...
-Yeah, don't get me started on that.   -Hey...

01:42:02.970 --> 01:42:05.890
你们有打过什么超疯狂的反派吗
What are like, some of the craziest villains that you guys have fought?

01:42:05.890 --> 01:42:08.240
看来你已经见过几位了
Seems you've met some of them.

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:10.700
-这问题问得好   -我之前打过一个...
-That's a good question.   -I fought a...

01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:12.190
一个外星人...
an alien...

01:42:12.190 --> 01:42:15.240
-由黑色粘液构成的外星人   -巧了啊
-made out of black goo once.   -No way!

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.610
我也和外星人打过
I fought an alien, too.

01:42:16.610 --> 01:42:18.150
-在地球上和外太空都打过   -哇
-On Earth and in space.   -Oh

01:42:18.150 --> 01:42:20.130
-是的  他还是紫色的呢   -我也想打一打外星人
-Yeah. He was purple.   -I wanna fight an alien.

01:42:20.130 --> 01:42:21.740
我还是很惊讶...
I'm, I'm still, like...

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:24.870
你竟然在太空里打过外星人
That you fought an alien, in Space.

01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:27.880
和你们一比我好菜  我只打过一个俄罗斯人...
I'm lame compare to... like, I fought a Russian guy in a...

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.530
他操纵着一个犀牛形机器
Like a rhinoceros machine.

01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:31.970
等等  咱们倒回到之前你说你好菜
Hey, can we rewind it back to the "I'm lame" part?

01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:33.620
-因为你一点都不菜   -谢谢
-'Cause, you are not.   -Aw, thanks.

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:35.530
不  好吧  谢了  我不是说我菜
No, yeah. I appreciate it, I'm not saying I'm lame.

01:42:35.530 --> 01:42:37.420
但这是一种自我暗示  或许我们应该...
But it's just the self-talk maybe we should, you know...

01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:38.880
是的  听着...
Yeah, listen...

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.720
你...你很超凡
You're... You're Amazing.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.270
你好好想一想
Just to take it in for a minute.

01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:44.900
-行行行  我想下   -你...很超凡
-Yeah, yeah, yeah I can take it.  I can take it.  -You... You are amazing.

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.280
-我知道啦   -你最棒啦
-I can take that.   -You are amazing.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.580
-谢谢你   -你能自己说出来嘛
-Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.   -Will you say it?

01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.760
不了  我听到有人这么跟我说就行了  谢谢
No, I kinda needed to hear that. Thank you.

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.950
好了  各位  集中精神
Alright guys, focus up.

01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:53.620
-你们感觉到了吗   -感觉到了
-Can you feel that?   -Yeah.

01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.360
你好啊  彼得
What's up, Peter?

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.800
你觉得我的新造型咋样
How do you like the new new?

01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:12.230
听着  把东西给我  我要毁了它
Look, you give it to me, I'm gonna destroy it.

01:43:13.050 --> 01:43:14.900
但我会给你留个活口
But I'll let you live.

01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:17.350
别逼我杀人  彼得
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:21.220

Okay, guys. Here it comes.

01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:29.120

接住了  快把门关上
Got it! Close it.

01:43:41.250 --> 01:43:43.360
-内德  没关上啊   -嗯  我知道
-Ned, it's not closing   -Yeah, I know.

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:44.420
为啥关不上啊
Why isn't it closing?

01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:46.400
-我也不知道...我...   -你之前关上过吗
-I don't know... I...   -Did you close before. Did you...

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.050
-没有吗   -没有啊  我只开过几个
-No?   -No. I mean I have opened some.

01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:00.490
麦克斯  麦克斯  我们能谈谈吗  就咱们俩人  就...
Max, Max, Max. Can we just talk for a second? Just you and me, just...

看看是谁来了  是我的老朋友蜘蛛侠啊
Look who showed up! My old friend Spider-Man.

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:05.680
我是在救你  麦克斯  我只想救你
I'm trying to save you, Max. That's all I've ever wanted.

01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:07.590
-你才不是想救我呢   -我认真的
-You're not trying to save me.   -I am.

02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:44.630
发生什么了
What's happening?

02:00:44.630 --> 02:00:46.710
他们快要过来了  我阻止不了他们了
They're starting to come through and I can't stop them.

02:00:46.710 --> 02:00:49.990
一定会有办法的  你就不能再施个咒语吗
There's got to be something we can do. Can't you just cast a spell again?

02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:53.660
-像我搞砸之前的那样   -太迟了  他们已经到了
-Like the original way. Before I screwed it up.   -We're too late for that. They're here.

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:57.070
他们是因你而来的
They're here because of you.

02:01:02.130 --> 02:01:04.830
-如果大家都忘了我的身份呢  -什么
-What if everyone forgot who I was?   -What?

02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.670
他们是因我而来的  是吧
They're coming here because of me, right?

02:01:06.670 --> 02:01:08.510
就因为我是彼得·帕克是吧
Because I'm Peter Parker?

02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:10.020
那施个新的咒语吧  
So cast a new spell.

02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:12.140
但这次  让所有人都忘记彼得·帕克是谁吧
But this time, make everyone forget who Peter Parker is.

02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:14.080
让所有人都忘记...
Make everyone forget...

02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:16.400
我
Me.

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.350
不
No.

02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:18.580
但这行得通  是吧
But it would work, right?

02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:20.110
是  是行得通
Yeah, it would work.

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:25.770
但你要明白  那意味着所有认识你  爱着你的人
But you got to understand, that would mean everyone, who knows and loves you

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.310
我们都会...
We'd...

02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:31.000
失去所有关于你的记忆
We'd have no memory of you.

02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.700
就像你从未存在过一样
It'll be as though you never existed.

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.900
我知道
I know.

02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:42.330
施咒吧
Do it.

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:48.690
那快去道别吧  你没剩多少时间了
Man, better go and say your goodbyes. You don't have long.

02:01:48.690 --> 02:01:49.840
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:51.870
叫我史蒂芬
Call me Stephen.

02:01:54.510 --> 02:01:55.680
谢谢你  史蒂芬
Thank you, Stephen.

02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:58.170
对...
Yeah...

02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:00.500
感觉还是怪怪的
Still feels weird.

02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:04.360
回头见
I'll see you around.

02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:07.540
再见了  孩子
So long, kid.

02:02:15.850 --> 02:02:19.420
我觉得是时候了  你们该回家了
I think this is it. I think you're about to go home.

02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:22.270
-好的   -但我...呃...
-Ok. Alright.   -But I... uhh...

02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:26.110
谢谢你们
Thank you.

02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:27.920
我只是想...
I just wanted...

02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:30.190
我想...我想告诉你们
I want you...I wanna tell you that...

02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:32.400
我真的不知道该怎么说
I really don't know how to say this, like...

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.440
-彼得   -我想让你们知道我...
-Peter.   -I want you to know that I...

02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:36.890
你懂的
You know.

02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:38.980
这就是我们的责任
It's what we do.

02:02:40.170 --> 02:02:41.730
对  是我们的责任
Yeah. It's what we do.

02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:45.490
好了  我得去找内德跟MJ了
Right. I gotta find Ned and MJ.

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:49.450
谢谢  谢谢  谢谢  真的谢谢你们
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:55.000
我猜我们会再见的
I guess I'll see you.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.740
-再见   -拜拜
-See you.   -Bye.

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:01.460
你很痛  是吧
You're in so much pain, huh?

02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:02.840
-对   -是啊
-I am.   -Yeah.

02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:12.730
你们还好吗
Are you okay?

02:03:12.730 --> 02:03:14.120
嗯  我们没事
Yeah, we're okay.

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:16.560
-噢天啊  你流血了   -没事  我没事
-Oh, my God. You're bleeding.   -No. I'm okay.

02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:18.650
-你确定吗   -我真的没事  我保证
-Are you sure?   -I'm fine. I promise.

02:03:23.050 --> 02:03:25.390
我们该走了吧  是吧
We should go, right?

02:03:28.630 --> 02:03:30.470
你们将会忘记我是谁
You're gonna forget who I am.

02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:33.140
什么
What?

02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:35.180
忘记你是谁  你在说什么呀
Forget who you are, what are you talking about?

02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:37.400
没事的
It's okay...

02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:39.330
我会来找你们
I'm gonna come and find you,

02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:41.410
然后我会解释一切
and I'll explain everything.

02:03:42.810 --> 02:03:44.770
我会让你们记起我
I'll make you remember me.

02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:47.440
就像这一切都不曾发生过一样
It'll be like none of this ever happened.

02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:48.250
好吗
Okay?

02:03:48.250 --> 02:03:50.090
但如果行不通的话怎么办
But what if that doesn't work?

02:03:50.090 --> 02:03:52.850
如果行不通的话怎么办  如果我们记不起你该怎么办
What if that doesn't work, what if we can't remember you?

02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:54.440
我不想那样
I don't wanna do that.

02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:57.960
-我不想那样   -我懂  MJ  我懂
-I don't wanna do that.   -I know. MJ, I know.

02:03:58.200 --> 02:03:59.690
一定会有其他办法的
There's gotta be something we can do.

02:03:59.690 --> 02:04:02.840
我们能想个计划什么的吗  一定会有其他办法的
We can come up with like a plan or something? You know there's always something we can do.

02:04:04.890 --> 02:04:06.510
没有其他办法了
There's nothing we can do.

02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:12.100
但我们会没事的
But we'll be okay.

02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:17.530
你保证吗
Promise?

02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:21.700
对  我保证
Yeah, I promise.

02:04:33.210 --> 02:04:34.910
我会来找你们的  好吗
I'll come find you. Okay?

02:04:35.590 --> 02:04:37.020
我知道你会来的
I know you will.

02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:42.640
你最好来啊
You better.

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:47.250
你要是不来  我还会自己发现你的身份的
If you don't, I'm just gonna figure it out.

02:04:47.250 --> 02:04:50.120
毕竟我以前就做到过  我还能再来一回
I've done it before. I can do it again.

02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:52.080
我保证我会搞定这一切的
I promise I'll fix this.

02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:54.800
我真的恨死魔法了
I really hate magic.

02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:57.280
对啊  我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:03.270
我爱你
I love you.

02:05:09.450 --> 02:05:11.530
-我也爱你   -你发誓
-I love you...   -Swear that,

02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:14.880
当我们再次相遇的时候  你会告诉我一切
you will tell me if we meet again.

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:17.310
我发誓
Sure.

02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:28.050
自由女神像上的惨案已经过去几个星期了
It's been a few weeks since the fiasco on the Statue of Liberty,

02:07:28.050 --> 02:07:31.060
拥护蜘蛛侠的邪教徒们还坚持声称
and Spider-Man's cultists continue to contend

02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:33.840
这个罪大恶极的私警是个英雄
that the vile vigilante is a hero.

02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:38.780
但他要是个英雄  就该揭下面罩  亮明身份
But if he were a hero, he'd unmask himself and tell us who he really is.

02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:41.640
因为只有懦夫才会隐藏身份
Because only a coward conceals his identity.

02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:45.760
只有懦夫才会隐瞒心机
Only a coward hides his true intentions.

02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:47.690
女士们先生们  你们放心
Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen,

02:07:47.690 --> 02:07:50.540
我就算赴汤蹈火
this reporter will uncover those intentions,

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:52.080
也会把他的邪恶目的扒出来
come hell or high water.

02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:53.040
你好
Hi.

02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:56.120
我是彼得·帕克  你还不认识我  但我...
My name is Peter Parker. You don't know me, but I...

02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:01.430
我是彼得·帕克  你还不认识我  但...
My name is Peter Parker and you don't know me, but...

02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:06.040
好吧...来吧
Okay... Come on.

02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:20.790
你好啊
Hey.

02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:27.660
稍等
One sec.

02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:29.140
你要点什么
Can I help you?

02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:30.450
你好  呃...
Hi. Umm...

02:08:30.450 --> 02:08:32.250
我是彼得·帕克
My name is Peter Parker.

02:08:32.250 --> 02:08:33.630
我...
And I...

02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:39.370
想点杯咖啡  谢谢
would like a coffee. Please.

02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:43.180
好的  马上好  彼得·帕克
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:51.990
给我的工程师同学拿个甜甜圈
Donuts for my fellow engineer.

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:55.280
-等等  你说什么   -麻省理工  他们的吉祥物不是工程师吗
-Wait, what?   -MIT, they have the engineers, the mascot.

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:55.280
*注：麻省理工的吉祥物是一只海狸  海狸被誉为"大自然的工程师"

02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:58.020
啊对对对  我记下了
Oh, right, right, right. I should probably know that.

02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:00.190
看看  你已经很麻省了
Look at you with the school spirit.

02:09:00.190 --> 02:09:02.150
随你说吧  我可不认
Tell anybody. I would deny it.

02:09:02.150 --> 02:09:03.630
好吧
Oh, okay.

02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:13.460
乐意为您效劳

02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:14.790
彼得·帕克
Peter Parker?

02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:16.240
彼得·帕克
Peter Parker?

02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:17.760
你的咖啡
Your coffee.

02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:19.210
好  谢谢
Right. Thank you.

02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:23.970
要去麻省理工了  你激动吗
Are you excited for MIT?

02:09:25.150 --> 02:09:27.620
有那么点的
Right. Yeah.

02:09:28.770 --> 02:09:30.710
其实我是挺激动的  很怪
Yeah, actually I am excited, which is weird

02:09:30.710 --> 02:09:33.240
因为我一般不会因为什么事激动的
because I don't really get excited about things.

02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:34.810
我属于那种  提前做好会失望的准备
I kind of expect disappointment.

02:09:34.810 --> 02:09:37.730
因为那样的话你就永远不会真的失望
'Cause then you'd never actually be disappointed.

02:09:38.250 --> 02:09:39.300
对吧
Right?

02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:43.930
确实
Yeah. Right.

02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:46.170
怎么说呢  我也说不清...
It's just... I don't know...

02:09:46.170 --> 02:09:49.210
这次不知怎么的就不太一样了
It just kinda feels different this time for some reason.

02:09:59.970 --> 02:10:00.950
也是
Right.

02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:03.740
那真是...
That was...

02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:14.520
你没事吧
You okay?

02:10:15.710 --> 02:10:17.610
已经不疼了
Doesn't really hurt anymore.

02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:30.840
还需要什么吗
Is there anything else?

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:44.090
没了
No.

02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:49.270
谢谢
Thank you.

02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:51.380
不谢
No problem.

02:10:57.310 --> 02:10:58.780
再见了
I'll see you around.

02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:34.060
梅·帕克

02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:34.060
救一人即救众人

02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:05.500
你怎么认识她的
How do you know her?

02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:10.080
通过蜘蛛侠
Through Spider-Man.

02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:13.400
-你呢   -一样
-You?   -Same.

02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:21.120
不久前我一个好朋友过世了
I lost a good friend a while back.

02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:23.140
跟现在感觉一模一样
It felt like this.

02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:26.770
他们去世就已经让人心痛
Hurts cause they're gone,

02:12:26.770 --> 02:12:29.340
接着等你想起他们象征的意义  你又会心痛
and then it hurts all over again because you remember what they stood for,

02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:31.480
不禁就会想...
and you wonder...

02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:33.390
是不是连那些意义都不在了
Is all that gone too?

02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:39.430
不  那些还在
No, it's not gone.

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:44.000
她帮助过的每一个人...
Everybody she helped...

02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:47.360
他们会再帮助他人  将精神传递下去
they'll keep it going.

02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:49.830
你真这么觉得吗
You really think so?

02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:52.260
我很确定
I know it.

02:12:54.050 --> 02:12:55.470
保重  好吗
Take care of yourself, okay?

02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:57.690
好  很高兴认识你
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:06.940
这可是弗兰克这个月第一次
Frank's doing the first of the month.

02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:08.320
别迟到了
Don't be late.

02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:21.090
好
Okay,

02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:27.090
好的  好的  我好像明白了  你是说这个地方...
Okay, okay. I think I got this. You're saying that this whole place here...

02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:29.980
遍地都是...
It's just tons of...

02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:31.940
超能力人类
Superpeople.

02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:35.600
他都说了几个小时了
And he has been saying it for hours.

02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:39.030
行  再说一遍  抱歉  我蠢
All right, tell me again. I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:41.400
有那么个亿万富豪  他有铁罐战服
There was a billionaire. He had a tin suit,

02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:43.550
他还能飞  是吧
and he could fly. Right?

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:48.490
好的  还有个暴脾气的绿人
Okay. And there was a really angry green man.

02:17:48.490 --> 02:17:49.920
-浩克   -浩克
-Hulk.   -Hulk.

02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:52.490
就这你还觉得致命守护者这名字很烂
And you thought Lethal Protector was a shit name.

02:17:52.490 --> 02:17:53.780
本来就烂嘛
Yeah, because it is.

02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:58.880
你再跟我说说那个沉迷石头的紫薯外星人
Now, tell me again about your purple alien that loves stones.

02:17:58.890 --> 02:18:01.680
我跟你说啊  兄弟  外星人可不喜欢石头
'Cause I'll tell you what, man. Aliens, they do not love stones.

02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:03.550
-埃迪  快给我打住   -不不不  他们才不喜欢石头
-Eddie, don't start!  -No no no, the don't love stones.

02:18:03.550 --> 02:18:05.680
你知道外星人喜欢什么吗  吃脑子
You know what aliens love? Eating brains!

02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:08.030
