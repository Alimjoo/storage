You okay?

43:09.590 --> 43:11.717
Yeah. Great plan.

43:12.426 --> 43:15.470
I love the part
where I almost bled to death.

43:17.097 --> 43:18.432
This is cozy.

43:18.599 --> 43:21.185
Barton and I spent two days
hiding out up here.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.936
That must have been fun.

43:24.396 --> 43:26.064
Who the hell is that guy?

43:26.231 --> 43:27.608
Dreykov's special project.

43:28.150 --> 43:30.152
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

43:30.319 --> 43:31.445
It's like fighting a mirror.

43:32.154 --> 43:34.281
Dreykov only deploys him
for top-priority missions.

43:34.448 --> 43:36.116
This doesn't make any sense.

43:36.283 --> 43:39.745
Well, the truth rarely makes sense
when you omit key details.

43:41.580 --> 43:42.873
What is that supposed to mean?

43:43.040 --> 43:45.000
You didn't say one word
about Dreykov's daughter.

43:46.418 --> 43:47.711
You killed her.

43:48.378 --> 43:49.755
I had to.

43:51.048 --> 43:52.716
I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.

43:54.051 --> 43:56.553
BARTON: (ON RADIO) We need confirmation
Dreykov's in the building.

43:58.305 --> 43:59.598
NATASHA: His car is pulling up now.

44:17.199 --> 44:19.576
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

44:21.537 --> 44:23.413
I needed her to be sure.

44:23.747 --> 44:25.123
BARTON: (ON RADIO)
Natasha, we clear?

44:27.417 --> 44:28.418
All clear.

44:32.923 --> 44:35.050

44:35.425 --> 44:37.719
(SIGHS) I needed out.

44:53.318 --> 44:55.028
The Red Room's still active. Where is it?

44:55.195 --> 44:56.196
I have no idea.

44:56.947 --> 44:59.116
He moves location constantly.

44:59.283 --> 45:03.745
And every widow is sedated
on entry and exit for maximum security.

45:05.205 --> 45:08.458
I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.

45:08.625 --> 45:12.171
Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger
if you want to stay hidden.

45:12.337 --> 45:14.506
I mean, the clue is in the name.

45:14.673 --> 45:15.966
Dreykov kills you,

45:16.133 --> 45:18.886
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

45:19.052 --> 45:20.387
Wait, what are the big ones?

45:20.554 --> 45:24.933
Well, I doubt the god from space
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

45:27.436 --> 45:29.605
Where did you think I was all this time?

45:32.983 --> 45:36.695
I thought that you got out
and were living a normal life.

45:38.488 --> 45:40.115
And you just never made contact again?

45:40.282 --> 45:42.159
Honestly, I thought
you didn't wanna see me.

45:42.242 --> 45:44.870
(SCOFFS) Bullshit.

45:45.037 --> 45:47.706
You just didn't want
your baby sister to tag along,

45:47.873 --> 45:49.583
whilst you saved the world
with the cool kids.

45:49.750 --> 45:51.710
You weren't really my sister.

45:55.047 --> 45:57.591
And the Avengers
aren't really your family.

45:58.300 --> 46:00.135
-Why do you always do that thing?
-NATASHA: Do what?

46:00.302 --> 46:02.763
The thing you do when you're fighting.

46:02.930 --> 46:05.265
The... Like, the...

46:06.391 --> 46:08.185
This thing that you do

46:08.352 --> 46:10.395
when you whip your hair
when you're fighting

46:10.562 --> 46:12.022
with the arm and the hair.

46:12.105 --> 46:14.525
And you do, like,
a fighting pose. (LAUGHS)

46:14.608 --> 46:16.151
It's a... (LAUGHS)

46:16.235 --> 46:18.028
It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.

46:18.195 --> 46:20.113
-I'm not a poser.
-(LAUGHS)

46:20.197 --> 46:22.115
Oh, come on.
I mean, they're great poses,

46:22.282 --> 46:24.952
but it does look like
you think everyone's looking at you, like,

46:25.118 --> 46:26.119
all the time.

46:26.203 --> 46:29.623
All that time that I spent posing,
I was trying to actually do something good

46:29.790 --> 46:33.210
to make up for all the pain
and suffering that we caused.

46:33.585 --> 46:35.754
Trying to be more
than just a trained killer.

46:38.298 --> 46:41.051
Well, then you were fooling yourself

46:41.760 --> 46:45.556
because pain and suffering is every day
and we are both still a trained killer.

46:45.973 --> 46:48.934
Except I'm not the one
that's on the cover of a magazine.

46:49.101 --> 46:51.311
I'm not the killer
that little girls call their hero.

That gas,

47:11.707 --> 47:13.250
the counteragent,

47:13.584 --> 47:15.169
it was synthesized in secret

47:15.252 --> 47:18.005
by an older widow
from Melina's generation.

47:18.297 --> 47:21.550
I was on the mission to retrieve it,
and she exposed me

47:21.717 --> 47:25.554
and I killed the widow that freed me.

47:25.971 --> 47:27.306
Did you have a choice?

47:27.472 --> 47:30.267
What you experienced
was psychological conditioning.

47:31.810 --> 47:34.813
I'm talking about chemically
altering brain functions.

47:34.980 --> 47:37.191
They're two completely different things.

47:37.858 --> 47:41.612
You're fully conscious,
but you don't know which part is you.

47:41.778 --> 47:43.405
I'm still not sure.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.875
-Is that all there is left?
-Mmm-hmm.

47:55.834 --> 48:00.047
It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov
and his network of widows.

48:00.506 --> 48:02.007

to protect them.

48:07.262 --> 48:08.514
Just like us when we were small.

48:09.139 --> 48:11.642
Maybe one in 20 survives the training,
becomes a widow.

48:11.808 --> 48:13.185
The rest, he kills.

48:14.311 --> 48:16.146
To him, we are just things.

48:17.523 --> 48:20.567
Weapons with no face
that he can just throw away.

48:21.527 --> 48:24.488
Because there is always more.

48:25.030 --> 48:28.325

Well, my mom abandoned me
in the street like garbage.

What about you?

48:58.272 --> 49:01.942
They destroyed my birth certificate,
so I reinvented it.

49:02.860 --> 49:05.070

49:06.154 --> 49:08.073

especially after you had your son.

long enough to think about it.

49:40.147 --> 49:42.274

49:50.115 --> 49:51.700

49:53.243 --> 49:56.455
I don't really have
anywhere to go back to,

49:56.538 --> 49:58.123
so I guess anywhere.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.465
-Don't.
-Don't what?

50:06.548 --> 50:09.092
(CHUCKLES) You're going to
give me some big hero speech,

50:09.176 --> 50:10.177
I can feel it.

50:11.428 --> 50:13.096
Speeches aren't really my thing.

50:13.180 --> 50:14.181
Huh.

50:14.890 --> 50:16.558
It was more like an invitation.

50:17.726 --> 50:20.187
To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?

50:20.812 --> 50:21.813
Yeah.

50:21.980 --> 50:24.233
Even though the Red Room
is impossible to find

50:24.316 --> 50:26.360
and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?

50:26.568 --> 50:27.569

Could be fun, though.

50:38.163 --> 50:39.373
Yup.

50:46.129 --> 50:47.422

You know, this is
the first piece of clothing

51:03.105 --> 51:04.606

That?

51:08.569 --> 51:09.570
Yeah. You don't like it?

51:09.736 --> 51:11.280
Is that like a...

51:12.322 --> 51:13.365
Is it army surplus, or...

51:13.532 --> 51:14.992
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

51:24.418 --> 51:27.713
I've never had control
over my own life before, and now I do.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.548
I want to do things.

51:30.424 --> 51:31.508

It's so cool, right?

51:36.013 --> 51:37.139
It's good. Yes. I like it.

51:37.306 --> 51:40.684
And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.

51:44.938 --> 51:46.815

the Red Room is, though.

51:46.899 --> 51:48.984
-I'm sorry.
-I know.

51:49.151 --> 51:51.987

52:01.705 --> 52:03.290

was just a calculated ruse
that only lasted three years,

I don't think that we can use
this term anymore, can we?

01:11:57.526 --> 01:11:59.987
Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...

that they could stay up late
to catch Santa Claus.

No, you weren't abandoned.

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:33.422
You were selected by a program

But your mother,
she never stopped looking for you.

01:18:54.276 --> 01:18:57.196
She was like you in that way.
She was

01:18:57.362 --> 01:18:58.906

01:18:59.656 --> 01:19:01.283
What happened to her?

01:19:02.993 --> 01:19:04.745
Dreykov had her killed.

to uncover the Red Room.

Normally, the actions
of one curious civilian

01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:13.504
wouldn't warrant an execution,

01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:16.381
but, as I said, she was relentless.

01:19:19.134 --> 01:19:21.970
I thought about her every day of my life.

01:19:26.558 --> 01:19:29.394
Whether or not I admitted it to myself,
I did.

01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:34.233
I've always found it best
not to look into the past.

01:19:45.369 --> 01:19:46.870
Then why did you save this?

01:20:04.805 --> 01:20:06.723

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:10.853
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter
and summer vacation all in one day.

-Mmm.

were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

-Hey. Hey.

01:58:08.714 --> 01:58:10.299

01:58:48.670 --> 01:58:50.088

We're closing in on the target, sir.

01:59:14.488 --> 01:59:16.448
So, what's our plan?

01:59:17.366 --> 01:59:19.952
You guys go. I'll stay.

Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.

01:59:39.221 --> 01:59:41.765
I know how much you like it.
