WEBVTT

01:46.859 --> 01:48.235
It is time.

02:24.230 --> 02:25.689
It's beautiful, isn't it?

02:26.774 --> 02:28.359
I'm Ikaris.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.694
I'm Sersi.

05:46.348 --> 05:48.142
Thank you, Ajak.

07:32.621 --> 07:33.998
Shit.

07:37.543 --> 07:40.379
Excuse me. Excuse me.

07:59.106 --> 08:00.941
I know I'm late, Charlie.

08:06.155 --> 08:07.990
"In this broad Earth of ours,

08:08.157 --> 08:11.493
"Amid the measureless grossness
and the slag,

08:11.660 --> 08:14.872
"Enclosed and safe
within its central heart,

08:15.039 --> 08:17.625
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

08:18.459 --> 08:21.378
The poet's hope and optimism in humanity...

08:21.545 --> 08:26.008
echoes our recent universal victory,
the return of half our population...

08:26.175 --> 08:27.259
And, thank God, there she is.

08:28.761 --> 08:31.972
Our brilliant museum scientist, Ms. Sersi,
the person who will be...

08:32.139 --> 08:35.683
and was always supposed to be
giving you your presentation today.

08:35.893 --> 08:38.687
Thank you, Mr. Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

08:38.854 --> 08:43.734
Today, we'll be learning about the importance
of apex predators in a balanced ecosystem.

08:45.069 --> 08:46.070
Poetry?

08:46.237 --> 08:49.782
I completely ran out of things to say,
and these kids make me nervous.

08:49.949 --> 08:52.159
Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

08:52.743 --> 08:53.786
See you tonight.

08:53.953 --> 08:55.913
Ooh! "See you tonight."

08:56.664 --> 08:58.332
All right, settle down.

09:00.835 --> 09:01.836
So...

09:02.294 --> 09:04.713
who can tell me what an apex predator is?

09:05.172 --> 09:06.882
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

09:07.049 --> 09:08.217
Very good.

09:08.384 --> 09:12.054
Apex predators do hunt their prey for food,
like all predators.

09:12.221 --> 09:14.098
But one thing that sets them apart...

09:14.265 --> 09:18.894
is that there are no other animals
in their habitat strong enough to hunt them.

09:20.145 --> 09:21.480
Who can give me an example?

09:21.647 --> 09:22.648
Lions.

09:22.815 --> 09:24.567
-Wolves.
-Correct.

09:27.194 --> 09:28.404
Earthquake.

09:31.699 --> 09:32.825
Get down. Get down!

09:32.992 --> 09:35.828
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

09:36.996 --> 09:39.999
Let me help you.
Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

09:48.048 --> 09:49.967
It's all right. Come here.

09:51.886 --> 09:54.096
You're all right. You're all right.

10:37.223 --> 10:38.682
I like this song.

10:38.849 --> 10:39.975
Me, too.

10:41.018 --> 10:42.353
Do you wanna dance?

10:43.312 --> 10:44.480
Wait, what the hell?

10:45.439 --> 10:46.649
Your hand!

10:47.399 --> 10:51.237
You've had too much to drink.
I gotta go.

10:56.367 --> 11:00.788
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

11:00.955 --> 11:05.960
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dane</i>

11:06.126 --> 11:10.089
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

11:10.256 --> 11:12.216
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

11:19.098 --> 11:20.641
Is this from the Middle Ages?

11:20.808 --> 11:22.101
It has your family crest.

11:22.476 --> 11:24.728
It must have cost a fortune.

11:24.895 --> 11:26.522
I'm a good eBay bidder.

11:26.689 --> 11:27.690
Thank you.

11:28.357 --> 11:29.650
Happy birthday.

11:33.237 --> 11:37.908
So, have you given any more thought
to us moving in together?

11:38.075 --> 11:40.244
Yeah, I thought about it.

11:41.412 --> 11:43.414
I can't move in with you.

11:43.581 --> 11:45.416
Yeah. Thought you'd say that.

11:45.583 --> 11:46.417
I'm sorry.

11:46.584 --> 11:49.086
And I think I know why.

11:51.046 --> 11:52.464
Are you a wizard?

11:52.965 --> 11:53.966
What?

11:54.133 --> 11:55.926
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

11:56.093 --> 11:57.094
No. I'm...

11:57.261 --> 11:59.555
I've noticed some unusual things
happen when I'm around you.

11:59.722 --> 12:02.808
Like our water always turns to coffee
whenever the waiter ignores us.

12:02.975 --> 12:03.976
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

12:04.143 --> 12:06.395
And Sprite says things...

12:07.021 --> 12:10.065
like you and your ex-boyfriend
broke up a century ago.

12:10.691 --> 12:11.692
She said that?

12:11.859 --> 12:13.068
And he can fly.

12:13.569 --> 12:15.154
He's a pilot.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.115
Get a room, you two.

12:18.282 --> 12:20.743
Can we go now?
It's past my bedtime.

12:24.872 --> 12:26.916
Are you really in love?

12:27.082 --> 12:28.334
What if I am?

12:28.501 --> 12:30.669
You better tell him the truth, then.

12:30.836 --> 12:32.463
I'm working on it.

12:43.974 --> 12:45.476
You guys wanna get pizza?

12:45.643 --> 12:46.894
No, thank you!

12:48.771 --> 12:52.233
He won't live forever, you know.
Move in with him.

12:52.858 --> 12:54.109
I live with you.

12:56.403 --> 12:57.530
Dane.

13:00.366 --> 13:02.117
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

13:02.284 --> 13:03.911
Dane, run!

13:15.381 --> 13:16.549
-Sersi?
-Let's go.

13:18.259 --> 13:20.636
-What is that thing?
-A Deviant!

13:20.803 --> 13:21.971
You said you killed them all!

13:22.137 --> 13:23.138
You told him that?

13:23.305 --> 13:24.932
-You believed me?
-I do now!

13:31.647 --> 13:33.190
What are you doing?

13:33.357 --> 13:34.400
Keep Dane safe!

13:34.567 --> 13:36.443
Sersi, wait! What?

13:44.910 --> 13:46.036
You're fine, dude.

13:46.203 --> 13:47.329
Sprite!

13:52.543 --> 13:54.461
No. Stairs.

14:31.498 --> 14:34.210
Run! Go! Go!

14:34.376 --> 14:35.753
-Go!
-Come on!

14:43.427 --> 14:44.803
It knows where we are!

14:45.221 --> 14:46.055
How?

14:46.222 --> 14:47.723
I don't know!

14:49.183 --> 14:50.184
Sprite!

14:56.148 --> 14:57.149
Sprite!

15:16.335 --> 15:17.419
Ikaris!

15:19.046 --> 15:20.506
Evening, ladies.

15:22.341 --> 15:23.425
Watch out!

15:39.650 --> 15:40.943
Wizard.

15:44.738 --> 15:45.823
Sorry.

16:07.052 --> 16:08.929
Did it just heal itself?

16:28.365 --> 16:29.575
Ikaris.

16:30.951 --> 16:33.245
It's good to see you.

16:33.704 --> 16:35.539
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

16:41.754 --> 16:43.464
I'm Dane.

16:43.631 --> 16:45.049
Hello, Dane.

16:45.591 --> 16:47.760
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

17:01.315 --> 17:04.484
We're Eternals, from a planet called Olympia.

17:05.152 --> 17:08.071
We came here 7,000 years ago on the <i>Domo...</i>

17:08.239 --> 17:11.659
our starship,
to protect humans from the Deviants.

17:12.617 --> 17:16.829
We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago, but now they're back.

17:19.290 --> 17:21.377
Look, if you don't want to move in with me,
you could just say.

17:21.544 --> 17:23.002
Dane, this is serious.

17:23.170 --> 17:26.173
I know. I'm just still getting over
the fact you're not a wizard.

17:26.715 --> 17:28.342
I was hoping you could change me
into a giraffe.

17:28.509 --> 17:30.010
I always wanted to be a giraffe
when I was a kid.

17:30.177 --> 17:32.471
It's too bad I can't change sentient beings.

17:32.638 --> 17:33.973
You would have made a very cute giraffe.

17:39.144 --> 17:41.188
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

17:41.480 --> 17:44.567
Or any war? Or all the other terrible things
throughout history?

17:45.067 --> 17:47.319
We were instructed
not to interfere in any human conflicts...

17:47.486 --> 17:48.529
unless Deviants were involved.

17:48.696 --> 17:49.905
Why?

17:50.072 --> 17:55.244
If we'd protected humanity from everything
for 7,000 years...

17:55.411 --> 17:59.290
you'd never have had the chance to
develop in the way you were meant to.

17:59.456 --> 18:03.669
But if the Deviants were eradicated
a long time ago...

18:03.836 --> 18:05.171
why are you still here?

18:05.337 --> 18:06.422
We've been waiting...

18:06.881 --> 18:08.924
to be told we can go home.

18:10.759 --> 18:11.969
So...

18:12.803 --> 18:14.013
Ikaris.

18:14.847 --> 18:16.765
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

18:17.266 --> 18:19.602
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

18:19.768 --> 18:22.062
In the fifth century BC?

18:22.229 --> 18:23.898
How long were you two together?

18:24.064 --> 18:25.566
5,000 years.

18:26.942 --> 18:28.944
I guess you can call that long-term.

18:30.112 --> 18:31.447
What happened?

18:31.822 --> 18:33.532
He left.

18:33.991 --> 18:37.286
I always thought he'd come back, but...

18:37.786 --> 18:39.538
he never did.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.498
So, I moved on.

18:41.957 --> 18:43.334
I'm glad you did.

18:44.376 --> 18:45.377
I'm sorry.

18:46.879 --> 18:48.297
I have to go.

18:57.515 --> 18:59.975
<i>This morning,
an unprecedented global earthquake...</i>

19:00.142 --> 19:01.727
<i>swept nation-states across the world...</i>

19:01.894 --> 19:03.938
<i>causing damage and panic.</i>

19:04.104 --> 19:06.690
<i>Many have speculated its connection
with the Blip.</i>

19:07.149 --> 19:09.109
<i>The UN has called for an emergency meeting...</i>

19:09.276 --> 19:11.403
That Deviant healed itself.

19:12.404 --> 19:14.448
They could never do that before.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.620
And it was coming after us instead of humans.
What's going on?

19:19.787 --> 19:22.498
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

19:22.665 --> 19:24.750
That Deviant is news to me.

19:27.753 --> 19:29.588
Something's happening to Earth.

19:30.881 --> 19:32.675
Can't be a coincidence.

19:34.176 --> 19:35.928
We need to find the others.

19:36.554 --> 19:38.514
I haven't seen some of them for centuries.

19:38.681 --> 19:40.599
I doubt much has changed.

19:50.818 --> 19:53.612
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

19:59.201 --> 20:01.120
But we need to stick together.

20:02.621 --> 20:04.582
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

20:05.791 --> 20:07.877
Let's go to Ajak first.

20:08.836 --> 20:10.754
She'll know what to do.

20:14.592 --> 20:16.302
You hear that, Sprite?

20:17.052 --> 20:18.971
Family reunion.

20:19.138 --> 20:20.848
It's about time.

20:32.943 --> 20:35.237
Hey, that one was mine!
Never mind.

22:10.457 --> 22:11.584
Ajak.

22:12.668 --> 22:13.752
Arishem.

22:14.628 --> 22:17.798
We continue to keep Babylon safe
from the Deviants.

22:17.965 --> 22:20.467
More people have come to seek refuge.

22:20.634 --> 22:23.387
It is now the largest city on Earth.

22:23.554 --> 22:26.390
The Eternals serving their missions
across the galaxies...

22:26.557 --> 22:28.267
will learn from your success.

22:28.684 --> 22:29.810
Thank you.

22:32.855 --> 22:36.066
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

22:37.151 --> 22:40.863
But I have noticed something special
about this planet.

22:42.990 --> 22:46.285
And I fear that maybe this time
the cost may...

22:46.452 --> 22:49.163
Do not become attached to this planet.

22:49.330 --> 22:53.167
You must focus on the true purpose
of your mission.

22:54.585 --> 22:56.086
I understand.

22:57.338 --> 22:59.173
I will not let you down.

23:23.864 --> 23:24.907
Phastos.

23:25.074 --> 23:27.993
Did you go to the party last night
like I told you to?

23:28.160 --> 23:29.161
The party, yeah.

23:29.328 --> 23:30.829
-Yeah, it was...
-He worked all night.

23:31.247 --> 23:32.248
Who was talking to you?

23:32.414 --> 23:34.583
Get a life.
And where is Sersi?

23:34.750 --> 23:35.751
Late as usual.

23:35.918 --> 23:38.921
I'm sorry, but I have something
very exciting to show you, okay?

23:39.964 --> 23:41.799
Wait till you see this.

23:45.594 --> 23:46.595
What is it?

23:46.762 --> 23:48.305
It's an engine.

23:48.472 --> 23:51.517
It moves steam from high pressure
to low pressure.

23:52.142 --> 23:54.728
It'll help them till their fields
at an incredibly fast rate.

23:55.104 --> 23:56.272
It's gonna freak them out.

23:56.689 --> 23:59.275
I mean, they only have
had the wheel 1,000 years, so...

24:00.526 --> 24:04.363
You know, we could do that thing
where you use your mind to control them...

24:04.530 --> 24:05.531
and then they could do it quicker.

24:05.698 --> 24:06.949
Ajak, you listening to this?

24:07.116 --> 24:09.952
Phastos, this steam...

24:10.119 --> 24:12.121
-Engine. It's a steam engine.
-It's too soon.

24:12.705 --> 24:13.706
And there she is.

24:14.123 --> 24:15.583
What did I miss?

24:15.833 --> 24:19.795
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

24:19.962 --> 24:21.881
I am sure you have something simpler.

24:22.047 --> 24:22.882
Simple.

24:23.048 --> 24:24.633
Okay, let's see.

24:25.968 --> 24:28.929
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

24:30.264 --> 24:31.599
the plow.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.560
'Cause that's what it does.

24:34.727 --> 24:36.020
Plows dirt.

24:36.187 --> 24:39.440
I met another group of settlers who are
building their homes in the northern fields.

24:39.607 --> 24:40.983
They'll need to plant their own crops.

24:41.525 --> 24:43.110
-Thanks, Sersi.
-Listen...

24:43.694 --> 24:47.156
humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

24:48.115 --> 24:52.870
But there is no telling what wonders
they will discover as they advance.

25:23.025 --> 25:24.026
I just saw that.

25:24.193 --> 25:26.070
There's so many other chairs, man.

25:26.237 --> 25:27.404
You know, I could use my powers...

25:27.571 --> 25:29.156
Come and have a drink with me.

25:29.615 --> 25:30.616
No.

25:30.783 --> 25:32.535
I can't let you go
and fight Deviants on your own.

25:32.701 --> 25:34.870
-We need to guard the city.
-Get out of my way.

25:35.621 --> 25:38.499
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

25:38.999 --> 25:42.419
We need to trust Arishem's design
for this planet.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.840
Thena.

25:48.133 --> 25:50.678
It's an honor to fight alongside you.

25:52.304 --> 25:53.556
And you.

25:57.101 --> 26:00.145
My beautiful Makkari. You're late.

26:55.075 --> 26:59.121
Well, she also says that
stealing is very, very bad.

27:06.212 --> 27:07.338
Deal.

27:18.849 --> 27:21.894
I promise I won't let my feelings for Sersi
distract me from my mission.

27:22.061 --> 27:25.231
Humans are far from being able to
protect themselves from the Deviants.

27:25.773 --> 27:27.316
We still have much to do.

27:28.984 --> 27:30.986
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

27:31.570 --> 27:33.072
I can feel it.

27:34.823 --> 27:37.284
But you are allowed to live a life, you know?

27:37.993 --> 27:40.329
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

28:06.522 --> 28:07.731
Try.

28:09.358 --> 28:11.360
Sorry. I'm making a mess.

28:14.572 --> 28:15.990
Well, not bad.

28:50.107 --> 28:51.275
It matches your eyes.

28:54.236 --> 28:56.155
You're learning their language now?

28:56.322 --> 28:58.449
If I want to spend more time with you...

28:58.616 --> 29:00.576
I need to get to know them.

29:06.957 --> 29:07.958
Wait, what did I say?

29:08.125 --> 29:11.337
You said, "I am very beautiful."

29:14.507 --> 29:15.549
You...

29:18.344 --> 29:21.055
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

29:32.983 --> 29:34.527
I'm yours, Sersi...

29:35.694 --> 29:36.695
if you'll have me.

30:21.657 --> 30:23.242
I love you, Ikaris.

30:26.036 --> 30:27.663
I love you, Sersi.

31:35.105 --> 31:36.398
Hello?

31:40.069 --> 31:41.237
Ajak?

32:06.011 --> 32:07.638
Ajak!

32:33.581 --> 32:35.249
It was a Deviant.

32:42.673 --> 32:45.092
<i>Our love</i>

32:45.259 --> 32:48.596
<i>And our devotion</i>

32:49.263 --> 32:54.268
<i>Were as deep as any ocean</i>

32:59.190 --> 33:01.275
It was the last time I saw her.

33:03.152 --> 33:07.323
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,
so I went to London.

33:09.533 --> 33:12.953
Turned out, both of us were lonely
and we needed each other.

33:14.747 --> 33:16.790
I guess, in her way...

33:16.957 --> 33:19.960
Ajak never stopped trying to take care of us.

33:28.511 --> 33:29.887
Bye, Ajak.

33:34.475 --> 33:36.977
It's the first time in 7,000 years
one of us has died.

33:37.520 --> 33:40.064
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London...

33:40.231 --> 33:42.024
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

33:42.191 --> 33:43.901
Deviants have never done that in the past.

33:44.068 --> 33:46.111
It healed itself just like Ajak.

33:46.612 --> 33:49.198
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

34:16.225 --> 34:17.059
Arishem.

34:17.226 --> 34:18.185
Sersi.

34:18.351 --> 34:19.978
It is almost time.

34:21.856 --> 34:24.065
Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?

34:24.650 --> 34:26.110
What happened, Sersi?

34:29.321 --> 34:31.739
The sphere
that Ajak used to talk with Arishem...

34:31.907 --> 34:34.409
it came out of her body and went inside me.

34:34.577 --> 34:36.286
Did you talk with Arishem?

34:36.911 --> 34:38.539
Yes. He said...

34:39.123 --> 34:40.875
it's almost time.

34:42.126 --> 34:43.835
Can you try talking to him again?

34:44.795 --> 34:46.213
I don't know how.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.257
But she chose you to replace her.

34:48.924 --> 34:50.176
And she gave you the sphere.

34:50.342 --> 34:51.427
Hold on, Sprite.

34:53.137 --> 34:54.554
Are you sure you talked with Arishem?

34:54.722 --> 34:56.015
What else would it be?

34:57.266 --> 34:58.517
Mahd Wy'ry.

35:34.803 --> 35:36.055
Where are the others?

35:39.850 --> 35:41.477
There were more Deviants than you said.

35:41.644 --> 35:43.312
Well, I'm sure that was a lot of fun for you.

35:43.646 --> 35:44.855
It was.

35:47.024 --> 35:49.109
Once the others kill these last Deviants...

35:49.860 --> 35:52.112
we will have eliminated them all
from the planet.

36:10.214 --> 36:11.549
Don't.

36:12.883 --> 36:15.344
We don't interfere in their wars.

36:16.470 --> 36:18.013
This isn't war.

36:18.180 --> 36:19.974
It's genocide.

36:20.349 --> 36:22.393
Their weapons have become too deadly.

36:23.769 --> 36:26.939
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
helping them advance, Phastos.

36:27.147 --> 36:30.693
Technology is a part of
their evolutionary process, Druig.

36:30.860 --> 36:32.403
It's not exactly something that I can stop.

36:32.570 --> 36:34.572
No, you can't. But I can.

36:36.657 --> 36:38.325
It's too late.

36:38.492 --> 36:40.953
-Thena?
-Everyone is going to die.

36:42.079 --> 36:43.080
Are you okay?

36:44.498 --> 36:45.499
Thena?

36:48.752 --> 36:50.588
-Thena? Thena, no!
-Thena!

37:19.783 --> 37:22.119
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.080
Listen to my voice.

37:26.790 --> 37:28.459
You are safe.

37:29.585 --> 37:32.171
You are loved.

37:33.088 --> 37:34.882
You're our Thena.

37:42.181 --> 37:43.349
Hey, Thena!

37:43.516 --> 37:45.768
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

38:04.078 --> 38:05.663
-Is she okay?
-Yeah.

38:06.956 --> 38:08.082
Sersi.

38:08.249 --> 38:09.250
Thena, please.

38:09.875 --> 38:11.335
Come back to us.

38:12.002 --> 38:13.045
Okay.

38:29.603 --> 38:31.730
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

38:35.150 --> 38:36.819
There is no cure...

38:37.695 --> 38:39.154
so no one really talks about it.

38:43.993 --> 38:44.994
What happened?

38:45.160 --> 38:46.245
Thena.

38:46.412 --> 38:47.955
You attacked everyone.

38:48.372 --> 38:50.749
Wounded Sersi, Phastos...

38:50.916 --> 38:52.877
you nearly killed Makkari.

38:55.337 --> 38:57.173
I don't remember.

38:57.339 --> 38:59.425
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

38:59.592 --> 39:03.762
Your mind is fracturing
under the weight of your memories.

39:03.929 --> 39:08.184
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

39:09.310 --> 39:12.563
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship...

39:12.730 --> 39:15.566
where we have the technology to help you.

39:18.152 --> 39:20.112
What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

39:20.279 --> 39:21.780
She could have killed all of us.

39:21.947 --> 39:22.948
Please.

39:24.617 --> 39:27.119
Please, I want to remember.

39:28.162 --> 39:30.039
I want to remember my life.

39:30.664 --> 39:32.166
Thena, I love you.

39:32.333 --> 39:33.959
But listen to me.

39:34.126 --> 39:37.713
It's not important if you remember or not.

39:38.255 --> 39:40.007
Your spirit will remain.

39:40.174 --> 39:42.968
You will always be Thena deep inside.

39:43.427 --> 39:44.428
Trust me.

39:44.595 --> 39:45.846
Why should she trust you?

39:47.640 --> 39:50.267
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

39:50.434 --> 39:52.269
Druig, I know you're upset, but...

39:52.436 --> 39:53.479
Upset?

39:55.481 --> 39:58.692
We've trusted you for 7,000 years,
and look where you've gotten us.

40:00.194 --> 40:05.199
I've watched humans destroy each other
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

40:06.992 --> 40:09.745
Do you know what that does to someone
after centuries?

40:11.038 --> 40:13.123
Could our mission have been a mistake?

40:13.916 --> 40:17.127
Are we really helping these people
build a better world, huh?

40:26.178 --> 40:28.556
We're just like the soldiers down there.

40:29.390 --> 40:31.559
Pawns to their leaders.

40:32.226 --> 40:34.311
Blinded by loyalty.

40:37.356 --> 40:39.066
It ends now.

40:56.834 --> 40:57.835
Let them go.

40:58.002 --> 40:59.336
You're gonna have to make me.

40:59.503 --> 41:00.504
Stop.

41:07.052 --> 41:08.596
If you wanna stop me...

41:09.889 --> 41:11.765
you're gonna have to kill me.

41:35.497 --> 41:37.333
I'll watch over Thena.

41:38.042 --> 41:39.126
Let her keep her memories.

41:40.377 --> 41:42.421
One day, when she attacks you...

41:43.047 --> 41:45.090
you might have to kill her.

41:51.222 --> 41:52.973
We'll take that chance.

42:02.775 --> 42:03.943
You may all go.

42:06.403 --> 42:08.113
The Deviants are gone.

42:08.989 --> 42:11.951
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

42:12.117 --> 42:13.702
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

42:13.869 --> 42:15.704
We're a team, we should stay together.

42:15.871 --> 42:18.791
I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris.

42:18.958 --> 42:21.293
Do not forget your place.

42:24.505 --> 42:26.757
This is where we say goodbye.

42:27.883 --> 42:29.468
You are free to go.

42:30.845 --> 42:33.013
I want you to go out there.

42:33.180 --> 42:35.933
And live a life for yourselves.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.852
Not as soldiers.

42:38.561 --> 42:41.522
Not with the purpose
you were given.

42:41.897 --> 42:44.692
Find your own purpose.

42:45.568 --> 42:49.738
And one day, when we see each other again...

42:52.199 --> 42:55.202
I want you to tell me what you found.

42:59.582 --> 43:01.500
<i>Come my way</i>

43:02.918 --> 43:05.171
<i>Get the evil away</i>

43:06.547 --> 43:08.757
<i>You came to save</i>

43:10.259 --> 43:12.511
<i>And now you're here</i>

43:15.973 --> 43:19.435
<i>Now you have come home
Give it all to me</i>

43:19.602 --> 43:23.314
<i>You would risk it all
For my victory</i>

43:23.480 --> 43:27.401
<i>Waiting for you
Scarcely can I</i>

44:05.147 --> 44:07.441
I am Karun Patel.

44:08.067 --> 44:09.318
Kingo's valet.

44:10.152 --> 44:13.531
It's truly an honor to be in the presence
of the great Eternals.

44:15.324 --> 44:18.786
<i>The ring of fire
Like the sun</i>

44:18.953 --> 44:22.623
<i>You have risen
Mighty one</i>

44:31.674 --> 44:34.802
Cut! Okay, everyone, that was good.

44:34.969 --> 44:36.720
But we could do 10% better.

44:36.887 --> 44:38.973
That was beautiful. Very, very good.

44:39.139 --> 44:40.140
Really, so good.

44:41.225 --> 44:43.310
My friends from college are here.

44:44.019 --> 44:44.854
Hello, boss!

44:45.563 --> 44:48.148
Perfect timing! Welcome to the set of...

44:51.277 --> 44:52.361
I'm playing you!

44:52.528 --> 44:54.196
-You like the costume?
-We need to talk.

44:54.363 --> 44:55.698
Tell the director
I have some notes for him...

44:55.865 --> 44:57.032
We need to talk to you in private.

44:57.658 --> 45:01.120
Oh, Karun, he's worked with me for 50 years.
I trust him completely.

45:01.287 --> 45:03.706
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire...

45:03.873 --> 45:05.165
and he tried to stake me through the heart.

45:05.708 --> 45:07.418
I have apologized so many times.

45:07.585 --> 45:10.171
Not quite enough times. Very close, though.
I'll let you know.

45:10.337 --> 45:13.340
I have to get ready for the next scene.
Come to my tent, we'll talk there.

45:13.507 --> 45:14.675
You guys are gonna love the next scene.

45:14.842 --> 45:17.761
I come in on a wire
'cause, you know, I can't fly.

45:17.928 --> 45:19.680
Wait, are we getting back together?

45:19.847 --> 45:20.848
We need to talk.

45:21.015 --> 45:21.974
I've been waiting for the day...

45:22.141 --> 45:24.310
the world learns the true identity
of the Shadow Warrior.

45:24.476 --> 45:25.936
Ajak's dead.

45:31.025 --> 45:32.401
She was killed.

45:33.319 --> 45:34.695
It was a Deviant.

45:39.241 --> 45:40.868
The Deviants are back.

45:41.035 --> 45:42.494
We don't know how many there are.

45:46.415 --> 45:47.833
You need to come with us.

46:04.058 --> 46:06.185
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

46:06.352 --> 46:08.896
We just started shooting this movie.
It's the first of a trilogy.

46:09.522 --> 46:11.524
We just got BTS to do a cameo...

46:13.108 --> 46:14.276
Sir...

46:14.693 --> 46:16.654
-may I say something?
-Please don't say anything.

46:16.820 --> 46:17.863
I think you should go.

46:18.030 --> 46:19.240
I just said don't say anything.

46:19.406 --> 46:23.661
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"

46:24.537 --> 46:26.497
Remember? It's your favorite line...

46:26.664 --> 46:31.168
from <i>The Shadow Warrior 2: Voyage of Time.</i>

46:31.919 --> 46:33.754
Your family needs you.

46:44.682 --> 46:46.851
Seven thousand years.

46:48.644 --> 46:52.356
That's how long the battle between Eternals
and Deviants has raged for.

46:52.982 --> 46:54.984
You think I'm a movie star.

46:55.150 --> 46:57.987
<i>Well, I am. But I am also...</i>

46:58.904 --> 47:00.489
<i>an Eternal.</i>

47:00.656 --> 47:02.157
<i>Kingo, what are you doing?</i>

47:03.033 --> 47:06.287
I think we should be remembered, so...

47:06.453 --> 47:10.499
I am making a documentary about us.

47:10.666 --> 47:13.669
You are about to meet
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

47:13.836 --> 47:16.046
Sprite, tell them about yourself.

47:16.213 --> 47:17.548
Oh, wait.

47:21.427 --> 47:23.929
<i>Okay, well, we'll circle back to her.</i>

47:24.597 --> 47:26.807
This is Sersi.

47:27.391 --> 47:28.392
Sersi...

47:28.559 --> 47:30.394
tell them about yourself.

47:32.646 --> 47:33.647
<i>We're rolling.</i>

47:33.814 --> 47:34.648
<i>Well...</i>

47:36.317 --> 47:40.905
I can change a rock into water.

47:41.697 --> 47:44.200
I could turn a rock into wood.

47:44.366 --> 47:46.452
Or a rock into metal.

47:46.619 --> 47:48.787
Actually, one time, I turned a rock into air.

47:48.954 --> 47:49.830
Cut.

47:50.414 --> 47:54.043
You know what? Why don't you think about it,
and we'll get back to you, okay?

47:54.210 --> 47:55.461
Let's go.

47:58.172 --> 48:00.508
Sprite says you're addicted to this thing.

48:02.635 --> 48:03.802
Oh, this?

48:04.678 --> 48:06.180
Look at this.

48:09.016 --> 48:11.143
You know, seeing as we don't age.

48:11.644 --> 48:13.479
I think you look quite good.

48:15.064 --> 48:16.065
Don't you?

48:20.236 --> 48:24.114
Nobody ever wonders how you managed to be
the leading man for over 100 years?

48:24.281 --> 48:25.824
I don't know what you're talking about.

48:25.991 --> 48:28.160
That is my great-great-grandfather...

48:28.327 --> 48:30.663
that is my great-grandfather...

48:30.829 --> 48:31.830
grandfather...

48:31.997 --> 48:34.041
father, and me.

48:34.208 --> 48:37.211
I'm part of the greatest dynasty
in the history of Bollywood.

48:37.670 --> 48:38.671
Pretty impressive, right?

48:38.838 --> 48:40.881
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

48:42.633 --> 48:46.095
Okay, I got sick of moving every five years.

48:46.262 --> 48:49.223
People freak out
when they notice that you don't...

48:51.308 --> 48:52.309
age.

48:53.561 --> 48:55.020
I thought we were friends.

49:02.027 --> 49:03.904
Do you know why I love movies?

49:04.780 --> 49:06.365
Because of you.

49:06.532 --> 49:09.326
I missed sitting in the audience,
listening to your stories...

49:09.493 --> 49:10.744
watching your illusions.

49:15.583 --> 49:17.793
We should've all stayed together.

49:19.795 --> 49:21.881
Ajak would still be alive.

49:23.465 --> 49:25.259
She should have never let us go.

49:36.103 --> 49:37.897
This is the Deviant you fought in London?

49:38.314 --> 49:39.732
It's different.

49:40.524 --> 49:42.568
There must be more out there than we thought.

49:44.153 --> 49:46.155
Is this a Deviant, sir?

49:46.322 --> 49:47.364
Yep.

49:48.282 --> 49:49.992
It's a beautiful creature.

49:50.159 --> 49:53.621
What? This? This?
No. It's hideous.

49:53.787 --> 49:56.415
You've never had one
try to bite your head off. Roll.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.295
You're about to meet two of the
greatest warriors the world has ever known.

50:01.754 --> 50:05.174
<i>Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.</i>

50:05.341 --> 50:07.051
And her trusty friend...

50:07.218 --> 50:08.302
Door.

50:09.011 --> 50:10.930
...a mighty powerhouse of strength...

50:11.096 --> 50:14.058
<i>the fearsome Gilgamesh!</i>

50:16.560 --> 50:17.603
Gilgamesh!

50:20.606 --> 50:22.191
<i>What took you so long?</i>

50:25.319 --> 50:27.112
You look younger today, Sprite.

50:27.279 --> 50:28.781
I have the same apron.

50:29.281 --> 50:30.574
Who the hell are you?

50:30.991 --> 50:33.077
I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.

50:33.702 --> 50:36.330
Oh, valet. Like Alfred in <i>Batman.</i>

50:36.789 --> 50:39.166
Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.

50:39.333 --> 50:41.919
No shit. I could have used some help.

50:42.086 --> 50:44.547
We were attacked by a Deviant in London, too.

50:44.713 --> 50:46.465
Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

50:47.341 --> 50:48.342
You couldn't?

50:48.509 --> 50:50.511
I was distracted.

50:50.678 --> 50:51.971
Sure, man.

50:52.888 --> 50:55.474
Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?

50:57.768 --> 50:59.353
I'm sorry, Gil.

51:00.020 --> 51:01.397
Ajak's dead.

51:04.233 --> 51:05.526
It's true, buddy.

51:06.068 --> 51:07.403
We lost her.

51:39.393 --> 51:40.561
Sersi.

51:41.979 --> 51:43.856
The attack triggered her.

51:44.023 --> 51:45.941
She's no fun to be around right now.

51:47.526 --> 51:49.028
Hey, Thena.

51:49.445 --> 51:51.322
Look who's here.

51:52.198 --> 51:53.365
Give me your hand.

51:56.118 --> 51:57.161
Thena.

51:57.578 --> 52:00.331
Everyone in Centuri-6 is going to die.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.082
Give me your hand.

52:02.249 --> 52:04.460
It's too late. We can't save them.

52:04.627 --> 52:05.503
Thena.

52:12.551 --> 52:13.802
Thena.

52:14.512 --> 52:17.223
We came to Earth together on our ship.

52:19.517 --> 52:21.227
You're an Eternal.

52:22.061 --> 52:24.813
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

52:24.980 --> 52:27.066
The legendary protector of Athens.

52:28.567 --> 52:30.486
The goddess of war.

52:32.488 --> 52:34.823
Remember who you are.

52:42.873 --> 52:44.333
Remember.

53:00.224 --> 53:02.184
-Thena.
-Hi.

53:03.143 --> 53:04.144
Hello.

53:04.520 --> 53:06.480
Hey, who's your gardener?

53:07.982 --> 53:10.192
This is just what you guys eat every day?

53:10.359 --> 53:11.944
-Yeah, this is amazing.
-Every day.

53:12.111 --> 53:14.196
-Thank you for this.
-Oh, you're welcome.

53:14.363 --> 53:15.531
Help yourself.

53:15.698 --> 53:18.868
This one is a trio of wine, beer, and mead.

53:19.034 --> 53:21.495
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

53:22.162 --> 53:23.747
That's so thoughtful.

53:30.546 --> 53:32.131
Should she be drinking?

53:33.382 --> 53:36.802
No, hers is non-alcoholic. For kids.

53:38.888 --> 53:41.056
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

53:43.684 --> 53:44.685
For kids.

53:46.937 --> 53:48.230
I was just kidding.

53:48.397 --> 53:51.775
Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you...

53:51.942 --> 53:55.070
after we helped defeat Laufey's army
in Tonsberg.

53:55.237 --> 53:56.322
What?

53:57.656 --> 53:58.657
I'm a big baby.

53:58.824 --> 54:00.701
Very mature. Can you stop?

54:01.577 --> 54:02.912
-Stop.
-Speaking of Odin...

54:03.078 --> 54:05.664
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

54:05.831 --> 54:08.459
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

54:08.626 --> 54:10.961
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone...

54:11.128 --> 54:13.088
who do you think is gonna lead the Avengers?

54:13.756 --> 54:15.257
I could lead them.

54:15.424 --> 54:16.634
I figure I'd be good at that.

54:16.800 --> 54:17.635
Yeah, you would.

54:17.968 --> 54:20.012
Ajak didn't even choose you to lead us.

54:20.763 --> 54:22.598
Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

54:22.765 --> 54:23.766
-Harsh.
-I'm gonna let that one slide...

54:23.933 --> 54:26.477
because, you know, you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

54:26.644 --> 54:27.853
So what, you can fly.

54:28.020 --> 54:29.730
I'm better-looking, everybody knows that.

54:29.897 --> 54:30.898
Where you going?

54:32.900 --> 54:34.568
I'm just gonna get some air.

54:40.449 --> 54:41.825
This is really good, Gil.

54:41.992 --> 54:45.204
You know, I could sell this.
Put my face on it, move some units.

54:45.371 --> 54:46.664
I made it from corn.

54:46.830 --> 54:50.668
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

55:04.723 --> 55:07.560
Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

55:07.893 --> 55:09.687
Yeah, it's a planet.

55:10.604 --> 55:14.233
She thinks she used to live there
until it was destroyed.

55:14.400 --> 55:18.070
Always talks about
massive quakes ripping it apart.

55:18.237 --> 55:20.155
Everyone died, including herself.

55:20.573 --> 55:23.242
We had an unprecedented global earthquake
three days ago.

55:23.909 --> 55:25.744
Oh, that's what that was.

55:25.911 --> 55:27.663
I thought I was drunk.

55:28.372 --> 55:30.583
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

55:31.333 --> 55:33.878
I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

55:34.044 --> 55:35.921
I've tried so many times.

55:37.131 --> 55:39.216
Maybe you're trying too hard.

55:40.176 --> 55:42.761
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

56:30.226 --> 56:31.352
Sersi.

56:32.228 --> 56:33.312
Arishem.

56:33.896 --> 56:35.773
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

56:35.940 --> 56:38.359
We think it absorbed her power.

56:38.526 --> 56:41.278
And something unusual is happening to Earth.

56:41.445 --> 56:44.448
It is a side effect of the emergence.

56:45.866 --> 56:47.493
The emergence?

56:48.244 --> 56:52.414
It is time for you to learn
the true purpose of your mission.

56:52.581 --> 56:57.920
You were sent to Earth to
bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

56:59.129 --> 57:03.801
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

57:04.385 --> 57:08.889
I plant Celestial seeds into host planets
across the universe.

57:11.016 --> 57:14.895
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

57:20.276 --> 57:21.902
<i>In order to grow...</i>

57:22.069 --> 57:25.906
<i>Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy
from intelligent life.</i>

57:26.907 --> 57:30.411
<i>The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans...</i>

57:30.578 --> 57:33.247
<i>until the Eternals eliminated them.</i>

57:33.873 --> 57:39.795
<i>Now, the human population of this planet
has reached the required amount.</i>

57:39.962 --> 57:43.007
<i>It is time for the emergence to begin.</i>

58:02.985 --> 58:04.069
But...

58:05.362 --> 58:07.114
everyone on Earth will die.

58:08.782 --> 58:11.869
The end of one life, Sersi...

58:13.245 --> 58:16.040
<i>is the beginning of another.</i>

58:28.886 --> 58:32.765
<i>Our universe
is a constant exchange of energy.</i>

58:33.766 --> 58:37.811
<i>An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.</i>

58:38.729 --> 58:40.981
<i>Celestials use energy...</i>

58:41.148 --> 58:44.235
<i>gathered from host planets to create suns...</i>

58:44.902 --> 58:48.155
<i>generating gravity, heat, and light...</i>

58:48.322 --> 58:50.824
<i>for new galaxies to form.</i>

58:55.829 --> 58:57.456
<i>Without us...</i>

58:57.623 --> 59:00.793
<i>our universe will fall into darkness.</i>

59:03.546 --> 59:05.422
All life will die.

59:06.632 --> 59:08.384
Ajak knew the truth?

59:08.801 --> 59:13.681
She has helped many Celestials
to emerge over millions of years.

59:13.848 --> 59:15.558
So have you.

59:17.935 --> 59:19.812
Earth was my first mission.

59:21.689 --> 59:25.401
I was home, on Olympia.

59:26.777 --> 59:29.196
There is no Olympia.

59:47.298 --> 59:50.342
This is your true home, Sersi.

59:51.385 --> 59:53.095
The World Forge.

59:55.931 --> 01:00:00.186
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.182
Everything dies except us...

01:00:39.475 --> 01:00:41.519
because we were never alive.

01:00:45.731 --> 01:00:47.525
Why don't I remember any of this?

01:00:57.952 --> 01:01:02.581
Because your memories are erased and reset
after each emergence.

01:01:03.707 --> 01:01:05.251
They are stored here.

01:01:07.962 --> 01:01:09.588
Why do you keep them?

01:01:10.256 --> 01:01:13.676
I keep them in order to study the Deviants.

01:01:14.802 --> 01:01:17.388
I created the Deviants, Sersi...

01:01:17.555 --> 01:01:20.474
for the same purpose I created you.

01:01:21.559 --> 01:01:25.396
<i>Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.</i>

01:01:29.108 --> 01:01:32.278
<i>I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them...</i>

01:01:32.444 --> 01:01:34.989
<i>so intelligent life could grow.</i>

01:01:40.536 --> 01:01:43.205
<i>But there was a flaw in their design.</i>

01:01:44.415 --> 01:01:45.749
<i>They evolved.</i>

01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:47.960
<i>Became predators themselves.</i>

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.131
And I lost control of them.

01:01:54.216 --> 01:01:57.219
I built and programmed you, Eternals...

01:01:57.386 --> 01:02:01.223
to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution...

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:03.559
to correct my mistake.

01:02:05.561 --> 01:02:09.982
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place...

01:02:10.149 --> 01:02:12.401
as the Prime Eternal.

01:02:12.985 --> 01:02:14.778
Do not fail me.

01:02:33.255 --> 01:02:35.883
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:39.345
And our past memories are stored somewhere...

01:02:40.137 --> 01:02:41.722
in space?

01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:44.225
And Arishem made the Deviants.

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.811
I'm sorry, Thena.

01:02:47.978 --> 01:02:49.396
You tried to warn us.

01:02:49.563 --> 01:02:53.567
The last time Arishem reset your memories,
something must have gone wrong.

01:02:54.318 --> 01:02:55.361
What do you mean?

01:02:55.528 --> 01:02:58.864
Well, that's what Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

01:02:59.031 --> 01:03:02.535
All this time, Thena was remembering
all the other planets we were sent to...

01:03:02.701 --> 01:03:04.787
and everyone dying during the emergence.

01:03:05.246 --> 01:03:06.705
I thought we were heroes.

01:03:07.373 --> 01:03:08.707
Turns out we're the bad guys.

01:03:08.874 --> 01:03:11.168
We're not the bad guys, okay?

01:03:11.335 --> 01:03:14.213
We've helped the Celestials
expand life across the universe.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:17.550
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

01:03:17.716 --> 01:03:20.636
Every time innocent lives
have been sacrificed for the greater good...

01:03:20.803 --> 01:03:22.847
it turns out to be a mistake.

01:03:23.472 --> 01:03:25.140
We have to stop the emergence.

01:03:25.307 --> 01:03:28.936
Sersi, we have no right
to stop the birth of a Celestial.

01:03:29.103 --> 01:03:31.981
There has to be a way Tiamut can emerge
without destroying the Earth.

01:03:33.065 --> 01:03:36.277
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

01:03:37.111 --> 01:03:39.321
Could Druig control its mind?

01:03:39.488 --> 01:03:41.740
Maybe put it to sleep?

01:03:41.907 --> 01:03:43.033
"Put it to sleep"?

01:03:43.492 --> 01:03:44.618
Are you serious?

01:03:44.785 --> 01:03:47.288
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

01:03:48.622 --> 01:03:50.332
So I could take a vacation to Fiji, you know?

01:03:50.499 --> 01:03:53.210
-We're talking about a Celestial, okay?
-We have to try.

01:03:53.377 --> 01:03:56.714
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

01:03:56.881 --> 01:03:58.215
Right.

01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:03.053
I'm human. I'm a little biased.

01:04:07.558 --> 01:04:08.934
And do what?

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.187
Watch TV?

01:04:11.353 --> 01:04:14.857
When I could be
with the Earth's original superheroes...

01:04:15.024 --> 01:04:17.443
as they try to save the world?

01:04:18.277 --> 01:04:19.486
Fine.

01:04:19.653 --> 01:04:22.198
If you want to, stay.

01:04:22.364 --> 01:04:24.116
Thank you very much, sir.

01:04:25.826 --> 01:04:27.036
Gilgamesh...

01:04:27.203 --> 01:04:28.746
could you please get rid of the saliva beer?

01:04:28.913 --> 01:04:30.206
I thought you liked it, man.

01:04:30.372 --> 01:04:32.374
We need to go. Now.

01:04:33.209 --> 01:04:34.585
Find the others.

01:04:34.919 --> 01:04:36.170
Once we're all together...

01:04:36.337 --> 01:04:39.048
we'll decide what to do about the emergence.

01:05:12.998 --> 01:05:14.583
It's very nice here, sir.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:16.043
Don't be fooled.

01:05:17.169 --> 01:05:19.255
Ignorance is bliss.

01:05:35.229 --> 01:05:36.438
Hello, Sprite.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.156
I missed all of you.

01:05:49.118 --> 01:05:53.038
Please, make yourselves at home.

01:05:57.877 --> 01:06:00.880
You've given me a lot of bad news
in one go, my lady.

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:02.798
Will you help us?

01:06:03.299 --> 01:06:04.300
I am glad that...

01:06:11.432 --> 01:06:12.558
Hey, what's your service?

01:06:13.017 --> 01:06:14.518
I'm not getting any bars.

01:06:16.228 --> 01:06:19.565
Do you all remember this forest?
Beautiful.

01:06:20.733 --> 01:06:22.776
It was the last place we all lived together.

01:06:24.236 --> 01:06:27.198
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now...

01:06:27.364 --> 01:06:30.367
from the outside world and from themselves.

01:06:30.534 --> 01:06:35.247
Your kind, my friend, you will be responsible
for your own extinction one day.

01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:37.333
Don't you think?

01:06:37.791 --> 01:06:40.961
I think we must learn from our mistakes
and do better, sir.

01:06:41.128 --> 01:06:43.005
You must not give up hope.

01:06:45.925 --> 01:06:47.343
Oh, no, you didn't.

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:50.012
Okay, new rule,
no more possessing people's valets.

01:06:50.179 --> 01:06:51.639
Where is your sense of humor, Kingo?

01:06:51.805 --> 01:06:52.806
I'm sorry, sir.

01:06:52.973 --> 01:06:55.184
Don't apologize, it's not your fault.

01:06:55.935 --> 01:06:58.562
You are not a god.
You know that, right?

01:06:58.729 --> 01:07:02.358
How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.

01:07:02.525 --> 01:07:04.109
I've directed some things, too.

01:07:04.276 --> 01:07:05.653
Oh, yeah? Like what?

01:07:06.278 --> 01:07:07.863
Some Internet content.

01:07:08.614 --> 01:07:09.615
How many views?

01:07:09.782 --> 01:07:11.700
I don't do it for the views.

01:07:11.867 --> 01:07:13.661
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

01:07:13.827 --> 01:07:16.121
-We need him.
-Ikaris.

01:07:17.164 --> 01:07:18.249
I missed you.

01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:21.252
Are you gonna charm me or threaten me?

01:07:21.418 --> 01:07:23.462
I mean, there's a third option,
if you prefer that.

01:07:23.629 --> 01:07:26.507
It must be heartbreaking to find out
that you're not Mother's favorite.

01:07:26.674 --> 01:07:28.342
And I'm sure she'd be real proud
of what you've been up to.

01:07:28.509 --> 01:07:29.510
Druig, this is serious.

01:07:29.677 --> 01:07:31.470
I'll tell you what's serious.

01:07:32.388 --> 01:07:36.350
I've just been told I've been sent on
a suicide mission for the past 7,000 years...

01:07:36.517 --> 01:07:39.895
and that my entire existence is a lie.

01:07:43.065 --> 01:07:46.402
So, excuse me for not giving a shit
about your plan right now.

01:07:51.282 --> 01:07:52.700
Druig sucks.

01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:54.493
He does, sir.

01:08:14.971 --> 01:08:16.724
I don't like this place.

01:08:17.183 --> 01:08:20.394
Druig needs to think,
and Sersi wants us to wait, so...

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.770
we wait.

01:08:23.647 --> 01:08:27.484
I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:30.779
Those were the good old days.

01:08:32.656 --> 01:08:35.201
What if I can't fight anymore?

01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:37.912
Of course you can.

01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:40.997
What if I hurt you again?

01:08:41.372 --> 01:08:46.587
Come on. You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.

01:08:51.425 --> 01:08:52.843
Thank you.

01:08:54.303 --> 01:08:55.554
For what?

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:59.642
For always taking care of me.

01:09:02.019 --> 01:09:03.729
I'd do it again.

01:09:06.564 --> 01:09:08.526
On any planet.

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:29.129
I like watching him, too.

01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:30.464
Jeez.

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:33.216
I don't think it's creepy at all.

01:09:35.845 --> 01:09:37.680
Have you read <i>Peter Pan?</i>

01:09:37.846 --> 01:09:40.975
Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter...

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:45.479
Sersi is Wendy, you are Tinker Bell,
for obvious reasons...

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:49.108
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

01:09:49.567 --> 01:09:51.068
What's your point?

01:09:51.527 --> 01:09:54.071
Tinker Bell's always been in love with Peter.

01:09:57.491 --> 01:10:00.703
And it's hard for her
'cause she can never be with him.

01:10:03.622 --> 01:10:05.124
I'm sorry, Sprite.

01:10:07.042 --> 01:10:08.294
Kingo...

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.382
why did Arishem make me this way?

01:10:15.467 --> 01:10:16.927
I don't know.

01:10:24.518 --> 01:10:25.895
I thought you broke it.

01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:27.855
Always bring backups.

01:10:32.985 --> 01:10:34.778
You have a very angry family, sir.

01:10:35.529 --> 01:10:37.406
Yeah, it's a big issue.

01:10:37.573 --> 01:10:40.492
<i>What about King Midas?
Everything he touched turned to gold.</i>

01:10:40.659 --> 01:10:41.660
<i>-Was that you?
</i>-Dane.

01:10:41.827 --> 01:10:43.746
<i>-Confucius? Aristotle?
</i>-Call your uncle.

01:10:43.913 --> 01:10:45.497
<i>What? My uncle? No.</i>

01:10:45.664 --> 01:10:47.833
You've always wanted
to make amends with him, right?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.377
Now is the time. Trust me.

01:10:50.544 --> 01:10:52.129
<i>Sersi, you're so weird.</i>

01:10:52.296 --> 01:10:53.547
Dane? Dane?

01:10:55.966 --> 01:10:57.426
You're breaking up.

01:10:57.593 --> 01:10:58.636
You're breaking up?

01:11:01.347 --> 01:11:02.973
How did he take the news?

01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:05.976
Couldn't bring myself to tell him
it was the end of the world.

01:11:06.143 --> 01:11:08.395
There's nothing he could do.

01:11:08.562 --> 01:11:09.563
Sersi.

01:11:12.942 --> 01:11:14.652
I'm worried about you.

01:11:15.653 --> 01:11:18.614
If Arishem finds out
you're trying to stop the emergence...

01:11:20.574 --> 01:11:23.494
I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:30.543
I'm not afraid.

01:11:31.794 --> 01:11:34.213
This violent cycle has to end.

01:11:38.717 --> 01:11:40.553
Hey, stop worrying about me.

01:11:41.637 --> 01:11:42.972
Old habit.

01:11:50.187 --> 01:11:52.273
Why did you leave?

01:11:54.066 --> 01:11:55.192
I told myself...

01:11:56.068 --> 01:11:58.070
something must have happened to you.

01:11:58.237 --> 01:12:00.239
So, I waited.

01:12:00.406 --> 01:12:02.867
Days became years...

01:12:03.033 --> 01:12:05.244
and you never came back.

01:12:07.121 --> 01:12:08.706
Sersi...

01:12:09.456 --> 01:12:11.292
I've missed you.

01:12:13.961 --> 01:12:15.963
I didn't want to leave.

01:12:19.049 --> 01:12:20.259
There's something I have to tell...

01:12:20.885 --> 01:12:22.094
Ikaris!

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.929
Ikaris!

01:12:33.105 --> 01:12:34.607
Watch out!

01:12:34.773 --> 01:12:36.358
Clear the camp!

01:12:39.403 --> 01:12:40.738
Get behind me!

01:12:40.905 --> 01:12:41.906
One of them took Ikaris.

01:12:42.072 --> 01:12:43.240
It's an ambush!

01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:54.210
Very nice, sir!

01:12:54.543 --> 01:12:56.086
<i>Are you mental? Hide!</i>

01:12:56.253 --> 01:12:58.631
We need action sequences.

01:12:59.256 --> 01:13:00.466
Sir!

01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:02.843
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

01:13:05.095 --> 01:13:07.973
How many cameras did you bring, young man?

01:13:15.814 --> 01:13:17.233
Kingo!

01:13:17.399 --> 01:13:18.817
Come on!

01:13:25.533 --> 01:13:26.742
This way!

01:13:26.909 --> 01:13:28.077
Quickly! Come on!

01:13:33.207 --> 01:13:34.959
Get in! Get in!

01:14:12.913 --> 01:14:13.747
Ikaris!

01:14:29.346 --> 01:14:33.142
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:37.479
No.

01:14:39.523 --> 01:14:40.858
Terrible timing, Thena.

01:14:41.609 --> 01:14:42.693
Thena!

01:14:51.202 --> 01:14:52.453
Stop, Thena!

01:15:27.905 --> 01:15:29.031
Let them go.

01:15:29.198 --> 01:15:30.741
Now is not the time, Sersi.

01:15:30.908 --> 01:15:34.078
Please. I know you're better than this.

01:15:43.337 --> 01:15:44.463
Druig.

01:15:45.673 --> 01:15:47.675
Go! Get to the river!

01:16:05.234 --> 01:16:06.652
Gilgamesh.

01:16:07.319 --> 01:16:09.029
A little help here?

01:16:09.196 --> 01:16:10.322
Stay here.

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.991
Say it.

01:16:13.409 --> 01:16:14.410
Stay here.

01:16:14.577 --> 01:16:16.662
Good. You're okay.

01:16:28.549 --> 01:16:29.884
They're headed for the camp.

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:31.760
Go. They need you.

01:16:31.927 --> 01:16:33.345
Go, Ikaris.

01:16:41.353 --> 01:16:43.480
Sprite, buy me some time!

01:16:52.781 --> 01:16:54.575
Can you hurry up?

01:16:56.702 --> 01:16:57.620
Now!

01:17:02.416 --> 01:17:03.459
Dishoom.

01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:15.012
Karun! Did you get that?

01:17:15.179 --> 01:17:16.931
I did, sir!

01:17:52.007 --> 01:17:53.759
-Kingo!
-Just go.

01:17:53.926 --> 01:17:55.386
I'm not leaving you.

01:17:55.719 --> 01:17:56.762
Sprite!

01:18:31.463 --> 01:18:32.464
Ikaris!

01:19:15.132 --> 01:19:17.551
Sersi! Are you all right?

01:19:28.103 --> 01:19:29.813
How did you do that?

01:19:30.648 --> 01:19:32.399
I don't know.

01:19:45.538 --> 01:19:47.289
Stop, stop, stop.

01:19:49.208 --> 01:19:50.167
Thena.

01:20:33.043 --> 01:20:35.337
No. Gilgamesh.

01:20:35.838 --> 01:20:37.131
Stay back.

01:20:45.389 --> 01:20:46.807
Ajak...

01:20:48.434 --> 01:20:49.852
Her memories...

01:20:51.937 --> 01:20:53.939
I understand now.

01:20:55.065 --> 01:20:57.359
I can see what she saw.

01:20:58.611 --> 01:21:00.654
So many planets.

01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:07.036
So much life destroyed
every time a Celestial is born.

01:21:07.745 --> 01:21:09.622
Arishem used us...

01:21:09.788 --> 01:21:14.251
and left us to die with each emergence.

01:21:14.418 --> 01:21:16.045
We just wanted to survive.

01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:20.633
And then he sent you.

01:21:21.926 --> 01:21:26.096
I will kill you all
for what you have done to my kind.

01:21:26.263 --> 01:21:29.058
You are not saviors, Eternals.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.268
You are murderers.

01:21:34.939 --> 01:21:35.856
Ikaris!

01:21:50.913 --> 01:21:52.289
Thena.

01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:56.544
Hey.

01:21:58.504 --> 01:22:00.047
Remember.

01:22:08.347 --> 01:22:09.807
No.

01:22:11.684 --> 01:22:12.977
No.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.898
I'll remember.

01:22:18.065 --> 01:22:19.608
I'll remember.

01:22:42.548 --> 01:22:44.717
I'll remember.

01:23:27.134 --> 01:23:28.719
When I left...

01:23:28.886 --> 01:23:34.058
I thought about taking over the minds
of every human on this planet.

01:23:34.934 --> 01:23:38.270
Violence, fear, greed...

01:23:38.437 --> 01:23:39.980
all gone.

01:23:40.147 --> 01:23:41.315
Why didn't you?

01:23:41.482 --> 01:23:44.068
Because without their flaws...

01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:46.529
they wouldn't be human.

01:23:49.532 --> 01:23:52.535
Please, Druig. You can't stay here anymore.

01:23:53.285 --> 01:23:56.747
These Deviants are trying to keep us
from killing their own kind.

01:23:56.914 --> 01:23:59.750
They have a conscience now.
That makes them more dangerous.

01:23:59.917 --> 01:24:01.836
No, Sersi.

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.339
That makes them us.

01:24:06.048 --> 01:24:08.008
Eternals and Deviants.

01:24:09.218 --> 01:24:10.845
Arishem's children.

01:24:12.012 --> 01:24:15.766
But you are asking me to take control
of a mind of a Celestial.

01:24:15.933 --> 01:24:19.186
I do not have that kind of power.

01:24:19.353 --> 01:24:21.063
We'll need Phastos.

01:24:23.607 --> 01:24:25.025
Well, good luck.

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.779
He gave up on humans a long time ago.

01:25:01.437 --> 01:25:02.730
I did this.

01:25:04.648 --> 01:25:06.984
If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

01:25:12.406 --> 01:25:14.283
Druig was right.

01:25:15.159 --> 01:25:17.244
Our mission was a mistake.

01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:19.455
These people...

01:25:21.248 --> 01:25:22.499
they're not worth saving.

01:25:22.666 --> 01:25:24.502
Oh, Phastos.

01:25:24.668 --> 01:25:26.128
They're not worth saving.

01:25:38.307 --> 01:25:40.059
-Thanks.
-Give me a good one.

01:25:40.226 --> 01:25:41.602
-All right.
-Over here.

01:25:41.769 --> 01:25:42.686
And...

01:25:43.354 --> 01:25:44.396
-Oh, that's great, man!
-Yeah!

01:25:44.563 --> 01:25:45.689
-Yeah!
-Oh, yeah!

01:25:45.856 --> 01:25:47.525
-Nice.
-Good one. All right, ready? Throw!

01:25:48.817 --> 01:25:49.652
So close.

01:25:49.818 --> 01:25:50.903
-Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
-Yeah, okay.

01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:53.030
-Watch this.
-Let me see. Let me see it.

01:25:54.198 --> 01:25:55.741
Dad. I'm only a starter.

01:25:55.908 --> 01:25:56.909
Hi.

01:25:57.076 --> 01:25:58.369
Hello. Can we help you?

01:25:58.536 --> 01:25:59.453
Throw it again.

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:02.206
Hey, Jack. Ben.

01:26:03.415 --> 01:26:06.794
Hey, guys.
These are my friends from college.

01:26:09.129 --> 01:26:14.176
This is Sylvia and Isaac.
That's Isaac.

01:26:14.635 --> 01:26:16.679
-Isaac.
-Dad, that's Superman.

01:26:16.846 --> 01:26:19.265
-Dad, that's Superman!
-Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

01:26:19.431 --> 01:26:21.392
-No, no! He is Superman.
-That is definitely not Superman.

01:26:21.559 --> 01:26:25.479
I saw him on TV.
He was in London, fighting a monster.

01:26:26.105 --> 01:26:29.525
And you were with a cape and you were
shooting laser beams out of your eyes.

01:26:30.234 --> 01:26:31.235
I don't wear a cape.

01:26:31.402 --> 01:26:33.654
-Oh, sorry.
-Okay, well, we should just go inside, right?

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:36.323
Can I call you Clark? Is that what you
go by now? Because, you know...

01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:38.117
You've called me worse.

01:26:38.284 --> 01:26:39.827
You got it, Jack?

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:41.078
Way to go.

01:26:41.245 --> 01:26:43.289
-Yes.
-All right. Show me how it's done.

01:26:43.664 --> 01:26:46.250
Round and round and round
and round and round.

01:26:49.753 --> 01:26:51.463
-Yep, you got it. Keep going.
-Come on.

01:27:00.222 --> 01:27:03.184
Yeah. Incredibly natural, guys.

01:27:05.936 --> 01:27:08.022
So, after all these years...

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:10.274
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

01:27:10.441 --> 01:27:11.942
No need to rub it in.

01:27:13.944 --> 01:27:17.990
It all makes sense why she wouldn't let us
interfere with human conflicts.

01:27:18.532 --> 01:27:20.201
Conflicts lead to war...

01:27:20.367 --> 01:27:24.955
and war actually leads to advancement
in lifesaving technology and medicine.

01:27:25.122 --> 01:27:27.124
So our mission was never to...

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:30.044
make a peaceful or harmonious world...

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:33.964
but to increase the population at all costs.

01:27:34.131 --> 01:27:37.176
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

01:27:37.343 --> 01:27:38.344
That's bleak.

01:27:38.511 --> 01:27:40.012
Well, so is telling
your husband and your child...

01:27:40.179 --> 01:27:41.764
that they could be dead within a few days.

01:27:41.931 --> 01:27:44.016
Thought you'd given up on humans.

01:27:44.767 --> 01:27:46.727
I got lucky. Okay?

01:27:48.979 --> 01:27:51.023
I have a family now.

01:27:51.190 --> 01:27:53.526
They've given me faith again.

01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:58.697
And I see the good in humanity in them
every single day.

01:27:58.864 --> 01:28:00.491
So, look, I cannot help you.

01:28:00.658 --> 01:28:01.784
-I am never leaving them.
-Phastos...

01:28:01.951 --> 01:28:03.035
I'm sorry, Sersi.

01:28:03.202 --> 01:28:04.578
It was wrong for me to use my powers...

01:28:04.745 --> 01:28:06.664
without thinking about the consequences
in the first place.

01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:11.585
So, now, I choose to use my hands
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?

01:28:12.127 --> 01:28:13.337
Do you?

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:15.589
I don't use my powers anymore.

01:28:15.756 --> 01:28:17.091
You sure?

01:28:17.258 --> 01:28:18.092
What are you...

01:28:21.679 --> 01:28:25.015
What the hell is wrong with you?
My child is right down the hallway!

01:28:25.182 --> 01:28:27.184
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:29.562
-Oh, my God.
-I bet you've built the perfect safe house.

01:28:29.728 --> 01:28:31.272
What is this even made of? Vibranium?

01:28:31.438 --> 01:28:32.356
Don't!

01:28:36.569 --> 01:28:38.070
Fall collection.

01:28:38.237 --> 01:28:39.488
IKEA.

01:28:39.655 --> 01:28:40.656
Ass.

01:28:40.823 --> 01:28:43.534
How did you even deal with this guy
for over 5,000 years?

01:28:43.701 --> 01:28:46.287
If you stay here, you might as well
invite the Deviants to dinner.

01:28:46.453 --> 01:28:47.997
Never mind waiting for the end of the world.

01:28:48.163 --> 01:28:49.415
He has a point.

01:28:49.582 --> 01:28:52.585
No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up
in my life and expect me to go with you.

01:28:52.751 --> 01:28:54.753
-I'm not gonna...
-You should go, <i>habibi.</i>

01:28:55.546 --> 01:28:56.839
You want me to go?

01:28:57.006 --> 01:28:59.800
You know what my mom would say to you
right now, right?

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:05.472
He's a chronic procrastinator.

01:29:05.639 --> 01:29:07.600
I'm not leaving you two. No way.

01:29:07.766 --> 01:29:09.560
I'm not happy about it...

01:29:10.227 --> 01:29:13.480
but if there's a chance for us to watch Jack
grow up to live a life of his own...

01:29:13.647 --> 01:29:15.357
we should take it.

01:30:43.696 --> 01:30:45.531
The <i>Domo.</i>

01:30:46.699 --> 01:30:48.200
Wow.

01:30:58.043 --> 01:31:01.130
<i>A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.</i>

01:31:01.964 --> 01:31:04.842
<i>An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.</i>

01:31:05.009 --> 01:31:07.595
<i>What are you doing? You know you're
creeping us out. You know that, right?</i>

01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:10.681
<i>Oh, God! Stay calm, T, please!</i>

01:31:14.476 --> 01:31:16.854
<i>Chips. It's just chips.</i>

01:31:17.271 --> 01:31:21.442
<i>As you can see, being an Eternal does not
preclude you from having human emotions...</i>

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:23.402
<i>such as cowardice.</i>

01:31:25.905 --> 01:31:27.489
What has she done?

01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:31.327
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.873
This is Makkari.
Or should I say Miss Havisham?

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.750
None of us have seen her for centuries.

01:32:01.690 --> 01:32:02.733
Is that the Ebony Blade?

01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:04.151
Excalibur.

01:32:05.694 --> 01:32:07.279
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

01:32:18.374 --> 01:32:21.544
That, and the world is ending.

01:32:26.048 --> 01:32:27.299
Have you seen my movies?

01:32:31.095 --> 01:32:32.096
DVD?

01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:34.014
It's all about streaming now.

01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:36.100
You know, what you need is a Kindle.

01:32:36.267 --> 01:32:38.310
Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

01:32:38.936 --> 01:32:41.730
You know, I just realized
that if you don't know what an iPad is...

01:32:41.897 --> 01:32:44.024
there's almost no way to explain it.

01:32:48.237 --> 01:32:52.575
So, how did you end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet...

01:32:52.741 --> 01:32:55.661
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

01:32:58.747 --> 01:33:00.124
Did you miss me?

01:33:01.333 --> 01:33:02.877
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this...

01:33:03.043 --> 01:33:05.129
-Is this new? Because I hate it.
-Are you two...

01:33:05.296 --> 01:33:08.257
Phastos, I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

01:33:08.424 --> 01:33:09.884
Okay, get ready for it.

01:33:13.179 --> 01:33:14.305
Bracelets?

01:33:14.805 --> 01:33:15.890
You made us bracelets?

01:33:16.056 --> 01:33:17.975
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

01:33:18.142 --> 01:33:21.812
Celestials are the most powerful
energy generators in the universe.

01:33:21.979 --> 01:33:25.232
When Arishem made us,
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy...

01:33:25.441 --> 01:33:28.569
to keep our bodies regenerating.
The bracelets, in theory...

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:30.696
shut down our regeneration process.

01:33:30.863 --> 01:33:33.949
And once that happens,
our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy.

01:33:34.283 --> 01:33:35.284
What for?

01:33:35.451 --> 01:33:38.245
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy...

01:33:38.787 --> 01:33:42.082
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

01:33:42.249 --> 01:33:44.752
If I can find a way to connect us all...

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:46.879
one of us could become immensely powerful...

01:33:47.046 --> 01:33:49.757
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest...

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:51.091
forming...

01:33:54.678 --> 01:33:56.055
a Uni-Mind.

01:33:59.808 --> 01:34:01.769
"Uni" meaning "one," "mind" meaning "mind."

01:34:01.936 --> 01:34:02.937
Oh, no, we heard you the first time.

01:34:03.103 --> 01:34:04.396
-Terrible name.
-We'll brainstorm...

01:34:05.064 --> 01:34:06.065
"Brainstorm"!

01:34:06.232 --> 01:34:07.733
-That's a way better name!
-No, I invented it...

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:08.901
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

01:34:14.865 --> 01:34:17.284
We find humans a new home on another planet.

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:20.287
Are we building a big ship, too?
Take a pair of each animal?

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:22.831
Well, you know what's never saved the planet?
Your sarcasm.

01:34:22.998 --> 01:34:24.834
Space colonization could take decades.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.377
It can happen quickly with our help.

01:34:26.544 --> 01:34:28.963
What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?

01:34:29.129 --> 01:34:32.883
We could be responsible for billions of lives
not being created across the universe.

01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:34.385
Boss, am I right?

01:34:36.053 --> 01:34:37.805
Say something, Ikaris.

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:39.640
You don't think we should be doing this.

01:34:46.397 --> 01:34:48.774
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

01:34:50.234 --> 01:34:52.111
Sersi should decide.

01:34:54.738 --> 01:34:56.532
Forget who Ajak chose.

01:34:56.699 --> 01:34:59.869
You're the strongest.
You should be making this decision.

01:35:00.953 --> 01:35:03.247
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

01:35:03.414 --> 01:35:04.790
Sprite.

01:35:13.924 --> 01:35:15.176
Okay, this is not...

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:16.635
-Ikaris.
-Don't run after him.

01:35:16.802 --> 01:35:18.804
Kingo, I...
You guys.

01:35:19.221 --> 01:35:21.682
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:23.726
I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.

01:35:23.893 --> 01:35:25.227
I'm okay, Kingo.

01:35:25.394 --> 01:35:27.104
If you think we should do this, I trust you.

01:35:27.271 --> 01:35:29.940
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

01:35:31.942 --> 01:35:33.444
What did you say?

01:35:33.694 --> 01:35:36.155
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

01:35:37.907 --> 01:35:40.784
I'm not who you think I am.

01:36:19.114 --> 01:36:20.741
How long do we have?

01:36:21.158 --> 01:36:22.743
Seven days.

01:36:23.285 --> 01:36:24.578
Good.

01:36:26.163 --> 01:36:28.165
We completed our mission.

01:36:31.001 --> 01:36:32.545
Where is she?

01:36:32.711 --> 01:36:33.712
London.

01:36:34.547 --> 01:36:36.131
She has a good life there.

01:36:36.298 --> 01:36:38.384
I'm sure she's missed you.

01:36:38.551 --> 01:36:41.846
If I'd gone back to her,
I would only have told her the truth.

01:36:43.681 --> 01:36:45.307
She would've suffered...

01:36:45.474 --> 01:36:47.977
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

01:36:48.143 --> 01:36:49.311
Ikaris.

01:36:50.354 --> 01:36:52.022
We have to tell them the truth.

01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:53.607
What?

01:36:53.983 --> 01:36:55.526
-Why?
-Because together...

01:36:55.693 --> 01:36:57.778
we might be able to stop the emergence.

01:36:58.529 --> 01:37:00.197
"Stop the emergence"?

01:37:00.364 --> 01:37:01.365
Listen...

01:37:01.532 --> 01:37:03.367
-Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...
-Listen to me, Ikaris.

01:37:03.534 --> 01:37:06.579
I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

01:37:06.745 --> 01:37:09.373
And I have never doubted him.

01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:11.208
-Until now.
-Why now?

01:37:12.168 --> 01:37:13.544
Why now?

01:37:18.424 --> 01:37:23.053
Five years ago, Thanos erased
half of the population of the universe.

01:37:24.513 --> 01:37:26.348
Delayed the emergence.

01:37:28.392 --> 01:37:30.352
But the people of this planet...

01:37:30.519 --> 01:37:33.772
brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:38.110
You know, after I let you all go...

01:37:38.277 --> 01:37:41.155
I traveled the world, living among them.

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:44.909
I have seen them fight and lie and kill...

01:37:45.201 --> 01:37:47.536
but I have also seen them...

01:37:47.703 --> 01:37:50.122
laugh and love.

01:37:50.289 --> 01:37:54.293
I've seen them create and dream.

01:37:57.505 --> 01:37:58.881
This planet...

01:37:59.548 --> 01:38:01.133
and these people...

01:38:02.593 --> 01:38:04.261
have changed me.

01:38:05.846 --> 01:38:09.892
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

01:38:10.059 --> 01:38:11.685
Not this time.

01:38:13.521 --> 01:38:15.231
I trust you, Ajak.

01:38:19.485 --> 01:38:21.320
I'll follow you to the end...

01:38:22.655 --> 01:38:24.156
as I always have.

01:38:24.323 --> 01:38:25.699
Thank you.

01:38:27.326 --> 01:38:29.286
We have to bring everyone back together.

01:38:31.914 --> 01:38:34.250
There's something I have to show you first.

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:46.554
It's just up ahead.

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:56.564
They must have been trapped in the ice
for centuries...

01:38:56.730 --> 01:38:59.650
and broke free last week
when the glacier started to melt...

01:38:59.817 --> 01:39:02.528
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:06.073
They killed an entire company of oil workers.

01:39:06.866 --> 01:39:08.492
I tracked them here.

01:39:11.996 --> 01:39:14.331
I suspected you might have changed your mind.

01:39:15.499 --> 01:39:17.543
I can't let you betray Arishem.

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:21.338
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

01:39:21.505 --> 01:39:24.508
When the others realize
something is happening to the Earth...

01:39:25.176 --> 01:39:26.343
they'll come to you.

01:39:27.052 --> 01:39:29.930
When they find your body,
they'll know the Deviants are back.

01:39:30.347 --> 01:39:33.017
It'll keep them busy until the emergence.

01:39:34.727 --> 01:39:37.062
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

01:39:37.396 --> 01:39:39.857
Kept your secret for centuries...

01:39:40.191 --> 01:39:42.943
lied to everyone I cared about...

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:47.740
but never have I doubted my purpose
to serve the Celestials.

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:50.367
Oh, Ikaris.

01:39:55.247 --> 01:39:58.125
I've led you down the wrong path.

01:39:58.918 --> 01:40:00.336
It's the only path I know.

01:42:54.093 --> 01:42:56.053
Thought I'd find you here.

01:42:56.554 --> 01:42:58.973
I've thought about this place a lot.

01:43:00.182 --> 01:43:02.518
Amazing how things change over time.

01:43:03.102 --> 01:43:05.229
Maybe we're the ones who've changed.

01:43:08.065 --> 01:43:09.942
I know you don't agree with our plan.

01:43:11.068 --> 01:43:14.071
I've always thought of the Celestials
like the ocean.

01:43:15.906 --> 01:43:19.410
They give life
and they take life away without bias.

01:43:19.827 --> 01:43:22.538
If they were gone,
this universe would eventually end.

01:43:23.038 --> 01:43:25.457
What you're trying to do is free humanity
from the natural order.

01:43:25.624 --> 01:43:29.461
It's not natural to allow all life
on an entire planet to be destroyed.

01:43:30.171 --> 01:43:31.922
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

01:43:32.089 --> 01:43:34.049
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

01:43:34.842 --> 01:43:35.843
It'll all end soon.

01:43:36.010 --> 01:43:38.846
Except there is no end, is there?

01:43:39.096 --> 01:43:41.599
We'd carry on without our memories...

01:43:41.765 --> 01:43:43.309
or free will...

01:43:43.475 --> 01:43:45.060
for eternity.

01:43:50.774 --> 01:43:52.151
You're afraid.

01:43:52.568 --> 01:43:55.196
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

01:43:55.905 --> 01:43:57.865
I only wish that when we do...

01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:01.702
I would be able to remember you.

01:44:03.787 --> 01:44:06.248
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:09.627
I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

01:44:15.799 --> 01:44:16.884
Ikaris.

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:43.035
Sersi?

01:44:47.039 --> 01:44:48.499
It's started.

01:44:51.961 --> 01:44:53.629
Oh, no. My God.

01:44:54.213 --> 01:44:55.214
What about the Uni-Mind?

01:44:55.673 --> 01:44:58.425
I haven't figured out a way to connect us,
but I'm close.

01:44:58.592 --> 01:45:00.135
-I'm very, very close.
-How much longer?

01:45:00.302 --> 01:45:02.304
I don't know, Sersi!

01:45:05.516 --> 01:45:06.851
Find the point of emergence.

01:45:30.749 --> 01:45:33.335
You always knew the end was coming.

01:45:33.502 --> 01:45:36.130
It must be a relief.

01:45:36.297 --> 01:45:38.299
That Deviant is still tracking us.

01:45:39.008 --> 01:45:41.552
Revenge won't bring peace for you, Thena.

01:45:42.052 --> 01:45:44.263
But killing it might.

01:45:57.359 --> 01:45:58.777
Ikaris?

01:46:00.196 --> 01:46:01.655
What are you doing?

01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:10.247
I wanted you to leave this world in peace.

01:46:11.624 --> 01:46:14.043
Without knowing about the emergence.

01:46:14.418 --> 01:46:16.003
But I failed.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.550
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

01:46:28.766 --> 01:46:30.100
I'm close to figuring it out.

01:46:34.605 --> 01:46:35.898
Boss, what are you doing?

01:46:36.065 --> 01:46:37.566
I've let this go on long enough.

01:46:37.733 --> 01:46:38.651
Don't hurt him!

01:46:40.778 --> 01:46:42.363
He lied to us.

01:46:43.239 --> 01:46:44.990
He already knew about the emergence.

01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:47.034
No, he didn't.

01:46:47.201 --> 01:46:49.912
Ajak told me everything when we left Babylon.

01:46:51.288 --> 01:46:52.289
What?

01:46:53.290 --> 01:46:55.668
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

01:46:55.835 --> 01:46:56.836
No.

01:46:58.128 --> 01:47:00.798
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

01:47:00.965 --> 01:47:04.260
If Ajak wanted you to take her place,
why did she choose me?

01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:10.641
What have you done?

01:47:11.976 --> 01:47:13.602
He killed her.

01:47:16.355 --> 01:47:17.356
I had to.

01:47:18.774 --> 01:47:20.651
She loved you.

01:47:23.445 --> 01:47:25.114
-Did she?
-She loved you.

01:47:27.491 --> 01:47:29.827
Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

01:47:30.828 --> 01:47:32.830
To know that one day all this would end?

01:47:34.957 --> 01:47:37.334
To keep on lying to you?

01:47:38.794 --> 01:47:40.880
If we gave humanity the choice...

01:47:41.046 --> 01:47:46.135
how many of them would be willing to die
so that billions more could be born?

01:47:46.302 --> 01:47:48.679
We're not giving them a choice.

01:47:49.471 --> 01:47:52.808
Is this why you're willing to kill?

01:47:53.809 --> 01:47:56.478
You are so pathetic!

01:47:56.896 --> 01:47:59.190
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

01:47:59.815 --> 01:48:02.860
I exist for Arishem.

01:48:03.027 --> 01:48:04.278
As do you.

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:05.779
It's who you are.

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:10.618
I wouldn't change a single thing
about who I am.

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:12.745
Born or made.

01:48:12.912 --> 01:48:15.164
But I do not exist for Arishem...

01:48:15.331 --> 01:48:17.291
I exist for my family!

01:48:17.458 --> 01:48:19.919
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:24.173
-No!
-Makkari!

01:48:26.509 --> 01:48:27.968
Get out of here!

01:48:31.013 --> 01:48:32.389
Kingo.

01:48:40.314 --> 01:48:42.900
You do not turn against your family.

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:46.195
Gilgamesh died because of you.

01:48:48.113 --> 01:48:49.573
You won't succeed against me.

01:48:50.574 --> 01:48:53.160
And I will kill every one of you
if I have to.

01:49:00.918 --> 01:49:02.044
Wait.

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:04.046
I'm going with you.

01:49:04.213 --> 01:49:05.256
Sprite...

01:49:07.049 --> 01:49:08.092
What is this?

01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:27.444
Because she loves him.

01:49:29.238 --> 01:49:31.699
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

01:49:32.867 --> 01:49:35.035
He really fooled us, didn't he?

01:49:35.911 --> 01:49:37.204
Karun, let's go.

01:49:37.746 --> 01:49:38.956
Wait, where the hell are you going?

01:49:39.123 --> 01:49:41.041
I can't help you guys.

01:49:42.084 --> 01:49:43.711
I still think Ikaris is right.

01:49:43.878 --> 01:49:46.922
So, that's it, huh? Just gonna follow him?

01:49:47.715 --> 01:49:49.717
I love the people of this planet.

01:49:50.176 --> 01:49:52.469
But if you stop this emergence...

01:49:52.636 --> 01:49:55.014
you are preventing
so many other worlds like this one...

01:49:55.181 --> 01:49:56.765
from being created.

01:49:57.474 --> 01:49:59.310
I still have faith in Arishem.

01:49:59.768 --> 01:50:02.938
But I refuse to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

01:50:08.903 --> 01:50:11.488
Even with my help, we're no match.

01:50:12.239 --> 01:50:13.908
It's Ikaris.

01:50:17.286 --> 01:50:18.287
But...

01:50:19.079 --> 01:50:20.956
I hope to see you on the next planet.

01:50:48.609 --> 01:50:49.610
Look...

01:50:50.319 --> 01:50:53.322
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris...

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:55.991
we'll need to have a backup plan.

01:50:56.158 --> 01:50:57.868
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified...

01:50:58.035 --> 01:50:59.411
are not enough to kill a Celestial, so...

01:50:59.578 --> 01:51:02.122
Well, Sersi did turn a Deviant into a tree.

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:04.250
I'm sorry, what?

01:51:04.917 --> 01:51:06.377
You didn't wanna tell me that?

01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:09.839
I don't know how it happened, okay?

01:51:10.005 --> 01:51:12.424
And I'm pretty sure I couldn't do it again.

01:51:12.591 --> 01:51:15.135
Well, now is the time to try,
don't you think?

01:51:15.302 --> 01:51:17.263
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

01:51:17.429 --> 01:51:20.641
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep,
not to kill it.

01:51:20.808 --> 01:51:22.184
I can't kill a Celestial.

01:51:22.351 --> 01:51:23.978
Sersi. Sersi.

01:51:24.144 --> 01:51:25.521
We can't!

01:51:31.485 --> 01:51:32.611
We can't.

01:51:32.778 --> 01:51:34.321
It's okay, Sersi.

01:51:35.656 --> 01:51:37.032
I got this.

01:51:53.257 --> 01:51:54.884
There's no time for that.

01:51:56.051 --> 01:51:58.762
I didn't see the lies right in front of me.

01:52:00.055 --> 01:52:02.933
I'm not even sure why Ajak chose me to lead.

01:52:04.476 --> 01:52:06.020
I asked Gilgamesh once...

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.856
why he chose to protect me.

01:52:09.273 --> 01:52:10.691
He said...

01:52:11.150 --> 01:52:14.486
"When you love something, you protect it.

01:52:15.196 --> 01:52:19.825
"It is the most natural thing in the world."

01:52:22.494 --> 01:52:27.041
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

01:52:28.459 --> 01:52:33.881
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

01:52:36.383 --> 01:52:37.676
Sersi.

01:52:39.929 --> 01:52:41.263
Get up.

01:52:49.188 --> 01:52:51.649
Ajak chose you for a reason.

01:52:56.904 --> 01:52:57.863
Sersi!

01:52:58.322 --> 01:52:59.365
Sersi!

01:52:59.532 --> 01:53:01.116
Sersi. We need you!

01:53:01.283 --> 01:53:02.826
I already gave that speech.

01:53:02.993 --> 01:53:04.036
What?

01:53:04.203 --> 01:53:05.454
You did... What...

01:53:05.621 --> 01:53:08.624
Sersi, the sphere inside of you...

01:53:08.791 --> 01:53:10.334
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

01:53:10.501 --> 01:53:13.629
Maybe I can repurpose it...

01:53:13.796 --> 01:53:16.048
and create a connection between...

01:53:16.549 --> 01:53:17.550
well, all of us.

01:53:18.008 --> 01:53:20.302
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

01:53:20.469 --> 01:53:22.137
-Great.
-Yeah.

01:53:22.847 --> 01:53:24.098
But...

01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:26.976
I have to take it out of you.

01:53:29.895 --> 01:53:31.105
Okay.

01:53:32.606 --> 01:53:33.691
Do it.

01:53:35.317 --> 01:53:36.443
Okay.

01:53:44.451 --> 01:53:46.036
Don't kill her.

01:53:46.203 --> 01:53:47.413
Thena...

01:53:48.664 --> 01:53:49.707
Do it.

01:54:03.387 --> 01:54:04.680
Will it work?

01:54:09.393 --> 01:54:10.811
It has to.

01:55:02.613 --> 01:55:04.406
I'm glad you're here.

01:55:08.619 --> 01:55:10.204
Thank you, Sprite.

01:55:25.052 --> 01:55:26.720
Protect the emergence.

01:55:26.887 --> 01:55:28.639
You're really gonna kill them?

01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.023
Where's Druig?

01:55:38.566 --> 01:55:39.775
He's busy.

01:55:39.942 --> 01:55:42.027
Thena, play nice.

01:55:45.823 --> 01:55:47.241
You've never had to fight me.

01:55:47.408 --> 01:55:48.534
But I've always wanted to.

01:55:56.959 --> 01:55:59.170
It's time to put a god to sleep.

01:57:06.612 --> 01:57:08.447
I should've done this five centuries ago.

01:57:55.786 --> 01:57:57.288
Druig's gone.

01:57:58.205 --> 01:57:59.582
It's over.

01:59:07.107 --> 01:59:07.942
Phastos.

01:59:12.363 --> 01:59:14.156
I have to try and stop this.

01:59:14.323 --> 01:59:16.075
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

01:59:16.242 --> 01:59:18.035
-Keep Ikaris busy.
-We've got you.

01:59:18.202 --> 01:59:19.203
Go.

01:59:28.045 --> 01:59:28.963
Enough.

01:59:59.159 --> 02:00:00.411
Thena, stop!

02:00:32.526 --> 02:00:33.903
Why are you helping Ikaris?

02:00:34.778 --> 02:00:36.155
We can't let it absorb our powers.

02:00:37.489 --> 02:00:38.616
Too late.

02:00:40.284 --> 02:00:42.912
Thena, he's trying to goad you. Don't...

02:00:58.802 --> 02:00:59.803
Makkari!

02:01:08.979 --> 02:01:10.189
Where's Sersi?

02:01:10.564 --> 02:01:12.733
You always did underestimate her.

02:01:14.193 --> 02:01:15.444
Oh, no.

02:01:16.278 --> 02:01:17.905
Not so fast.

02:01:22.368 --> 02:01:23.744
Boss.

02:01:27.915 --> 02:01:30.793
I don't know about you,
but this is really satisfying, right?

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:33.295
Let me go, Phastos! I can't let her do this!

02:01:33.462 --> 02:01:34.755
I don't think so.

02:01:35.172 --> 02:01:38.634
I've been wanting to clip your wings
for a long time, Ikaris!

02:01:51.939 --> 02:01:52.940
Thena.

02:01:55.651 --> 02:01:58.571
Oh, you've changed.

02:01:59.947 --> 02:02:01.574
You're broken.

02:02:02.408 --> 02:02:03.909
Damaged.

02:02:04.493 --> 02:02:06.328
Useless.

02:02:08.581 --> 02:02:12.418
You can't protect any of them.

02:02:26.348 --> 02:02:27.725
Sersi.

02:02:32.479 --> 02:02:35.399
You're not powerful enough to do this.

02:02:35.566 --> 02:02:37.484
And you won't.

02:02:37.902 --> 02:02:39.653
You're not a killer.

02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:41.405
Maybe I've changed.

02:02:41.864 --> 02:02:44.366
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

02:02:44.533 --> 02:02:47.161
Are you really willing
to let everyone on this planet die?

02:02:55.961 --> 02:02:57.755
I'm sorry, Sersi.

02:03:10.226 --> 02:03:12.436
I've always envied you, Sersi.

02:03:14.522 --> 02:03:16.565
'Cause you get to live as one of them.

02:03:17.107 --> 02:03:18.192
And I never could.

02:03:19.443 --> 02:03:21.695
You know why I hated living with humans?

02:03:22.279 --> 02:03:25.074
Because they reminded me of
things I didn't even know I wanted.

02:03:25.574 --> 02:03:28.953
Because of them, now I wanna know
what it feels like to grow up.

02:03:30.079 --> 02:03:31.789
To fall in love.

02:03:32.581 --> 02:03:34.208
To have a family.

02:03:35.501 --> 02:03:39.171
And to know, in the end, I've lived.

02:03:46.303 --> 02:03:47.429
It's all over now.

02:03:48.264 --> 02:03:50.599
We get to start over somewhere new.

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.146
Well, that was very moving.

02:03:56.313 --> 02:03:57.565
Druig.

02:04:03.279 --> 02:04:04.822
I can't do this.

02:04:08.492 --> 02:04:10.369
This is your fight now.

02:04:54.955 --> 02:04:56.165
Thena.

02:04:57.541 --> 02:04:58.792
It's me.

02:04:59.376 --> 02:05:00.544
Gilgamesh.

02:05:01.962 --> 02:05:03.005
Look at me.

02:05:04.048 --> 02:05:05.341
Gilgamesh?

02:05:05.508 --> 02:05:07.051
Stay here.

02:05:09.762 --> 02:05:11.013
Say it.

02:05:11.555 --> 02:05:13.224
Stay here.

02:05:14.099 --> 02:05:15.809
You'll be okay.

02:05:17.853 --> 02:05:19.688
Give me your hand.

02:05:32.993 --> 02:05:34.203
It's a shame.

02:05:36.247 --> 02:05:37.873
You and I...

02:05:38.457 --> 02:05:40.376
we're just tools of a god.

02:05:41.752 --> 02:05:44.964
Built to kill.

02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:49.051
Thena.

02:05:52.513 --> 02:05:53.889
Remember.

02:06:24.378 --> 02:06:25.963
I remember.

02:07:55.261 --> 02:07:56.720
Come on, Sersi.

02:07:57.763 --> 02:07:58.848
Come on.

02:10:08.018 --> 02:10:09.770
It's beautiful, isn't it?

02:12:38.919 --> 02:12:40.462
I'm sorry.

02:12:42.173 --> 02:12:43.632
I know.

02:13:59.208 --> 02:14:00.251
How?

02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:02.086
How did you do it?

02:14:03.212 --> 02:14:06.465
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

02:14:06.882 --> 02:14:09.260
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

02:14:09.426 --> 02:14:10.761
I always wondered how we survived...

02:14:10.928 --> 02:14:13.597
the destruction of other planets
that we were on.

02:14:13.973 --> 02:14:16.475
By being connected to the Celestial
as it emerged.

02:15:20.206 --> 02:15:21.415
Is he gone?

02:15:31.091 --> 02:15:32.343
Sprite.

02:15:34.845 --> 02:15:37.431
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:40.559
I think I can make you human.

02:15:41.936 --> 02:15:44.855
All the things you said you wanted,
you can have them.

02:15:45.022 --> 02:15:47.900
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

02:15:48.067 --> 02:15:49.109
Are you ready for that?

02:15:51.529 --> 02:15:52.947
I am.

02:16:30.359 --> 02:16:32.486
<i>The sudden appearance of an enormous
stone figure in the Indian Ocean...</i>

02:16:34.154 --> 02:16:36.949
<i>...has left more questions than answers
for authorities.</i>

02:16:37.825 --> 02:16:41.327
<i>U.S. and Australian naval ships
are maintaining defensive positions...</i>

02:16:41.495 --> 02:16:42.495
<i>but at this...</i>

02:16:42.663 --> 02:16:44.540
You guys did that?

02:16:45.332 --> 02:16:47.626
I love you so much.

02:16:54.924 --> 02:16:56.302
Are you okay?

02:16:57.218 --> 02:16:59.221
I get confused sometimes.

02:16:59.388 --> 02:17:01.432
Yeah. Me, too.

02:17:04.018 --> 02:17:06.312
So, Dad said you're the goddess Athena.

02:17:06.477 --> 02:17:08.564
"Thena." Drop the "A."

02:17:11.483 --> 02:17:13.318
What's your superpower?

02:17:17.198 --> 02:17:19.450
Can you just... Look... One second.

02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:21.826
Okay. All right.

02:17:22.369 --> 02:17:24.079
See, that thing is... Okay.

02:17:24.245 --> 02:17:25.748
Almost gave you a shave and a haircut,
didn't she?

02:17:25.915 --> 02:17:27.374
Stand behind me, actually.

02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:29.502
You remember earmuffs?
Remember how we practiced earmuffs?

02:17:29.668 --> 02:17:31.378
Thank you so much.

02:17:33.547 --> 02:17:36.258
You know that your babysitting privileges
are completely revoked, right?

02:17:36.424 --> 02:17:37.468
Like, it's done.

02:17:37.968 --> 02:17:39.844
Thank you. Violence... Hey.

02:17:40.012 --> 02:17:42.848
Violence is never the answer.
Right, T?

02:17:43.014 --> 02:17:45.643
You gotta always use your brain.

02:17:45.808 --> 02:17:47.520
Like you did fighting on the beach?

02:17:47.686 --> 02:17:48.938
Your dad...

02:17:49.103 --> 02:17:51.482
spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy...

02:17:51.648 --> 02:17:53.150
and he had no choice but to listen to me,
so no violence.

02:17:57.237 --> 02:17:58.739
When are you guys leaving?
When is that happening?

02:17:58.906 --> 02:18:00.782
That's happening soon, right?

02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:03.786
Yes, there's Druig.
Don't go anywhere near him.

02:18:04.327 --> 02:18:05.454
Yeah!

02:18:07.873 --> 02:18:09.208
Okay, that's far enough, Jack.

02:18:09.375 --> 02:18:11.709
Wow, Dad, the <i>Domo</i>'s so cool.

02:18:11.877 --> 02:18:13.504
Your dad fixed that with his bare hands.

02:18:13.671 --> 02:18:15.255
Can we go to space, too, one day?

02:18:15.422 --> 02:18:17.924
Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:20.218
Hey, Phastos.

02:18:21.053 --> 02:18:22.429
Take care.

02:18:22.805 --> 02:18:24.389
This world is lucky to have you.

02:18:25.224 --> 02:18:26.851
Thank you.

02:18:27.017 --> 02:18:28.686
I know you're not a hugger, so...

02:18:31.856 --> 02:18:32.940
Okay.

02:18:35.901 --> 02:18:39.989
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there...

02:18:40.155 --> 02:18:43.157
that they'll accept the truth the way we did?

02:19:01.050 --> 02:19:02.761
Told you that thing was addictive.

02:19:03.929 --> 02:19:04.972
Please visit?

02:19:05.598 --> 02:19:06.807
I'll try.

02:19:07.391 --> 02:19:08.726
When I get time off from school.

02:19:08.893 --> 02:19:11.562
Oh, wow. Listen, it's gonna be good for you
to be in a human environment.

02:19:11.728 --> 02:19:13.522
You'll pick up some social skills.

02:19:14.064 --> 02:19:15.441
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

02:19:16.816 --> 02:19:18.818
That explains so much.

02:19:28.537 --> 02:19:30.080
Gonna miss you.

02:19:30.623 --> 02:19:31.832
Me, too.

02:19:35.503 --> 02:19:36.629
Madam.

02:19:37.087 --> 02:19:38.379
Thanks, Karun.

02:19:38.964 --> 02:19:41.424
Sometimes I wonder if we did the right thing.

02:19:43.052 --> 02:19:44.136
Killing Tiamut.

02:19:44.303 --> 02:19:46.055
It's too late for that.

02:19:46.222 --> 02:19:48.182
But you followed your heart.

02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:49.808
We all did.

02:19:52.019 --> 02:19:53.020
Even Ikaris.

02:20:00.611 --> 02:20:02.571
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

02:20:03.739 --> 02:20:05.866
He's a lot cuter in person.

02:20:08.285 --> 02:20:11.497
So, after all that,
you still can't change me into a giraffe?

02:20:12.164 --> 02:20:15.835
Well, I could next time
I'm connected to a Celestial...

02:20:16.001 --> 02:20:18.212
during an emergence
whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

02:20:18.379 --> 02:20:21.173
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

02:20:25.135 --> 02:20:26.554
What'll you do now?

02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:28.013
Not sure.

02:20:28.180 --> 02:20:30.182
This planet's my home, but...

02:20:31.934 --> 02:20:34.645
I can't pretend to be human anymore.

02:20:41.235 --> 02:20:42.820
I love you, Sersi.

02:20:44.363 --> 02:20:45.447
I don't care what you are.

02:20:59.253 --> 02:21:01.881
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

02:21:02.047 --> 02:21:05.050
I have no more secrets, I promise.

02:21:05.217 --> 02:21:06.719
Actually...

02:21:06.886 --> 02:21:09.180
I have one I want to tell you.

02:21:10.264 --> 02:21:11.807
What is it?

02:21:13.767 --> 02:21:16.270
It turns out my family history is...

02:21:17.188 --> 02:21:18.772
complicated.

02:21:22.193 --> 02:21:23.569
Sersi?

02:21:24.361 --> 02:21:25.863
Sersi, what's wrong?

02:21:27.323 --> 02:21:28.657
Sersi?

02:21:52.473 --> 02:21:53.849
Sersi?

02:21:54.725 --> 02:21:55.976
Sersi?

02:21:56.852 --> 02:21:59.021
Sersi!

02:22:13.827 --> 02:22:17.206
You have chosen to sacrifice a Celestial...

02:22:17.581 --> 02:22:20.000
for the people of this planet.

02:22:21.293 --> 02:22:23.087
I will spare them...

02:22:23.254 --> 02:22:27.967
but your memories will show
if they're worthy to live.

02:22:29.468 --> 02:22:33.681
And I will return for judgment.

02:22:49.071 --> 02:22:51.115
You all right, Ted?

02:22:52.825 --> 02:22:54.702
Did you see that?

02:26:04.308 --> 02:26:05.643
Arishem.

02:26:07.895 --> 02:26:09.605
We have to go back.

02:26:22.576 --> 02:26:23.911
What?

02:26:36.799 --> 02:26:37.883
Wow.

02:26:38.759 --> 02:26:41.387
My ears. My eyes are numb.

02:26:41.554 --> 02:26:44.390
No more drunk teleporting for you.

02:26:45.724 --> 02:26:46.892
Hang on, hang on.

02:26:52.773 --> 02:26:54.233
Behold...

02:26:54.900 --> 02:26:57.486
the royal prince of Titan...

02:26:57.653 --> 02:27:00.865
brother of Thanos, the Knave of Hearts...

02:27:01.031 --> 02:27:02.116
defeater...

02:27:03.450 --> 02:27:05.411
-...of Black Robert...
-Roger.

02:27:07.329 --> 02:27:09.790
Defeater of Black Roger.

02:27:10.416 --> 02:27:11.709
The great adventurer...

02:27:12.251 --> 02:27:16.172
Starfox of Mystery Planet.

02:27:16.755 --> 02:27:18.966
What a pleasure to make your acquaintance...

02:27:19.508 --> 02:27:21.385
my fellow Eternals.

02:27:22.428 --> 02:27:24.763
You know, you really don't have to
do the whole thing every time.

02:27:24.930 --> 02:27:26.140
Everything you do is impressive.

02:27:26.307 --> 02:27:27.308
-What am I gonna leave off the list?
-No, I know it's impressive.

02:27:27.558 --> 02:27:28.559
Who are you?

02:27:30.811 --> 02:27:31.937
I'm Eros.

02:27:32.438 --> 02:27:33.480
This is Pip.

02:27:33.898 --> 02:27:37.109
And you are as beautiful
as legends say, Thena.

02:27:37.276 --> 02:27:38.569
What do you want, lads?

02:27:38.736 --> 02:27:40.404
Pip and I are here to help,
aren't we?

02:27:45.868 --> 02:27:47.953
Your friends are in big trouble.

02:27:49.622 --> 02:27:51.707
And we know where to find them.

02:34:43.118 --> 02:34:44.578
You can do this.

02:34:45.829 --> 02:34:47.665
You can do this.

02:35:11.939 --> 02:35:13.440
I'm sorry.

02:35:15.651 --> 02:35:17.278
I have to try.
