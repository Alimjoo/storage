然后我就要送你出门了
before I get you out of the door.

11:17.130 --> 11:18.680
如果你还没到  飞机就飞了
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose

11:18.680 --> 11:19.660
那有自己的飞机
of having your own plane

11:19.670 --> 11:21.160
不就没意义了吗
if it departs before you arrive?

11:21.170 --> 11:22.410
拉里来电
Larry called.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.490
他为杰克逊·波洛克画找到了新买家
He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.350
你还想不想要它
Do you want it? Yes or no.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.640
那是他的"春"期代表作吗
Is it a good representation of his spring period?

11:29.220 --> 11:31.690
不是  斯普林斯是他曾生活工作过的
No. The Springs was actually the neighbourhood in East Hampton

11:31.700 --> 11:33.050
一个东汉普顿社区
where he lived and worked,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.700
-并不是春天的"春"  -是吗
- not "spring" like the season. - So?

11:34.710 --> 11:39.410
我觉得还可以  而且定价过高了
I think it's a fair example. I think it's incredibly overpriced.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.710
我要  买  存起来
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.990
好  麻省理工学院毕业典礼讲话
Okay. The MIT commencement speech...

11:46.000 --> 11:47.150
6月的事  拜托
Is in June. Please,

11:47.160 --> 11:48.350
别拿还没影的事来唠叨我
don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...

11:48.350 --> 11:51.340
他们在唠叨我  我就答应了
They're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.

11:51.350 --> 11:52.110
反弹或吸收
Deflect it and absorb it.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.670
-别传递给我  -你上机前
- Don't transmit it back to me. - I need you to sign this

11:53.670 --> 11:55.020
-我需要你给这个签字  -你干吗非要赶我走
- before you get on the plane. - What are you trying to get rid of me for?

11:55.030 --> 11:56.350
你有安排吗
What, you got plans?

11:56.360 --> 11:59.040
-事实上  真有  -我不喜欢你有安排
- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans.

11:59.050 --> 12:01.070
我生日这天是可以有安排的
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.780
-今天是你生日吗  -嗯
- It's your birthday? - Yes.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.230
我知道的  这就到了吗
I knew that. Already?

12:04.240 --> 12:07.900
是的  多奇怪啊  跟去年是同一天
Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.

12:08.710 --> 12:11.310
-拿我的钱给自己买点好东西吧  -买了
- Get yourself something nice from me. - I already did.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.980
-怎么样  -可好了
- And? - It was very nice.

12:13.990 --> 12:17.930
-嗯  -很有品味  谢谢  斯塔克先生
- Yeah. - Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr Stark.

12:17.940 --> 12:19.570
不客气  波茨小姐
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

12:23.330 --> 12:24.320
好了
Okay.

12:42.710 --> 12:46.460
你挺厉害  我刚刚以为甩掉你了
You're good. I thought I lost you back there.

12:46.930 --> 12:48.000
是这样  先生
You did, sir.

12:49.380 --> 12:51.020
我不得不抄穆赫兰道的捷径
I had to cut across Mulholland.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.580
被我甩掉了吧
I got you. I got you.

12:52.590 --> 12:54.150
你什么毛病
What's wrong with you?

12:54.160 --> 12:55.780
-怎么了  -三小时
- What? - Three hours.

12:55.790 --> 12:57.820
忙着接受《名利场》的采访呢
I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.

12:57.830 --> 13:00.000
三小时  你让我在这儿站了三小时
For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.470
现在等你了  走吧  快来
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

13:03.170 --> 13:05.380
起飞  开始吧
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

13:13.270 --> 13:15.880
-你看什么呢  鸭嘴兽  -没事
- What you reading, platypus? - Nothing.

13:15.890 --> 13:18.190
得了  酸糖娃  别生气嘛
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.090
我说了  我没生气  我不在乎  好吗
I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?

13:21.100 --> 13:22.550
-我都道歉了  -早上好  斯塔克先生
- I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr Stark.

13:22.560 --> 13:23.550
你不用向我道歉
You don't need to apologise to me.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.880
-我是你的哥们  -我都跟他道歉了  但他
- I'm your man. - I told him I was sorry, but he...

13:24.890 --> 13:26.690
-我现在就是不在乎了  -热毛巾要吗
- I'm just indifferent right now. - Hot towel?

13:26.700 --> 13:29.090
你不尊重自己  所以我知道你不尊重我
You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.200
-我尊重你  -我就是你的保姆
- I respect you. - I'm just your babysitter.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.170
如果你需要换尿布了  谢谢
So, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.720
就告诉我  我去给你拿奶瓶  好吗
Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.140
加热下清酒  好吗
Heat up the sake, will you?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.630
-多谢提醒我  -我不是说
- Thanks for reminding me. - No, I'm not talking...

13:38.640 --> 13:40.500
我们不喝酒  我们在工作
We're not drinking. We're working right now.

13:40.510 --> 13:42.830
-吃生鱼片一定要配清酒  -你根本就是
- You can't have sashimi without sake. - You are constitutionally

13:42.840 --> 13:44.810
做不到负责任
incapable of being responsible.

13:44.820 --> 13:46.120
不喝酒才不负责
It would be irresponsible not to drink.

13:46.130 --> 13:47.150
不过是一杯睡前酒
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.380
热清酒
Hot sake?

13:48.390 --> 13:49.230
好  来两杯  谢谢
Yes, two, please.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.810
不  我不喝  我不要
No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

13:51.820 --> 13:53.180
我就这意思
That's what I'm talking about.

13:53.190 --> 13:56.180
我早上起床  穿上军服
When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform,

13:56.190 --> 13:58.290
知道我认得什么吗
you know what I recognise?

13:58.300 --> 13:59.530
我在镜子里能看到
I see in that mirror that

13:59.540 --> 14:03.450
每一个穿着这军服的人都会照应我
every person that's got this uniform on got my back!

14:03.460 --> 14:05.820
知道吗  我跟你不一样  我不适合
Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

14:05.830 --> 14:07.900
不  你不非得像我一样
No, no. You don't have to be like me!

14:07.910 --> 14:09.310
但你远不止现在的你自己
But you're more than what you are.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.380
抱歉  我现在有点无法集中精神
Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?

14:11.390 --> 14:14.890
不  你现在不能不集中精神  听我说
No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!

We look forward to your weapons presentation.

14:35.990 --> 14:36.940
谢谢
Thanks.

14:38.730 --> 14:41.810
被恐惧和被尊敬  哪个更好
Is it better to be feared or respected?

14:41.820 --> 14:45.140
要我说  两个都要算过分吗
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

14:45.830 --> 14:48.750
因此  我谦卑地献上斯塔克工业
With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel

14:48.760 --> 14:50.660
自由系列的旗舰产品
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

14:50.670 --> 14:51.700
这是第一个融入了
It's the first missile system

14:51.710 --> 14:54.810
我们的专利冲击科技的导弹系统
to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology.

14:54.820 --> 14:58.890
人说最好的武器是不需要使用的武器
They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.920
我尊重地表示不同意
I respectfully disagree.

15:00.930 --> 15:05.220
我更喜欢你只需要使用一次的武器
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once.

15:05.230 --> 15:08.500
我老爸就这么做  美国就这么做
That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it.

15:09.130 --> 15:11.470
而且到目前一直挺成功
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.820
找个借口
Find an excuse

15:12.830 --> 15:16.250
发射一次这玩意  我亲自担保
to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you

15:16.260 --> 15:19.690
坏蛋再也不会想从洞里爬出来了
the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.

15:38.220 --> 15:42.700
供您参考  耶利哥
For your consideration, the Jericho.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.290
每笔超过五亿的交易
I'll be throwing one of these in

15:54.300 --> 15:56.840
我送一个这个
with every purchase of 500 million or more.

15:56.850 --> 15:57.960

不清楚情况我睡不着  展示得怎么样
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?

16:04.240 --> 16:06.610
很好  看来圣诞节要提前了
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.220
好样的  伙计  明天见了
Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

16:10.230 --> 16:11.440
你怎么没穿我送你的睡衣
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas I got you?

16:11.450 --> 16:13.000
晚安  托尼
Good night, Tony.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.150
-托尼  -抱歉  这辆车是"欢乐马"
- Hey, Tony. - I'm sorry, this is the "Fun-vee."

16:17.160 --> 16:19.020
"悍无聊马"在后面
The "Hum-drum-vee" Is back there.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.980
-好样的  -基地见
- Nice job. - See you back at base.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.640
我劝你别那么做
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

18:07.790 --> 18:09.440
你对我做了什么
What the hell did you do to me?

18:10.420 --> 18:11.560
我做了什么
What I did?

18:13.140 --> 18:15.250
我做的事是救你命
What I did is to save your life.

18:15.260 --> 18:18.750
我已经尽力移除了很多弹片  但还剩不少
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left,

18:18.760 --> 18:21.100
而且它们都在往你的房隔去
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

18:21.380 --> 18:22.590
想看看吗
Here, want to see?

18:23.890 --> 18:26.900
我留了纪念品  看看吧
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.800
我在我的村子里见过不少这样的伤
I've seen many wounds like that in my village.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.320
我们称他们为将死行尸
We call them the walking dead

18:34.330 --> 18:35.490
因为大概要一周
because it takes about a week

18:35.500 --> 18:37.440
弹片才会进入重要器官
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

18:37.450 --> 18:41.110
-这是什么  -那是块电磁铁
- What is this? - That is an electromagnet,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.270
连在了汽车电池上
hooked up to a car battery,

18:43.280 --> 18:45.980
它在阻止弹片进入你的心脏
and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.

18:54.410 --> 18:56.900
没错  笑笑
That's right. Smile.

18:58.200 --> 19:02.440
我们见过一次  在伯尔尼的一场科技大会上
We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.830
-我不记得了  -当然了
- I don't remember. - No, you wouldn't.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.890
如果我喝得那么醉  肯定站都站不直
If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand,

19:08.900 --> 19:12.340
更别说就集成电路发表讲话了
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.

19:12.350 --> 19:13.460

Where are we?

19:15.430 --> 19:17.730

Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?

19:26.450 --> 19:28.690
你听懂了没  学我的样子做
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

19:49.310 --> 19:53.640
他说"欢迎  托尼·斯塔克  美国历史上
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer

19:53.650 --> 19:55.540
最著名的大屠杀犯"

19:58.790 --> 19:59.920
他很荣幸
He is honoured.

20:02.830 --> 20:04.880
他要你给他建导弹
He wants you to build the missile.

你展示的那个耶利哥导弹
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.970

他说要你立刻开始动手
He says for you to start working immediately,

21:47.960 --> 21:51.070
你做好了  他就放了你
and when you're done, he will set you free.

21:54.530 --> 21:57.630
-不  他不会的  -是啊
- No, he won't. - No, he won't.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.330
但在这些山里  他们是找不到你的
But they will never find you in these mountains.

22:19.820 --> 22:22.160
你刚刚看到一切
Look, what you just saw,

22:22.760 --> 22:24.980
那就是你的遗产  斯塔克
that is your legacy, Stark.

22:26.420 --> 22:29.920
你一生的心血  落在那些杀人犯手里
Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers.

22:29.930 --> 22:31.520
你想这样死去吗
Is that how you want to go out?

22:32.700 --> 22:35.500
这就是伟大的托尼·斯塔克的
Is this the last act of defiance

22:35.500 --> 22:37.950
最后反抗吗
of the great Tony Stark?

22:38.380 --> 22:40.080
还是说你要想想办法
Or are you going to do something about it?

22:40.090 --> 22:41.220
我何必还要做点什么
Why should I do anything?

22:41.230 --> 22:45.230

They're going to kill me, you, either way.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.590

或者让什么大玩意跑15分钟
Or something big for 15 minutes.

看上去完全不像照片上的东西
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.580

46:18.180 --> 46:20.650
随后向大家通报
and we'll get back to you with the follow-up.

46:22.820 --> 46:25.210
-他人呢  -在里面
- Where is he? - He's inside.

46:35.890 --> 46:38.990
那...挺顺利嘛
Well, that... That went well.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.430
我是在脑后放了个靶子吗
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?

46:41.440 --> 46:43.850
你的脑袋  那我的脑袋呢
Your head? What about my head?

46:43.860 --> 46:45.410
你觉得明天股价
What do you think the over-under on the stock

46:45.420 --> 46:47.030
会跌到什么程度
drop is gonna be tomorrow?

46:47.040 --> 46:50.170
-乐观估计  40点  -至少
- Optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum.

46:50.580 --> 46:51.500
是啊
Yep.

46:51.750 --> 46:55.030
托尼  我们是武器制造商
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

46:55.040 --> 46:57.710
奥比  我不希望我们将来只留下杀伤数字
Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.

46:57.720 --> 46:58.840
这是我们的工作
That's what we do.

46:58.840 --> 47:00.670
我们是铁商  我们制造武器
We're iron mongers. We make weapons.

47:00.680 --> 47:01.620
大楼上是我的名字
It's my name on the side of the building.

47:01.630 --> 47:04.500
我们的工作让世界不会陷入混乱
And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.

47:04.510 --> 47:05.960
我看到的可不是这样
Not based on what I saw.

47:07.620 --> 47:08.630
我们做得不够好
We're not doing a good enough job.

47:08.640 --> 47:09.850
我们可以做得更好  我们要做别的
We can do better. We're gonna do something else.

47:09.860 --> 47:13.090
什么别的  你要我们做奶瓶吗
Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?

47:14.090 --> 47:17.330
我认为我们该重新考虑方舟反应堆科技
I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.

47:17.340 --> 47:21.840
得了  方舟反应堆就是个噱头
Come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

47:21.850 --> 47:22.740
托尼  拜托
Tony, come on.

47:22.740 --> 47:25.160
我们建这个是为了堵嬉皮士的嘴
We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

47:25.170 --> 47:28.870
-成功了  -是啊  作为科学项目
- It works. - Yeah, as a science project.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.300
方舟反应堆的效益性根本不好
The arc was never cost effective.

47:30.310 --> 47:32.220
我们建造之前就知道了
We knew that before we built it.

47:32.230 --> 47:35.440
方舟反应堆科技是个死胡同  是吧
Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?

47:35.450 --> 47:36.490
或许吧
Maybe.

47:36.960 --> 47:39.880
是吧  我们在这方面多久没有突破了
Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what?

47:39.890 --> 47:41.660
-30年吗  -据说是的
- Thirty years. - That's what they say.

47:44.980 --> 47:47.200
你的扑克脸能更糟点吗  告诉我  谁说的
Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?

47:47.210 --> 47:50.450
-别管了  给我看  -罗德还是派珀
- Never mind who told me. Show me. - It's Rhodey or Pepper.

47:50.460 --> 47:52.450
-我要看  -好吧  是罗德
- I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.040

- Okay. - Okay?

48:06.070 --> 48:07.080
成功了
It works.

48:11.360 --> 48:15.520
听我说  托尼  我们是一队的  懂吗
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand?

48:15.530 --> 48:18.770
只要我们合力  没什么是做不到的
There's nothing we can't do if we stick together,

48:18.780 --> 48:20.400
就像当年我和你父亲
like your father and I.

48:20.410 --> 48:22.440
抱歉我没提前跟你商量
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay?

48:22.450 --> 48:23.780
-但如果我说了  -托尼
- But if I had... - Tony.

48:23.790 --> 48:27.200
托尼  别再干这种脱口而出的事了
Tony, no more of this "ready, fire, aim" business.

48:27.210 --> 48:29.070
-明白吗  -那是老爸常说的话
- You understand me? - That was Dad's line.

48:30.520 --> 48:32.690
你得让我来处理
You gotta let me handle this.

48:32.700 --> 48:35.060
我们现在得玩另一套把戏了
We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now.

48:35.070 --> 48:37.110
我们要承受很大压力
We're going to have to take a lot of heat.

48:37.120 --> 48:40.580
我要你保证  你会低调些
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.

48:40.590 --> 48:42.430
斯塔克工业
Stark lndustries!

48:42.440 --> 48:45.590
我给你推荐条路  准备好了吗
I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready?

48:45.890 --> 48:46.730
卖卖卖
Sell, sell, sell!

48:46.740 --> 48:48.980
弃船
Abandon ship!

48:48.990 --> 48:52.450
兴登堡飞艇的事记得吗
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

48:53.530 --> 48:54.620
我给大家看看
Let me show you

48:54.620 --> 48:58.890
新斯塔克工业的商业计划
the new Stark lndustries business plan!

49:00.090 --> 49:04.180
这就是一家不造武器的武器公司
Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!

49:04.560 --> 49:07.550
派珀  你的手有多大
Pepper. How big are your hands?

49:07.910 --> 49:10.080
-什么  -你的手有多大
- What? - How big are your hands?

49:10.090 --> 49:13.130
-我不懂这...  -下来  我需要你
- I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you.

49:23.560 --> 49:24.970
伸出来  给我看看你的手
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.120
给我看看
Let's see them.

49:27.710 --> 49:30.040
好小  好精巧
They are small. Very petite, indeed.

49:30.360 --> 49:32.870
我需要你帮个忙
I just need your help for a sec.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.200
天呐  那就是维系你生命的东西吗
Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?

49:36.210 --> 49:39.400
之前是  现在是古董了
It was. It is now an antique.

49:39.410 --> 49:42.420
这个将在未来一段时间内维系我的生命
This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.

49:42.430 --> 49:43.950
我要换升级版的
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,

49:43.960 --> 49:47.000
现在遭遇了点障碍
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

49:47.370 --> 49:48.740
障碍  什么意思
Speed bump, what does that mean?

49:48.750 --> 49:49.880
没事  就是个小问题
It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

49:49.890 --> 49:53.560
这个装置下面有条暴露的电线
There's an exposed wire under this device.

49:53.570 --> 49:55.040
接触到了槽壁
And it's contacting the socket wall

49:55.050 --> 49:56.680
造成了短路
and causing a little bit of a short.

49:56.690 --> 49:58.960
没事的
It's fine.

49:59.300 --> 50:00.900
-你要我做什么  -放在那边桌上
- What do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there.

50:00.910 --> 50:03.220
-那个没用了  -天呐
- That is irrelevant. - Oh, my God!

50:03.230 --> 50:04.680
你伸手进去
I want you to reach in,

50:04.690 --> 50:07.050
轻轻地把电线拉出来
and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.

50:08.360 --> 50:10.360
-安全吗  -应该没事
- Is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine.

50:10.370 --> 50:11.770
就像手术游戏  别让电线
It's like Operation. You just don't let it

50:11.780 --> 50:14.030
碰到槽壁就行  否则就会发出哔声
touch the socket wall or it goes "beep."

50:14.040 --> 50:14.860
什么"手术游戏"
What do you mean, "Operation"?

50:14.860 --> 50:16.200
就是个游戏  算了
It's just a game, never mind.

50:16.210 --> 50:18.530
-轻轻地把电线拉出来  -好
- Just gently lift the wire. - Okay.

50:18.870 --> 50:20.420
好吗  很好
Okay? Great.

50:22.020 --> 50:24.690
我觉得我做这个不够格
You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.

50:24.700 --> 50:28.700
你可以的  你是我认识的最够格
No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified,

50:28.710 --> 50:32.270
最值得信赖的人  你会做得很棒的
trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great.

50:33.590 --> 50:35.510
这个要求太过分了吗  因为我
Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...

50:35.520 --> 50:37.570
-好吧  -我真的需要你帮忙
- Okay, okay. - I really need your help here.

50:38.470 --> 50:39.440
好了
Okay.

50:43.810 --> 50:45.470
有脓液
Oh, there's pus!

50:45.480 --> 50:46.420
不是脓液
It's not pus.

50:46.430 --> 50:50.090
是装置释放出的无机原生质
It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,

50:50.100 --> 50:52.290
-不是我身体分泌的  -好臭
- not from my body. - It smells!

50:52.300 --> 50:53.450
是啊
Yeah, it does.

50:54.110 --> 50:56.510
铜线  铜线  摸到了吗
The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?

50:56.520 --> 50:58.000
-好  摸到了  -摸到了吗
- Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?

50:58.010 --> 51:00.900
拉出来时不要碰到槽壁
Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!

51:00.910 --> 51:03.160
-我之前就是跟你强调这个  -抱歉
- That's what I was trying to tell you before. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

51:03.550 --> 51:05.610
拉出来时  一定不要拉出...
Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don't...

51:05.620 --> 51:07.070
最末端的磁铁
There's a magnet at the end of it!

51:07.080 --> 51:08.800
就这个  你给拉出来了
That was it. You just pulled it out.

51:08.810 --> 51:10.160
-天呐  -我没想到...
- Oh, God! - Okay, I was not expecting...

51:10.170 --> 51:12.010
-别放回去  -我怎么办
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in! - Okay, what do I do?

51:12.390 --> 51:13.280
怎么了
What's wrong?

51:13.290 --> 51:14.850
没事  我就是要心脏骤停了
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest

51:14.860 --> 51:15.930
-因为你像捞鱼一样  -什么
- 'cause you yanked - What?

51:15.930 --> 51:17.660
-把它揪出来了  -你不是说挺安全的吗
- it out like a trout... - I though you said it was safe!

51:17.670 --> 51:18.900
我们得快了  拿这个
We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

51:18.910 --> 51:21.570

-会没事的  -是吗
- It's going to be okay. - Is it?

51:23.700 --> 51:24.680
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

51:24.690 --> 51:26.880

挺好玩的吧
That was fun, right?

51:38.200 --> 51:39.970

51:46.600 --> 51:49.700
永远永远永远
Don't ever, ever, ever,

51:49.710 --> 51:52.770
别再要求我做这样的事了
ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.

51:52.780 --> 51:54.800
我只有你
I don't have anyone but you.

52:00.450 --> 52:01.470
好了
Anyway...

52:07.340 --> 52:09.660
-这个你要我怎么处理  -那个吗
- What do you want me to do with this? - That?

52:11.100 --> 52:12.110

52:15.150 --> 52:16.490

派珀  人们说我有很多特点
Pepper, I've been called many things.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.170
但不包括"怀旧"
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

52:21.570 --> 52:22.950

Will that be all, Mr Stark?

52:22.960 --> 52:24.550

That will be all, Miss Potts.

52:25.980 --> 52:27.490

空中战斗的未来  是有人还是无人
The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned?

52:46.800 --> 52:49.000
以我的经验
I'll tell you, in my experience,

52:49.010 --> 52:51.170
无人机永远
no unmanned aerial vehicle

52:51.170 --> 52:54.130
比不过飞行员的直觉
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

52:54.140 --> 52:55.580
见解
his insight,

52:55.590 --> 52:58.350
以及看透表象
that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious

52:58.360 --> 53:02.270
确定结果的判断力
and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgement.

53:02.270 --> 53:05.290
中校  何不让飞行员摆脱飞机
Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?

I'm doing a little better than walking.

53:33.010 --> 53:34.340

'cause that little stunt at the press conference,

53:47.790 --> 53:49.130
太逗了
that was a doozy.

53:49.790 --> 53:54.370
这不是给军队的  我不...这不一样
This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.

53:54.370 --> 53:57.110

What? You're a humanitarian now or something?

53:57.110 --> 53:58.610
-我需要你听我说  -不
- I need you to listen to me. - No.

53:58.620 --> 54:02.710
你需要时间把思绪理清楚
What you need is time to get your mind right.

54:04.380 --> 54:06.210
-我说真的  -好吧
- I'm serious. - Okay.

54:35.850 --> 54:36.510

57:40.830 --> 57:41.780
是的
It is.

57:42.430 --> 57:45.810
这是飞行稳定器  完全无害
This is a flight stabiliser. It's completely harmless.

57:49.950 --> 57:51.290
这我没料到
I didn't expect that.

57:56.480 --> 57:57.460
怎么样
How'd it go?

58:00.470 --> 58:01.820
那么不顺利啊
It went that bad, huh?

58:01.940 --> 58:04.510
就因为我从纽约带了披萨回来
Just because I brought pizza back from New York

58:04.510 --> 58:06.170
不代表就不顺利
doesn't mean it went bad.

58:06.670 --> 58:08.500
当然了  天呐
Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

58:08.540 --> 58:10.590

We knew that was gonna happen.

58:32.350 --> 58:34.600

让我觉得我随时会自燃

是啊  是这样
Yeah. Speaking of funny,

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.270
有个武器站刚被炸毁了
we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up

离你当初被囚的地方只有几公里
a few clicks from where you were being held captive.

01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:47.880

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:56.530
到了峡谷  然后去慢跑
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

01:20:56.530 --> 01:20:57.730
你在那一带真没有什么
You sure you don't have any tech

01:20:57.730 --> 01:20:59.110
我应该知道的东西吗
in that area I should know about?

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.740
-没有  -发现不明物体了
- Nope! - Bogey spotted!

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.070

很好  因为我眼前就有个东西
Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now,

01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:06.000

-能进行无线电联络吗  -无反应  长官
- You have radio contact? - Non responsive, sir.

01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:24.700
那你可以交火

That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:07.930
卫星盯丢了
The sat visual has been lost.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.790
那绝不是无人机
No way that's a UAV.

01:22:09.850 --> 01:22:10.870
是什么
What is it?

01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:12.300
我什么都看不到
I can't see anything.

We are now running on emergency backup power.

01:49:12.630 --> 01:49:16.210
-波茨  -托尼  天呐  你没事吧
- Potts! - Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:17.550
我快没电了
I'm almost out of power.

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.860
我得脱掉战衣  我就过去
I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.

01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:21.650
想得美
Nice try!

01:49:34.710 --> 01:49:36.270
武器状态
Weapons status?

01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:39.000
冲击系统下线  导弹下线
Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:43.910
燃烧弹
Flares!

01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:55.090
真聪明  托尼
Very clever, Tony.

01:50:00.290 --> 01:50:02.830
-波茨  -托尼
- Potts? - Tony!

01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:03.410
这样不行
This isn't working.

01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:06.040
我们得过载反应堆  炸碎屋顶
We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.

01:50:06.290 --> 01:50:09.180
-你要怎么做到  -你来做
- Well, how are you going to do that? - You're going to do it.

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.720
去中央控制台  打开所有电路
Go to the central console, open up all the circuits.

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:13.020
等我撤离了屋顶  就告诉你
When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know.

01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:15.420
你就按下主旁路按钮
You're going to hit the master bypass button.

01:50:16.010 --> 01:50:17.670
上面的一切都会被烧毁
It's going to fry everything up here.

01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:21.840
好  我这就进去
Okay. I'm going in now.

01:50:21.850 --> 01:50:24.990
一定等我离开屋顶的  我给你争取点时间
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time.

01:50:34.650 --> 01:50:36.100
这个看上去挺重要
This looks important!

01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.870
我一向不怎么喜欢这种玩意
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:04.570
但我得承认  我非常喜欢这件战衣
but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:15.120
你可算超常发挥了  托尼
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:19.700
你会让你父亲自豪的
You'd have made your father proud!

01:51:24.650 --> 01:51:26.740
准备好了  托尼  快离开屋顶
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:48.130
托尼
Tony!

01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:50.950
真是讽刺  托尼
How ironic, Tony!

01:51:52.730 --> 01:51:54.830
你想让世界上不再有武器
Trying to rid the world of weapons,

01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:57.650
却发明了最棒的武器
you gave it its best one ever!

01:51:57.650 --> 01:51:59.970
-派珀  -现在
- Pepper! - And now

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.500
我要拿它杀了你
I'm going to kill you with it!

01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:10.720
-你扯掉了我的瞄准系统  -按按钮
- You ripped out my targeting system! - Time to hit the button!

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:14.730
-你叫我别按的  -别动  你个小混蛋
- You told me not to! - Hold still, you little prick!

01:52:16.590 --> 01:52:19.540
-动手吧  -你会死的
- Just do it! - You'll die!

01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:23.740
按吧
Push it!

01:53:21.250 --> 01:53:22.790
托尼
Tony!

01:53:31.410 --> 01:53:33.360
各位都拿到了昨晚斯塔克工业
You've all received the official statement of

01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:43.210
<b>詹姆斯·罗德中校  斯塔克工业事件</b>

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.850
事件经过的官方报告
what occurred at Stark lndustries last night.

01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:38.140
有未经证实的报告称
There have been unconfirmed reports

01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:40.960
一件机器人原型机发生故障
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:43.630
导致方舟反应堆受损
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:46.680
幸好  托尼·斯塔克的一位私人保镖
Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:47.290
<b>钢铁侠是谁</b>

01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:48.630
"钢铁侠"  挺上口  挺响亮的
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it.

01:53:48.630 --> 01:53:49.980
虽然并不准确
I mean, it's not technically accurate.

01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:52.360
战衣是金钛合金
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:55.150
但这种意向呼之欲出
but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.340
这是你的不在场证明
Here's your alibi.

01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:58.750
好
Okay.

01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:01.060
-你在你的游艇上  -嗯
- You were on your yacht. - Yeah.

01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.250
我们有港口报告证明你整晚都在阿瓦隆
We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night,

01:54:03.250 --> 01:54:05.190
还有你50位宾客的宣誓证词
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.

01:54:05.190 --> 01:54:08.250
或许该说只有我和派珀
See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me

01:54:08.250 --> 01:54:10.130
单独在岛上
alone on the island.

01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:12.740
-就是这样的  -好吧
- That's what happened. - All right.

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.310
照读就行
Just read it, word for word.

01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:18.240
上面没提斯坦尼
There's nothing about Stane here.

01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:21.900
这已经处理好了  他去度假了
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

01:54:22.450 --> 01:54:24.990
小型飞机的安全记录很差
Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.680
但关于保镖的那套掩护说辞呢
But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard?

01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:28.930
他是我的...这...
He's my... I mean, is that...

01:54:28.930 --> 01:54:30.490
这太站不住脚了吧
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

01:54:30.630 --> 01:54:32.690
我不是第一次做这种事了  斯塔克先生
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr Stark.

01:54:33.010 --> 01:54:34.170
按官方说辞念就行
Just stick to the official statement,

01:54:34.170 --> 01:54:36.190
很快  这一切都会过去了
and soon, this will all be behind you.

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:39.590
你有90秒
You've got 90 seconds.

01:54:42.250 --> 01:54:43.330
科尔森特工
Agent Coulson?

01:54:44.590 --> 01:54:48.830
我想说  非常感谢你的一切帮助
I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.

01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:52.170
这是我们的职责  我们还会再联系的
That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.

01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:55.560
-你们叫国土战略  -喊我们神盾局就行
- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:54:56.170 --> 01:54:57.130
好
Right.

01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:59.890
我们开始吧
Let's get this show on the road.

01:54:59.890 --> 01:55:02.110
其实也没那么糟
You know, it's actually not that bad.

01:55:02.110 --> 01:55:03.810
就连我都不觉得自己像钢铁侠
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.240
-你不是钢铁侠  -我是
- You're not Iron Man. - Am so.

01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:08.270
-你不是  -好吧  随你
- You're not. - All right, suit yourself.

01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:10.260
如果我是钢铁侠
You know, if I were Iron Man,

01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:12.700
我会有个知道我真实身份的女友
I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:13.540
而且她会很崩溃
She'd be a wreck,

01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:15.280
因为她会非常担心我会不会送命
'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die,

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:17.870
但又为我的成就感到骄傲
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:22.390
她会非常矛盾  而这又让她更加
She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:24.450
为我疯狂了
crazy about me.

01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:26.230
你难道就没想过那晚的事吗
Tell me you never think about that night.

01:55:26.250 --> 01:55:27.790
-哪一晚  -你知道的
- What night? - You know.

01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:32.240
你是说
Are you talking about

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.270
我们一起跳舞的那晚吗
the night that we danced

01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:36.750
然后我们上了屋顶
and went up on the roof,

01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:39.650
然后
and then

01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:44.120
你去楼下拿酒
you went downstairs to get me a drink,

01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:47.840
然后就撇下了我一人
and you left me there, by myself?

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:50.340
你是说那晚吗
Is that the night you're talking about?

01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:54.520
我猜也是
Thought so.

01:55:57.110 --> 01:55:58.010
没有别的事了吧  斯塔克先生
Will that be all, Mr Stark?

01:55:58.010 --> 01:56:00.970
是的  没别的事了  波茨小姐
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

01:56:00.970 --> 01:56:04.570
现在  斯塔克先生准备了一份声明
And now, Mr Stark has prepared a statement.

01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:07.700
他不会接受提问的  谢谢
He will not be taking any questions. Thank you.

01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:14.020
自我上次见大家过去好一阵了
Been a while since I was in front of you.

01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:15.950
我这次还是照稿读吧
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:19.830
有人猜测
There's been speculation

01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:21.910
我卷入了之前发生在
that I was involved in the events that occurred

01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:23.180
高速和屋顶上的事件
on the freeway and the rooftop...

01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:24.290
抱歉  斯塔克先生
I'm sorry, Mr Stark,

01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:26.150
你真的指望我们相信
but do you honestly expect us to believe that

01:56:26.150 --> 01:56:30.040
那是一个穿战衣的保镖  碰巧出现
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,

01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:32.820
-尽管你...  -我知道情况让人糊涂
- despite the fact that you... - I know that it's confusing.

01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:35.900
质疑官方说辞是一回事
It is one thing to question the official story,

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:38.240
但提出疯狂指控  或暗示说
and another thing entirely to make wild accusations,

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:40.400
我是个超级英雄可是另一码事了
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:42.080
我可没说你是超级英雄
I never said you were a superhero.

01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:43.640
是吗  那很好
Didn't? Well, good,

01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:47.800
因为那是不着边际  异想天开的
because that would be outlandish and fantastic.

01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:53.040
我显然不是做英雄的料
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

01:56:53.210 --> 01:56:56.310
我有一堆性格缺陷
With this laundry list of character defects,

01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:57.760
犯过那么多错误
all the mistakes I've made,

01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:01.240
-还很公开  -照稿读就行
- largely public. - Just stick to the cards, man.

01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:03.150
好  好
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

01:57:05.010 --> 01:57:06.090
事实就是
The truth is

01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.060
我就是钢铁侠
I am Iron Man.

02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:18.470
贾维斯
Jarvis!

02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:20.680
欢迎回家  先生
Welcome home, sir.

02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:25.990
"我就是钢铁侠"
"I am Iron Man."

02:05:26.830 --> 02:05:29.560
你以为你是这世上唯一的超级英雄吗
You think you're the only superhero in the world?

02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:30.500
斯塔克先生
Mr Stark,

02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:32.920
你已经成为了更大的宇宙的一部分
you've become part of a bigger universe.

02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:35.250
你只是现在还不知道
You just don't know it yet.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.540
你是谁
Who the hell are you?

02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:40.200
尼克·弗瑞  神盾局局长
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:05:42.170 --> 02:05:44.800
我来跟你谈谈复仇者联盟
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.
