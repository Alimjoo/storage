你就是不想让我来处理  对吗
You couldn't just let me handle this, could you?

11:12.550 --> 11:14.550
你妈妈有可能控制着"锡拉"
Your mother could have scylla.

11:22.420 --> 11:26.940
以前  我们放学的时候 她会烤饼干给我们
She used to bake cookies when we'd come home From school,

11:26.950 --> 11:30.170
在后院和我们一起踢球
Play kickball with us in the backyard.

11:30.180 --> 11:33.320
她不可能是特工
There's just no way that woman was a company agent.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.540
你看了她的资料  对吗
You did read her file, didn't you?

11:37.550 --> 11:39.710
我看了医疗报告
I saw medical reports

11:39.720 --> 11:43.340
上面说她和我做过同样的检查
That said she had the same diagnosis i did

11:43.350 --> 11:48.410
公司的医生也 给她做了手术
And that company doctors operated On her, too.

11:48.420 --> 11:49.970
我一直在想  之后他们是否也带她
Now i'm wondering if they took her off

11:49.980 --> 11:53.810
去了那座小木屋
To a log cabin in the woods after they were done,

11:53.820 --> 11:56.720
给她介绍一个神经科医生
Introduced her to a friendly shrink.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.870
怎么会有人看着自己的孩子
How else could someone just stand by and watch

12:01.880 --> 12:04.250
像落水狗一样让人追杀
Their own children were hunted down like dogs?

12:05.920 --> 12:09.250
可能她不知道
Maybe she didn't know.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.860
她早就知道
She knew.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.580
可能她没办法处理
Maybe it was over her head.

12:16.590 --> 12:19.260
或者她根本不在乎
Or maybe she didn't care.

12:21.060 --> 12:22.380
我只是很惊讶
Anyway, i'm just surprised

12:22.390 --> 12:25.450
将军等了这么长时间  才告诉我们这个秘密
The general waited so long to drop this bomb on us.

12:25.460 --> 12:28.450
其实  我觉得很合情合理
Actually, i think that part makes sense.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.310
不管是什么原因
I mean, for whatever reason,

12:30.320 --> 12:32.380
你妈妈不想让你们知道她还活着
Your mother didn't want you to know she was alive

12:32.390 --> 12:34.780
否则你们可能早就知道了
Or you would have known years ago.

12:34.790 --> 12:37.810
将军只是保守秘密
The general was just keeping that secret, right?

12:37.820 --> 12:41.050
让她高兴  让她卖命
Keeping her happy, keeping her working.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.710
但是  现在情况不同了
But now the game has changed.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.710
他认为现在可以利用你了
Yeah, now he thinks you might be useful.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.320
就像我妈一样
Just like mom.

12:52.260 --> 12:55.680
毫无疑问  他是我接触过的
Beyond question, he possesses the most gifted mind

12:55.690 --> 12:58.110
最天资聪颖的人
Of any man i've ever encountered.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.420
我尽量不带那么多个人情绪
Well, i'll try not to take that too personally.

13:02.460 --> 13:05.150
他钻孔到你的办公室保险箱
He drilled into your office safe

13:05.160 --> 13:09.010
神不知鬼不觉地复制了你的卡
And copied your card without you even noticing.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.210
回想起来  你当时坐在我旁边吧
As I recall, you were sitting right next to me.

13:12.220 --> 13:15.580
如果我们能招纳迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
If we could have turned Michael Scofield,

13:15.590 --> 13:18.590
就能多利用克里斯汀娜30年
It would have been like having 30 more years of Christina.

13:19.220 --> 13:21.760
靠边停下
Pull over.

13:26.190 --> 13:28.450
我的车在那
That's my ride.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.050
怎么了
What's going on?

13:30.060 --> 13:32.260
再见  乔纳森
Good-bye, Jonathan.

14:13.590 --> 14:15.580
不是这里
This isn't the place.

14:15.590 --> 14:16.780
我用假手都能开那种锁
I could pick that lock with my stump.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.980
不  不
No, n-no, n-no.

14:18.990 --> 14:22.380
这就叫表里不一
Remember what they say about books and their covers.

14:22.390 --> 14:24.180
海瑞·温斯顿把希望之星
When Harry Winston donated the hope diamond

14:24.190 --> 14:26.550
捐给史密森尼博物馆时  你知道他怎么
To the smithsonian, you know how he got it from new york

14:26.560 --> 14:28.480
把它从纽约带到华盛顿吗
To dc?

14:28.490 --> 14:30.310
挂号信
Registered mail.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.010
这是最安全的方式
It's the safest way to go.

14:32.020 --> 14:33.810
毕竟  没人会去邮局
After all, who is going to be looking

14:33.820 --> 14:37.010
查找希望之星
For the hope diamond at the post office, right?

14:37.020 --> 14:39.380
又有谁会到小哈瓦那
And who would be looking for scylla

14:39.390 --> 14:40.980
的一个破烂教堂
At some run-down storefront church

14:40.990 --> 14:43.310
-找"锡拉"呢  -就算你说得对
- In little havana?- All right, let's say you're right.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.210
他们把"锡拉"放里面了
They got scylla back there somewhere.

14:45.220 --> 14:47.810
你进去跟臭保安拼命
You walk in there, reeking that cop stink,

14:47.820 --> 14:49.110
坚持不了多久
You won't last a second.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.980
说得对
That's a good point.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.760
所以由你去
That's why you're going in.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.310
能帮您什么吗
May i help you?

15:11.320 --> 15:13.080
是的  事实上
Yes, as a matter of fact.

15:13.090 --> 15:15.050
我是查尔斯·帕特西
I'm Charles Patoshik.

15:15.060 --> 15:17.310
我是南福罗里达大学的
I'm a professor of anthropology

15:17.320 --> 15:19.180
人类学教授
At southern florida university.

15:19.190 --> 15:21.950
我正在研究不同种类的
I'm doing some various research on various different kinds

15:21.960 --> 15:25.050
加勒比宗教
Of, uh, uh, uh, caribbean religions, and, uh...

15:25.060 --> 15:26.310
或许可以
Perhaps you could start

15:26.320 --> 15:30.290
从里面开始
Back there where you, you do your, uh, services.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.180
那是我们的圣堂
That is our sanctuary.

15:33.190 --> 15:36.650
只有纯洁的心灵 方可进入
Only the pure of soul May venture inside.

15:36.660 --> 15:37.650
了解
I know.

15:37.660 --> 15:40.080
我去过很多圣堂
I-i have been in many such rooms.

15:40.090 --> 15:43.690
让我看看你的手
Let me see your hand.

15:56.190 --> 15:58.410
你心灵不纯
Your soul is black,

15:58.420 --> 16:02.010
沾有无辜人的鲜血
Stained with the blood of the innocent.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.850
我不能让你进去
I cannot let you pass.

16:03.860 --> 16:08.790
从来没有人这么冒犯过我
I have never been so offended in my life.

16:12.920 --> 16:16.480
我建议  你去别处
I suggest that you continue your research

16:16.490 --> 16:19.790
继续研究
Elsewhere.

16:27.290 --> 16:30.050
如果是不小心
If you drop something

16:30.060 --> 16:32.780
落下的东西
By accident,

16:32.790 --> 16:35.160
上面肯定会有指纹
You leave a fingerprint on it.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.880
她就想让你发现这个
She wanted you to find this.

16:37.890 --> 16:39.780
-为什么  -你以前看过吗
Why? you ever seen it before?

16:39.790 --> 16:41.610
没有
No.

16:41.620 --> 16:42.610
你还记得
Do you remember

16:42.620 --> 16:43.810
那天的事吗
Anything about that day?

16:43.820 --> 16:45.290
我当时4岁
I was four years old.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.250
记得在哪拍的吗
Any idea where it was taken?

16:48.260 --> 16:51.260
忘了
No.

16:53.490 --> 16:56.250
没事吧
You okay?

16:56.260 --> 16:58.350
-如果我发现我妈妈  -听着
I mean, if i found out my mom was... listen,

16:58.360 --> 17:00.080
就我而言  她不是我妈
As far as i'm concerned, she's not my mom.

17:00.090 --> 17:01.450
只是我自由路上的绊脚石
She's just someone in the way of my freedom.

17:01.460 --> 17:02.820
懂了吗
All right?

17:11.420 --> 17:13.510
我6岁生日时
So, on my sixth birthday,

17:13.520 --> 17:17.550
爸爸已经离开很长时间了
Um, my father was long gone by then,

17:17.560 --> 17:19.850
只剩下我  妈妈   林肯
So it was just me, mom, and linc, and...

17:19.860 --> 17:21.510
妈妈送给我礼物
Mom hands me my present--

17:21.520 --> 17:24.550
我唯一的礼物  我以为...
My, uh, my only present-- and i just know...

17:24.560 --> 17:28.180
我猜那是千年隼号的模型
I just know it's the millennium falcon.

17:28.190 --> 17:29.850
有战斗警报声的吗
With the battle alert sound?

17:29.860 --> 17:30.950
没错
Exactly.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.950
-我有过一样的  -当然
-I totally owned that. -of course you did.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.350
我为这个求了母亲好几个礼拜
Anyway, i had been asking for this thing for weeks,

17:35.360 --> 17:37.510
包装的大小看起来一模一样
And the package is just the right size, and...

17:37.520 --> 17:38.950
我撕下包装
I rip open the wrapping paper

17:38.960 --> 17:42.710
结果却是个鸟巢
And... it's a birdhouse.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.980
不
Oh, no.

17:43.990 --> 17:46.650
其实不算是个鸟巢
Oh, yeah, except it's not even a birdhouse.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.510
是一套鸟巢玩具包
It's actually a birdhouse kit.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.650
真是遗憾
I'm so sorry.

17:50.660 --> 17:54.410
之后两天我都没和她说话
I didn't talk to her for two days after that,

17:54.420 --> 17:57.580
但她最后还是想办法让我开始拼
But when she finally got me to open the thing,

17:57.590 --> 17:59.010
我们坐在一起
We sat there together,

17:59.020 --> 18:00.950
一块一块的拼起来
Put it together piece by piece,

18:00.960 --> 18:03.220
那是我的第一个建筑作品
And it was the first thing i ever built.

18:05.090 --> 18:08.210
我很喜欢它
And i loved it...

18:08.220 --> 18:10.550
她一早就知道我会喜欢上它
And she knew i would.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.910
她比我更加了解我自己
She knew me better than i knew myself.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.850
母亲的天性
That's what moms do.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.550
奇怪的是
Yeah, but the strange thing is...

18:17.560 --> 18:19.410
即使我们有23年没见
Even though i haven't seen her for 23 years,

18:19.420 --> 18:20.480
我仍然能感觉到
There's this part of me

18:20.490 --> 18:25.320
她依然是如此
That feels like maybe she still does.

18:59.590 --> 19:02.480
你的车好像有些超载
Your truck looks a little low to the ground.

19:02.490 --> 19:03.480
介意下车来看看吗
You mind stepping outside?

19:03.490 --> 19:05.580
我刚刚才在20英里外磅重过
I just got weighed 20 miles back.

19:05.590 --> 19:08.420
你是高速公路巡警吗
You highway patrol?

19:10.360 --> 19:12.760
去哪里
Where are you going?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.610
这和你无关
You've got no business in there.

19:26.620 --> 19:27.750
除非你有搜查令
Unless you show me a warrant,

19:27.760 --> 19:30.160
否则马上滚下来
You get the hell out of there right now.

19:40.990 --> 19:42.420
谢谢
Thank you.

19:45.690 --> 19:47.650
上帝
Goodness.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.680
我有磅重点的票据
I got my weigh station ticket

19:49.690 --> 19:51.350
就在我的车上
Right here on the dash.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.420
给你看看
As soon as you see that...

19:54.460 --> 19:56.420
我刚刚才磅过重的
You'll see i got it right here.

19:58.820 --> 20:01.320
给
Here you go.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.350
我要你跟着我回凤凰城
I need you to follow me back to phoenix.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.910
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

20:06.920 --> 20:08.550
我要去达拉斯卸货
I got to get this load to dallas.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.090
这是你自己选的
Well, that's your choice.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.620
找到他们了
I got 'em.

20:36.060 --> 20:39.210
我们该给你哥哥打电话
I think we need to call your brother.

20:39.220 --> 20:40.980
没信号
No signal.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.640
我们肯定在鸟不生蛋的地方
We must be in the middle of nowhere.

20:42.650 --> 20:45.780
林肯说如果公司抓到你的话
Lincoln said that if the company caught you...

20:48.760 --> 20:51.250
我看到这里有个侧门
I think i saw a side door back here.

20:51.260 --> 20:53.250
为何不走正门
What about the main door?

20:53.260 --> 20:54.510
不可能打开了
You'll never get that open.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.410
肯定从外面锁上了
I'm sure it's latched from the outside.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.940
侧门能开吗
Can you open the side door?

20:57.950 --> 21:00.860
也许
Maybe.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.650
莎拉
Sara.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.060
帮我一下
Help me out.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.120
我们搬不动这个
I don't think we're going to be able to move this.

21:22.020 --> 21:24.840
我们不用搬
Maybe we won't have to.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.780
我有个关于克兰兹将军的坏消息
I have troubling news about general krantz.

21:27.790 --> 21:29.180
他还活着
He's alive.

21:29.190 --> 21:31.080
这不可能
I don't see how that's possible.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.680
但我听说有一架
Yes, well, what i'm hearing is a

21:32.690 --> 21:34.280
从公司洛城总部起飞的

正在返回洛城途中
And now it's back in los angeles.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.880
你找到他的尸体了吗
So you got the corpse?

21:43.890 --> 21:46.910
直升机降落在公司总部
The helicopter landed back at company headquarters.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.150
你知道除掉他对我们努力
You know how important getting rid of him is

21:49.160 --> 21:51.010
达到的目标有多重要
To what we're trying to accomplish.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.310
好吧  我可以搞定
All right, I can still get this done.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.020
时间不够了
Not in our time frame.

22:00.090 --> 22:01.750
好吧  我要速战速决
All right, I'm pulling the plug.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.110
我们要着手处理结果了
We need to start dealing with the consequences.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.850
等会儿  关键的是
Wait, wait, wait. first things first.

22:05.860 --> 22:07.250
他知道我已经背叛了他
He knows that i've betrayed him.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.350
我需要消失
I need to disappear.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.550
直觉真敏锐
I think that's a good instinct.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.610
我在森瓦利有间房子
I have a house in Sun Valley.

22:12.620 --> 22:15.010
我还有个主意
I have another idea.

22:15.020 --> 22:17.760
你介意打开扬声器吗
Do you mind putting me on speaker?

22:19.720 --> 22:22.650
格里夫  你是个勇敢的人
You know, Griff, you're a brave man.

22:22.660 --> 22:25.450

照片里的汽车是佛罗里达的牌照
The car in this picture has Florida plates.

22:37.820 --> 22:39.210
你去那儿度过假吗
Did you ever vacation there?

22:39.220 --> 22:40.910
-没有  -你认不认识
- No.  - Do you know anyone

22:40.920 --> 22:43.180
-从那来拜访的人吗  -不认识
- From Forida who came up to visit?  - No.

22:43.190 --> 22:46.690
他们为什么要在那辆车前拍照
Why did they take this picture in front of that car?

22:48.520 --> 22:51.280
我们没有拍过
We didn't.

22:51.290 --> 22:52.680
照片被修改过了
It's been doctored.

22:52.690 --> 22:53.880
这一点我不能肯定
I'm not sure about that.

22:53.890 --> 22:57.340
光线  影子 都处理地很好
I mean, the lighting, the shadows, All sync up perfectly.

22:57.350 --> 22:59.880

This is a '78 zephyr.

你是唯一能想起来的人
You're the only one who could've picked up on that.

23:06.990 --> 23:08.880
这照片是特意为你修改的
She doctored that for you.

23:08.890 --> 23:10.680
看看她还可能修改了什么
Let's see what else she might've changed.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.640
那辆西风的牌照是什么
What's the license plate on that zephyr?

23:12.650 --> 23:16.480
M-I-K 4-4-1
M-I-K 4-4-1.

23:16.490 --> 23:19.140
马丁路德金大道与411道路交叉口处
Martin Luther King boulevard intersects with route 441

23:19.150 --> 23:20.640
大概离这里偏北五英里
About five miles north of here.

23:20.650 --> 23:21.980
很好
Good.

23:21.990 --> 23:23.980
你们在这里  我们在小哈瓦那
You guys are here. listen, we're a little outmanned

23:23.990 --> 23:25.840
人手不够  你们可以支援我们
Down in Little Havana. we could use some backup.

23:25.850 --> 23:27.780
我们有买家的线索
We got a lead on the buyer.

23:27.790 --> 23:29.920
很好  那我们还等什么
Great, what are we waiting for?

23:30.040 --> 23:31.740
我还是自己干吧
I think I gonna do it myself.

23:31.820 --> 23:33.680
我们应该在一起  团队合作嘛
Come on, let's stay together. we're a team, right?

23:33.690 --> 23:35.710
-我说过我能做到  -经过今早的
- I said i got it.  - After our little

23:35.720 --> 23:37.240
小小特殊快递
Special deliveries this morning,

23:37.250 --> 23:38.740
每个人都是平等的了
Each one of us has an equal stake.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.690
无论谁牵的头  我们都要让他们出局
Whoever started this, we're all going to take them out.

23:44.850 --> 23:47.610
我们认为买家是林肯的母亲
The buyer, we think it's Lincoln's mother.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.040
你说什么
What?

23:49.050 --> 23:51.190
正如我所说  我自己干
Like i said, i'm doing this myself.

23:51.950 --> 23:53.040
林肯
Linc!

23:53.050 --> 23:54.910
如果她有"锡拉"
If she has scylla,

23:54.920 --> 23:56.540
她是不会拱手相让的
She's not just going to hand it over

23:56.550 --> 23:58.380
与将军相比是有过之而无不及
Any more than the general would have.

23:58.390 --> 23:59.580
你也不知道
You don't know that.

23:59.590 --> 24:01.280
我们都认为拿着"锡拉"的人
We always thought whoever had scylla

24:01.290 --> 24:02.640
会像将军那样做事
Would do what the general did.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.040
也许她不会
Maybe she won't.

24:04.050 --> 24:05.140
你当真吗
Are you serious?

24:05.150 --> 24:06.980
你妈是公司特工
Your mother is a company agent?

24:06.990 --> 24:08.410
她曾经是
She was.

24:08.420 --> 24:09.780
她现在可能是个好人了
She might be one of the good guys now.

24:09.790 --> 24:11.140
恕我直言
With all due respect,

24:11.150 --> 24:12.780
我觉得你没有把握
I don't think you're in a place where you can make

24:12.790 --> 24:14.410
断定这点
A clear determination about that.

24:14.420 --> 24:17.540
这个MLK 441可能什么也不是
Listen, this MLK 441 could be nothing.

24:17.550 --> 24:18.610
但在那座教堂里
But at the church,

24:18.620 --> 24:20.120
可能会有"锡拉"
There could be scylla.

24:21.490 --> 24:23.250
如果需要你帮助  我会打电话
If i need you, i'll call.

24:24.950 --> 24:27.290
这应该管用
This should work.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.940
克里斯汀娜
Christina?

24:53.950 --> 24:55.570
你有必要知道在过去24小时中
You need to acknowledge that our chance

24:55.580 --> 24:58.240
我们成功的几率大大降低了
Of success has substantially declined in the last 24 hours.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.940
有人在追查我们
There are people out looking for us.

24:59.950 --> 25:02.140
要开始考虑退路了
We need to start thinking in terms of contingencies.

25:02.150 --> 25:04.940
再等等  就几天
Just a little while longer, only a few more days.

25:04.950 --> 25:06.810
克兰兹将军面对严重威胁时
General Krantz refused to adjust

25:06.820 --> 25:08.470
也拒绝调整
When there were credible threats against him.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.880
所以我们才夺取"锡拉"
That's the reason we have scylla now.

25:11.890 --> 25:15.850
你不会拿我和他相提并论吧
Are you honestly comparing me to him?

25:16.890 --> 25:21.440
我知道在整件事中你给自己的定位
I understand what you think your role is in all of this,

25:21.450 --> 25:23.080
也很感谢你的努力
And I appreciate your efforts.

25:23.090 --> 25:24.540
但如果你觉得
But if you can't tell the difference

25:24.550 --> 25:26.540
我和他一样  你就去找将军
Between he and I, perhaps you need to ask

25:26.550 --> 25:29.320
要回你的职位
The general for your old job back.

25:32.090 --> 25:33.940
瞧
Oh, look.

25:33.950 --> 25:37.720
是他打的  你想接吗
Here he is. would you like to take the call?

25:41.850 --> 25:43.440
乔纳森
Jonathan.

25:43.450 --> 25:45.040
下午好  克里斯汀娜
Good afternoon, Christina.

25:45.050 --> 25:46.410
听到你的声音真高兴
It's good to hear your voice.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.840
我想这意味着你找到"锡拉"了
I assume this means you've retrieved scylla.

25:48.850 --> 25:50.010
还没
Not yet.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.940
真糟糕
Oh, troubling news.

25:51.950 --> 25:53.780
知道它在哪吗
Have any idea where it is?

25:53.790 --> 25:55.410
你在哪  克里斯汀娜
Where are you, Christina?

25:55.420 --> 25:58.310
约翰内斯堡  我还能在哪呢
Johannesburg. where else would I be?

25:58.320 --> 25:59.910
我让附近的部下
I've had some of my contacts

25:59.920 --> 26:01.680
到你家去查看
In your area check on your house.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.140
家里没有人
There's no one home.

26:03.150 --> 26:05.340
当然没有  没找到"锡拉"
Well, of course not. as long as scylla's in play,

26:05.350 --> 26:07.820
那个地址就是假的
That address is blown.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.510
你在哪  克里斯汀娜
Where are you, Christina?

26:11.520 --> 26:13.710
我不喜欢你的语气  乔纳森
I don't like your tone, jonathan.

26:13.720 --> 26:14.910
如果语气不好
Excuse me

26:14.920 --> 26:17.440
请原谅
If I sound a bit abrasive.

26:17.450 --> 26:20.610
但刚刚有人想杀我
But it's been a while since anyone's tried to kill me.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.470
天哪
Oh, my god.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.200
你没事吧  发生什么事了
Are you all right? what happened?

26:24.210 --> 26:26.200
鄂伦
Oren.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.770
鄂伦
"Oren"?

26:27.780 --> 26:30.770
我们找到了他的尸体  他杀
We found his body... executed.

26:30.780 --> 26:33.840
我只能想到他是和别人共事的
I can only assume that he's working with someone.

26:33.850 --> 26:35.740
某个不用承受失败的人
Someone who doesn't tolerate failure.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.010
你到底在哪  克里斯汀娜
Now, where are you, Christina?

26:38.020 --> 26:39.940
你听我说
You listen to me.

26:39.950 --> 26:42.840
如果你想说我和这事有关
If you're implying that I had anything to do with this...

26:42.850 --> 26:45.050
你在哪里
Where are you?

26:45.060 --> 26:49.060
我为公司付出了这么多  我丈夫  孩子
After everything i've given to the compeny. My husband, my children...

26:49.070 --> 26:51.710
我想是时候我们坐下来
I think it's time that we had a sit-down.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.910
-好好谈谈  -我告诉你
- And talk.  - Tell you what.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.470
干嘛不召集你的亲信
Why don't you gether up the brain trust,

26:56.480 --> 27:00.140
你的笨女儿和病态情人
That half-witted daughter and your psychotic mistress?

27:00.150 --> 27:03.010
召集起来想想锡拉的去向
Why don't you get together and figure out where scylla is?

27:03.020 --> 27:04.650
然后再打给我
Then call me.

27:38.220 --> 27:39.850
布伦斯先生
Mr. Burrows.

27:46.750 --> 27:49.580
我能带您去您的座位吗
May I escort you to your table?

28:15.120 --> 28:17.320
你一点都没变
You haven't changed a bit.

28:24.950 --> 28:26.840
很高兴你收到了我的信息
I'm glad you got my message.

28:26.850 --> 28:28.870
我知道这不是最直接的交流方式
I know it wasn't the most straightforward

28:28.880 --> 28:31.340
但我要确定那是你
Mode of communication, but I had to be sure it was you.

28:31.350 --> 28:34.720
至少我知道迈克尔怎么得到的
At least now I know where Michael gets it from.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.070
你肯定有很多问题想问
I'm sure you have many questions.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.010
"锡拉"在哪
Where's scylla?

28:43.220 --> 28:45.140
它很安全
It's safe.

28:45.150 --> 28:47.040
现在我只能说这么多
That's all I can tell you for right now.

28:47.050 --> 28:48.840
那我们就没什么可说的了
Then we've got nothing to talk about.

28:48.850 --> 28:50.610
真的吗
Really?

28:50.620 --> 28:52.410
你来就是为了这个吗
That's the only reason you came here?

28:52.420 --> 28:55.040
对
Yeah.

28:55.050 --> 28:57.870
我一直以为你想知道真相
I really would've thought you wanted to know the truth.

28:57.880 --> 28:58.710
我已经知道了
I know the truth.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.040
你为公司效力
You work for the company.

29:01.050 --> 29:03.310
那群用谋杀案陷害我的家伙
The same people that set me up for murder.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.570
-林肯  -还是那群人
- Lincoln...  - The same people

29:04.580 --> 29:06.610
自从我们从福克斯河监狱越狱之后
That have been trying to kill me and Michael

29:06.620 --> 29:09.350
就一直追杀我和迈克尔
Ever since we escaped Fox River.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.820
你可以随便猜测  但我不是个恶魔
You can think it as much as you want, I'm not a monster.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.440
23年过去了  你连道歉都没有
23 years and not even an apology?

29:20.450 --> 29:23.610
如果道歉可以管用的话
If I thought an apology would do any good,

29:23.620 --> 29:25.450
我肯定会道歉
I would offer it.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.140
求你了
Please.

29:32.150 --> 29:34.520
请你坐下
Please sit down.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.270
抛弃你们兄弟俩
Leaving you two boys...

29:47.280 --> 29:49.840
是我这辈子最艰难的决定
Was the hardest thing I ever did.

29:49.850 --> 29:51.870
你还是做了
But you did.

29:52.020 --> 29:54.490
你一走了之去为公司效力
And then you went off and worked for the company.

29:55.620 --> 29:58.180
你以为你了解那个公司
You know, you think you know what the company is,

29:58.190 --> 29:59.250
实际上你根本不了解
But you don't.

29:59.260 --> 30:03.510
公司的意志是受首脑控制的
It is a body that bends to the will of its head.

30:03.520 --> 30:07.310
它现在既好战又嗜血
And right now, it is bloodthirsty and war-hungry,

30:07.320 --> 30:10.360
因为克兰兹将军就是这种人
Because that's who General Krantz is.

30:11.660 --> 30:12.980
但如果一个女人
But what if a woman,

30:12.990 --> 30:16.710
一位母亲掌管公司
A mother, ran it?

30:16.720 --> 30:19.180
你能想象会有多大的改变吗
Can you imagine the different that would make?

30:19.190 --> 30:20.610
你以为你是位母亲
You think you're a mother?

30:20.620 --> 30:24.550
母亲的首要职责 是照顾家庭
A mother's priority Is her family.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.880
如果我把"锡拉"给将军  他就会
If I give scylla back to the general, he leaves me

30:26.890 --> 30:28.750
放过我和迈克尔  我就可以多花些时间
And Michael alone, and I get to spend time

30:28.760 --> 30:30.620
安安静静地陪我儿子
With my son in peace.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.480
要向你解释我为什么这么做  做了什么
Look, I could sit here for days and try to explain to you

30:34.490 --> 30:36.610
可能花上几天时间
Why I did what I did.

30:36.620 --> 30:38.810
简单地说  我就不能保护你了
Suffice it to say, I couldn't protect you then,

30:38.820 --> 30:42.160
但是现在请让我保护你
But let me protect you now.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.140
如果克兰兹将军死了
What if general Krantz were no longer in the picture?

30:46.150 --> 30:48.540
一旦解决了他
Once he is dealt with,

30:48.550 --> 30:51.970
就没有人再追杀你们了
No one would come after you.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.840
但是我需要时间  林肯
But I need time, Lincoln.

30:53.850 --> 30:55.210
我需要两天时间
I need two days

30:55.220 --> 30:56.770
去把一切安排妥当
To put everything into place.

30:56.780 --> 30:58.980
如果你能给我两天时间
If you give me two days...

31:00.320 --> 31:02.470
我就能让你和迈克尔
...then I can give you and Michael

31:02.480 --> 31:04.720
拥有充分彻底的自由
Your complete and utter freedom.

31:13.980 --> 31:15.750
好吧
All right.

31:17.850 --> 31:19.070
好吧
All right.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.570
我现在就开始动手
I'm going to get started right away.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.640
如果克兰兹产生怀疑的话
But if Krantz suspects any of this,

31:22.650 --> 31:25.740
他不会放过我们俩的
He's going to hunt us both down.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.640
正因如此
And for that reason,

31:28.650 --> 31:31.170
在一切办完之前
I can't risk being seen with you

31:31.180 --> 31:33.350
不能让人发现你我见面了
Until all of this is over.

31:34.180 --> 31:36.040
那我怎么联系你
How will I get in touch with you?

31:36.050 --> 31:38.810
你不能联系我
You can't.

31:38.820 --> 31:40.820
对不起
I'm sorry.

32:06.180 --> 32:07.970
只要把这个箱子拉倒
Once we pull this box down,

32:07.980 --> 32:09.170
就能压倒售水机
It'll push the water machine

32:09.180 --> 32:10.610
撞开侧门
Right through the side door.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.410
车子减速了  我们肯定下了高速公路
We're slowing down. I think we're getting off the highway.

32:12.420 --> 32:14.480
快弄好了
I'm almost ready.

32:16.980 --> 32:18.850
莎拉  抓住那边的带子
Sara, grab that strap over there.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.380
好的  抓住
All right, hold it.

32:37.530 --> 32:38.950
快点
Come on!

32:56.820 --> 32:58.720
你没事吧
You all right?

33:20.020 --> 33:21.510
你解决那个区域之后
After you clear the area

33:21.520 --> 33:22.870
我就不会遇到任何阻碍了
I don't anticipate any problems.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.870
懂了吗
All right?

33:24.880 --> 33:26.010
放手一搏了
Scylla or not here we come.

33:26.020 --> 33:27.450
好的  等等
All right. hold on.

33:31.020 --> 33:35.110
这些人要干什么
What the hell are those guys doing?

33:36.280 --> 33:39.270
我们无法对付更多人
We're not going against any additional people in there.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.110
-等他们出来  -好的
- We wait until they come back out.  - All right.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.220
林肯的妈妈真的是买家吗
So Lincoln's mother is really the buyer?

33:49.190 --> 33:50.950
看来是的
It appears that way.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.210
我希望他能理解
I hope he understands,

33:52.220 --> 33:55.210
如果需要除掉她才能拿到锡拉
That if I need to take her out to get to scylla,

33:55.220 --> 33:57.210
我会毫不犹豫地杀了她
I'm not going to hesitate to kill her.

33:57.220 --> 33:58.710
同意
No question.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.680
希望不要走到这步
Well, let's just hope it doesn't come to that.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.910
你说真的吗
You serious?

34:02.920 --> 34:04.780
我认真的  如果不用杀掉林肯的妈妈
Yeah. am I serious if we can get scylla

34:04.790 --> 34:05.950
就能拿到锡拉的话
Without killing Linc's mother,

34:05.960 --> 34:07.750
这样更好
That's the preferable outcome.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.050
等等
Wait a second.

34:09.060 --> 34:10.850
如果我要和你一起深入虎穴
If I'm gonna be in the foxhole with you,

34:10.860 --> 34:13.260
我要知道你真的能帮我
I need to know that you have my back.

34:17.060 --> 34:19.910
东西在布伦斯夫人手里
Mrs. Burrows has the item,

34:19.920 --> 34:21.350
拿到它的唯一方法就是杀了她
And the only way to get it is to kill her.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.760
你打算怎么做
