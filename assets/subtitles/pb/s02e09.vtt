Previously on Prison Break

00:02.630 --> 00:05.090
女士们  打搅一下  我有几个问题想问你
Excuse me,ladies,I need to ask you a few questions.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.650
再是那个邋遢的南方人
And then that dirty Southerner,

00:06.660 --> 00:08.350
他鬼鬼祟祟地从后门走的
he snuck out the back.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.620
你真的认为那个恋童癖卷走了所有的钱?
Do you really think the diaper sniper got all of it?

00:10.630 --> 00:12.290
如果换作你是帝博格
If you were Bagwell,

00:12.300 --> 00:13.790
手上有500万现钞
and you just got your hands on $5 million,

00:13.800 --> 00:15.950
你会去哪?
where would you go?

00:15.960 --> 00:17.090
好的 听着
All right,listen,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.190
在彩虹轩
in the Rainbow Room.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.650
那是纽约的一家餐厅
Restaurant in New York City.

00:19.660 --> 00:22.890
我会在那里等着你
I am gonna be waiting in that spot.

00:22.900 --> 00:26.720
你和女儿能在那里等着我
And that's all that I want... in this whole world,

00:26.730 --> 00:30.530
就是我所期盼的全部了
is for my two girls to be waiting there for me.

00:36.030 --> 00:37.020
凯莉 福斯特
Kelly Foster

00:37.030 --> 00:40.730
三个点 第三个字母

00:41.730 --> 00:43.390
(rendezvous:碰头地点)

00:43.400 --> 00:45.390
问题是地点会在哪
Question is "where"?

00:45.400 --> 00:47.190
日落
Sundown

00:47.200 --> 00:49.490
迈克儿  什么意思? 你到底想要告诉我什么?
What? What are you trying to tell me,Michael?

00:49.500 --> 00:51.720
我想我欠你一个道歉
I think I owe you an apology.

00:51.730 --> 00:54.920
因为我对你撒了个谎
Because I lied to you.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.450
关于奥斯卡  沙尔斯的事
About Oscar Shales.

00:56.460 --> 00:58.250
就在那儿
Right there.

00:58.260 --> 01:02.550
我就是在这枪毙了他
That's where I put the bullet in him.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.490
你要做什么?
What are you doing,man?

01:05.500 --> 01:06.890
你只是受雇办事的
You've been hired to do a job.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.250
理由不关你的事
The reasoning... does not concern you.

01:10.260 --> 01:12.520
不要问关于我们的事
You don't ask any questions about us,

01:12.530 --> 01:14.220
这样或许我们能继续保证不再有人调查你
maybe we'll continue to make sure no one asks any questions about you.

01:14.230 --> 01:17.630
明白了吗?
Are we clear?

01:17.760 --> 01:21.550
全部都得死
They all die.

01:21.560 --> 01:25.060
布兰丁植物园
blanding botanical gardens

01:48.560 --> 01:52.060
晚班经理: 吉米  马丹

Are you new?

01:58.100 --> 02:00.120

02:00.130 --> 02:02.420
没人告诉过我会有新志愿者加入
No one told me we were getting a new volunteer.

02:02.430 --> 02:04.450
我一直在这工作的
I've been working,uh,

02:04.460 --> 02:06.520
上晚班做清洁工还有...

02:06.530 --> 02:09.420
吉米说我可以换日班  所以...
Jimmy said I could change my shift,so...

02:09.430 --> 02:11.120
你知道你要干什么吗?
You know what you're doin'?

02:11.130 --> 02:14.290
知道
Yeah.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.390
我四处看一圈
I'll see you around.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.800
好的
Right.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.800
阿帕奇沙漠之魅
apache desert ghost

03:16.660 --> 03:19.000
-可能是斯科菲尔德 -收到

You take that side.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.320

Freeze!

04:30.330 --> 04:31.750
别开枪
Take it easy,man.

04:31.760 --> 04:34.890
-呆在地上别动 -发生什么事?
What's the deal?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.100
他跑了
He's gone.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.720
你还好吧?
How you feelin'?

04:43.730 --> 04:45.590
算是吧
Okay,I guess.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.820
有点疲惫
Tired.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.350
孩子 我是他们的目标
I'm a target,kid.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.520
只要你和我在一起 你也是他们的目标
As long as you're with me,so are you.

04:53.530 --> 04:56.790
事情在转好之前会变得更糟
Things could get a lot worse before they get better.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.950
你明白吗?
You understand?

04:57.960 --> 05:00.020
但是我们碰上迈克儿叔叔 然后取道巴拿马...
But after we meet up with Uncle Mike and get to Panama...

05:00.030 --> 05:02.720
取道巴拿马不是万全之策 你叔叔的计划有风险
Panama ain't a sure thing,your uncle's plan is dangerous.

05:02.730 --> 05:06.300
我是说真的很危险
I mean really dangerous.

05:06.530 --> 05:07.990
听着
Listen...

05:08.000 --> 05:10.020
所有针对你的指控都被推翻了
all the charges against you have been dropped;

05:10.030 --> 05:12.120
你现在是清白之身 可以开始一段新生活
you're free and clear  to start a new life.

05:12.130 --> 05:13.990
一段美好的生活
A good life.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.090
而非终日四处奔波提心吊胆...
Not be constantly running,looking over your shoulder...

05:16.100 --> 05:19.450
你想要我离开?
You want me to leave?

05:19.460 --> 05:23.530
不是
No.

05:24.130 --> 05:26.090

No.

05:26.100 --> 05:29.000
很好 我也不会离开的
Good,'cause I'm not.

05:40.530 --> 05:42.720
詹妮  电视机开响点
Turn the sound up on the tube,Jenny.

05:42.730 --> 05:44.450
贝丝  威尔逊芝加哥公报报道
Beth Wilson,Chicago Gazette.

05:44.460 --> 05:48.120
你对的大卫  阿克斯死有何看法?
Do you have any thoughts on the death of David Apolskis?

05:48.130 --> 05:49.550
非常不幸
It was unfortunate.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.890
-验尸表明他是被近距离射杀的 -哦 可怜的大卫
Tests show he was shot at close range. Oh,David.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.120
我想提醒你的是
Was there any opportunity to subdue him

05:53.130 --> 05:54.490
难道就不能制服他吗
... Let me remind you that

05:54.500 --> 05:57.020
尽管大卫  阿克斯的年纪不大
despite his age,David "Tweener" Apolskis

05:57.030 --> 06:00.390
但他是个逃犯并扑过来抢我的枪
was a fugitive who made a move for my weapon.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.990
我并不想朝他开枪
I did not want to have to kill him,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.650
但是有时候你会无法控制事态
but sometimes things happen that are just out of your control.

06:05.660 --> 06:08.850
那个勇敢的男孩难不成把你们都干了?
That good ole boy's huntin' 'em all down,ain't he?

06:08.860 --> 06:10.820
马宏先生 有人暴料说你已恢复了斯科菲尔德的硬盘
Mr. Mahone,sources claim that you've recovered Scofield's hard drive

06:10.830 --> 06:13.150
并从中获得大量信息
and have obtained substantial data from it.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.290
哪来的消息?
What sources?

06:14.300 --> 06:16.720
据其所述 你已获取有关斯科菲尔德如何越狱
Allegedly you've retrieved information detailing not only how Scofield broke out,

06:16.730 --> 06:18.320
及出狱后的计划等详尽信息
but how he plans to stay out.

06:18.330 --> 06:19.650
-介意评价一下此事吗? -无可奉告
Care to comment? No.

06:19.660 --> 06:22.550
今天早些时候布兰丁植物园事件
The event at Blanding Botanical Gardens earlier today,

06:22.560 --> 06:24.850
就是你从硬盘中取得信息的收获吧
that was a result of hard-drive data you collected.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.200
无可奉告
No comment.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.490
你已经找到斯科菲尔德会去的其他地方
You found other locations where Scofield might be headed?

06:29.500 --> 06:30.850
-这是真的吗? -还是那句话"无可奉告"
True? I believe I said no comment.

06:30.860 --> 06:32.620
这个家伙似乎已经知道
There's something about this guy,

06:32.630 --> 06:35.090
我们会去哪  我们怎么计划的
it's like he knows where we're going,what we're thinking.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.320
马宏先生 能否透露一下你下一步怎么走?
Mr. Mahone,could you tell us where you're headed next?

06:37.330 --> 06:39.090
硬盘在调查过程中会起什么作用?
What role will the hard drive play in your search?

06:39.100 --> 06:40.890
调查工作的具体进展
The details of this investigation

06:40.900 --> 06:43.320
是极度保密并且日后也是如此
are extremely confidential and will remain so.

06:43.330 --> 06:46.090
实验室归来 有什么发现吗?
Heard it came back from the lab,any findings?

06:46.100 --> 06:48.990
3200安瓿的硝化甘油(炸药)
Yeah,3,200 nitroglycerine ampules.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.820
斯科菲尔德知道这些东西需存放在阴冷潮湿之处
Scofield knew these needed to be stored in a cool,moist area.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.820
犹他州沙漠里最好的存放点就是植物园
Best place for that in the Utah desert is the Botanical Gardens.

06:54.830 --> 06:56.590
这东西稳定吗?
It's stable?

06:56.600 --> 07:00.490
按照心脏病人医用单位的话很安全
All medical grade,safely used by heart patients all the time.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.950
但是聚合在一起...
But in the aggregate...

07:01.960 --> 07:03.550
那个盒子足够
It could take out an entire building.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.920
炸毁整幢大楼
That box right there.

07:05.930 --> 07:08.750
这就是我们不能从这间办公室
This is why we can't have...

07:08.760 --> 07:13.050
泄漏丁点信息的原因
leaks...coming from this office.

07:13.060 --> 07:16.920
上帝保佑那个
God help the agent

07:16.930 --> 07:21.530
在我背后泄密给媒体的探员
who goes behind my back and talks to the press.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.550
能否详细阐述下这次追捕行动的策略?
Can you elaborate on any of your tactics in this manhunt?

07:31.560 --> 07:33.420
孙子云
Sun Tzu said,that if you know your enemy,

07:33.430 --> 07:34.990
知己知彼百战不殆
you need not fear a hundred battles.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.290
我了解那些逃犯
I know these men--

07:36.300 --> 07:38.220
他们是谁 他们来自哪 他们想去哪
who they are,where they came from,where they want to go.

07:38.230 --> 07:41.860
犹他州 莫阿布镇
Moab,Utah

07:42.830 --> 07:48.420
那段名言是亘古有效的
these xxx are in a constant battle.

07:48.430 --> 07:53.560
不仅仅对我 也对逃犯
not only with me, but with themselves.

07:54.830 --> 07:57.000
预测他们做出的每个决定
second guessing of every decision they make,

07:59.830 --> 08:05.460
往左转 还是往右转
do i turn left,do i turn right.

08:05.830 --> 08:09.460
停下还是离开
stay or go.

08:10.830 --> 08:12.850
我的工作就是来解开这些谜团
my job is to know how they'll answer these questions

08:12.860 --> 08:14.790
(前妻: 帕姆  马宏  住址: 西大街90号)

08:14.800 --> 08:15.750
打赢这场追捕战的唯一途径
The only way to win a war

08:15.760 --> 08:17.690
就是彻底了解你的抓捕对象
is to try to know your prey completely

08:17.700 --> 08:19.190
然后用你所掌握得一切信息
and then you get to go after your enemy

08:19.200 --> 08:20.500
再去追捕敌人
with everything you've got.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.020
我们半价商品在后面
Our half-priced stuff is in the back.

09:03.030 --> 09:05.790
我在找一些非常特别的东西
I'm looking for something very specific.

09:05.800 --> 09:10.000
那好吧
Okay.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.090
就是这个
This is it.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.120
这正是我想要的
This is exactly what I need.

09:16.130 --> 09:19.490
很好
Great.

09:19.500 --> 09:23.890
我们今天差之毫厘
We were just inches away today,inches.

09:23.900 --> 09:24.850
我想把这些放大
I want these blown up,huge.

09:24.860 --> 09:26.490
挂在我办公室的墙上
Put them in my office on the walls.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.490
这些是什么?
What are these?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.990
里面有斯科菲尔德约定的碰头地点信息
Somewhere in there is information regarding a rendezvous that Scofield set up,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.790
我们现在就把那地点破译出来
and we're going to crack that code today.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.950
兰! 今天是富兰克林和他妻子相约
Lang! Today's the day Franklin told his wife

09:33.960 --> 09:35.990
-在彩虹轩见面的日子 -没错
he's going to meet her at the Rainbow Room. That's right.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.790
错了 今天是富兰克林归案之日
Wrong. Today's the day Franklin's going down.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.090
你准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

09:39.100 --> 09:42.400
一切都安排妥当了
Everything's arranged.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.400
芝加哥 伊利诺斯州
Chicago,Illinois

10:00.630 --> 10:02.200
都在这了?
It's all here?

10:07.660 --> 10:11.420
嘿 老兄?
Hey,yo,D. Wassup,baby?

10:11.430 --> 10:13.290
我知道肯定就是你
I know that ain't you.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.050
像鬼魅般浮现
Ain't a ghost,man.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.550
你还好吧?
You holding up all right?

10:17.560 --> 10:18.720
转乘了n辆车
Yeah. Just catching a whole bunch of buses

10:18.730 --> 10:20.720
终于到这了
just to get here to Chi-town,man.

10:20.730 --> 10:23.090

How you think I'm supposed to feel?

10:23.100 --> 10:25.720

10:25.730 --> 10:27.190

要苗条很快就可以
Slim-Fast,baby.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.790
是吗?
Is that what it is,huh?

10:29.800 --> 10:32.150
那帮条子一直在调查你老婆 绝没有开玩笑
The Feds been in your old lady's business,no joke.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.590
翻入栅栏调查  还时常跟踪她
Up in your crib,and  following her around sometimes.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.990
这我都知道
Yeah,I know,man. I know.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.850
我知道你深爱着凯茜
Yo,I know you love Kacee,

10:37.860 --> 10:39.950
但我不认为你跑来这是个好主意
but I don't know if it's a good idea for you to be coming around here.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.150
你是个通缉犯
You're a wanted man.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.950
我被通缉是因为我紧闭牙关
I'm wanted because I kept my mouth shut,

10:42.960 --> 10:44.620
没有把你给吐出来
and I kept you out of Fox River.

10:44.630 --> 10:45.920
我们很清楚这点
See,man,we feel that,

10:45.930 --> 10:47.390
欠你个人情
and we owe you one.

10:47.400 --> 10:51.320
很好 我现在就想要回那人情
Good,'cause I'm collecting right now.

10:51.330 --> 10:53.790
今天我老婆就等着我
My wife is waiting for me today,

10:53.800 --> 10:56.490
我不会舍弃家庭独自离开芝加哥 明白吗?
and I am not leaving Chi-town without my family. You understand?

10:56.500 --> 10:58.750
现在我需要你们的帮助
Now,y'all going to help me.

10:58.760 --> 11:02.400
我们动身吧
Let's roll out.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.600
你去哪里?
Where you going?

11:17.430 --> 11:19.990
送小孩上学去
Take my kid to school.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.820
我知道彩虹轩的事
I know about the Rainbow Room.

11:21.830 --> 11:23.550
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:23.560 --> 11:24.820
电话都被监控着
Phone lines are tapped.

11:24.830 --> 11:27.920
我们完整地监听了你和丈夫间的对话
We heard your entire telephone conversation with your husband.

11:27.930 --> 11:30.490
因为你和迪迪都没有预定去纽约的航班
And,since you and Dede aren't booked on any flights to New York,

11:30.500 --> 11:32.790
别告诉我彩虹轩就是曼哈顿的那个餐厅
don't tell me the Rainbow Room is a restaurant in Manhattan.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.220
你现在可以交待和丈夫在哪碰头了
Now,you can tell me where you're meeting your husband,

11:35.230 --> 11:39.750
不然我现在就当着你女儿的面拘捕你
or I can arrest you right in front of your daughter.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.990
你去死吧
You go to hell.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.150
我什么也没有做错
I haven't done anything wrong.

11:43.160 --> 11:48.150
你和一个在逃犯通电话约定今天见面
You spoke with an escaped felon about meeting him today.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.450
你的所作所为足够
You've already done enough

11:49.460 --> 11:51.190
控告你企图协助逃犯
to be charged with attempt to aid and abet.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.920
求你了好吗?  听我说

21:49.060 --> 21:50.820
仅仅是因为有一点磨损
if they even got scuffed.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.420

But he'd be out there all covered in dirt

21:53.430 --> 21:55.120
身边围满了一大包一大包

21:55.130 --> 21:57.790

我们才刚铺的新草坪
We'd just put this new sod in

22:00.430 --> 22:03.390
他就这么翻开来  又放了个新花坛在上面
and he just tore it all up and planted a flower bed.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.150
有一次我回来找他谈这事
And I went out back once to talk to him

22:06.160 --> 22:10.020

22:10.030 --> 22:13.350

22:13.360 --> 22:18.360

22:23.430 --> 22:25.450
我只是想听听他的解释
All I wanted was an explanation

22:25.460 --> 22:27.790
为什么事情就草草收场了
why things ended so suddenly.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.650
而亚力克斯给我的答复就是
And all Alex could say was

22:30.660 --> 22:37.500
有时候你会无法控制事态的发展
"Sometimes things happen that are just out of your control."

22:39.000 --> 22:42.730
抱歉
Excuse me.

23:02.030 --> 23:04.420
那么你女儿房里的照片
So the picture in your daughter's bedroom--

23:04.430 --> 23:06.190
就是这里拍的
the exact location where it was taken

23:06.200 --> 23:07.790
就那个旋转木马  对吗?
was a merry-go-round,right?

23:07.800 --> 23:09.620
是的
Yeah.

23:09.630 --> 23:12.620
那你要做的就是在旋转木马那里等着
So,all you have to do is wait by the merry-go-round.

23:12.630 --> 23:17.260
本杰明就等你出现在那儿
Right where Benjamin's expecting you.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.450
有必要动枪吗?
Is that necessary?

23:19.460 --> 23:20.590
我是说  本杰明并不是...
I mean,Benjamin is not...

23:20.600 --> 23:24.600
只是为了以防万一
It's precautionary.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.090
听着  我这么做
Look,I do this,

23:27.100 --> 23:30.750
你要放过我和我的孩子
you leave me and my child alone.

23:30.760 --> 23:35.560
一言为定
You have my word.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.950
我妻子到了吗?
Is my wife there?

23:56.960 --> 23:58.920
是的她在
Yeah,she's here.

23:58.930 --> 24:02.330
那么我们过去接她
Well,let's go get her.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.220
15秒后
In 15 seconds,

24:29.230 --> 24:31.620
一辆黑色吉普会停在
a black Jeep is going to pull up

24:31.630 --> 24:33.050
停车场入口
by the parking lot's entrance.

24:33.060 --> 24:36.190
跑过去
Run to it.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.330
克里斯?
Chris?

24:40.760 --> 24:43.090
快去!
Go!

24:43.100 --> 24:44.490
不行!
I can't.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.150
他们要去抓迪迪
They're going to take Dede.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.090
不会的!
Look,no,they won't.

24:47.100 --> 24:49.250
那家伙是在和她说话吗?
Is that guy talking to her?

24:49.260 --> 24:50.790
找人读他的口形
Get a read on him.

24:50.800 --> 24:54.730
听着  都办好了  快走!
Look,it's taken care of. Go!

24:58.230 --> 25:01.930
走啊!
Go!

25:04.830 --> 25:06.490
她跑了!
She's running!

25:06.500 --> 25:10.260
快追!  快!  快！
Go,go,go,go,go,move,move!

25:20.960 --> 25:21.820
快进来!
Get in!

25:21.830 --> 25:26.130
坐稳了!
Hold on!

25:35.200 --> 25:36.890
目标是一辆2007款黑色吉普.
It's a 2007 black Jeep.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.390
牌照摘掉了
License plates have been removed.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.790
我们开始追击  方向...
We're in pursuit headed...

25:39.800 --> 25:43.400
不!
No!

25:49.060 --> 25:50.890
把车开走
Move the truck. (speaking Spanish)

25:50.900 --> 25:55.430
把车开走! 我说了开走!
Move the truck! I said move it!

25:58.860 --> 26:00.920
我的孩子在哪儿?
Where is my child?

26:00.930 --> 26:03.450
这儿
Here.

26:03.460 --> 26:04.650
迪迪?
Dede?

26:04.660 --> 26:06.250
是我  宝贝儿
Hey,it's me,baby.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.520
听着  我想跟你说
Look,I just want to tell you

26:08.530 --> 26:10.490
一切都会没事的
that everything is going to be okay.

26:10.500 --> 26:11.990
我们马上要全家团员了
We're going to be a family again.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.120
我向你保证
I promise you that.

26:13.130 --> 26:14.120
迪迪在哪儿?
Where is Dede?

26:14.130 --> 26:15.790
他说你接到她了!
He said that you had her!

26:15.800 --> 26:17.190
放松点  宝贝儿
Whoa,whoa. Easy,baby.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.350
镇静点
Easy.

26:18.360 --> 26:22.960
达里斯正在学校里接她
Darius is picking her up from school right now.

26:23.130 --> 26:24.890
迪迪 富兰克林  道森小学
Dede Franklin,Dawson Elementary--

26:24.900 --> 26:26.720
马上把她从学校带走!
I want her pulled from school now!

26:26.730 --> 26:29.190
到底出什么事了  伙计?
What the hell is going on,man?

26:29.200 --> 26:30.820
他们说她在考试
They say she's taking a test,man,

26:30.830 --> 26:34.100
但我觉得他们在拖延时间...
but I think they're stalling.

26:36.030 --> 26:38.150
那关于...
What about,um...

26:38.160 --> 26:40.990
关于奥斯卡  沙尔斯呢?
What about Oscar Shales?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.150
奥斯卡  沙尔斯?
Oscar Shales?

26:42.160 --> 26:46.200
他很重要吗?
Why is he important?

26:46.660 --> 26:48.690
恩  他...
Well,he's,uh...

26:48.700 --> 26:52.520
他是唯一一个从你前夫手上
he's the only fugitive to ever successfully elude your,uh...

26:52.530 --> 26:55.050
成功逃脱的罪犯
your ex-husband.

26:55.060 --> 26:56.990
亚力克斯因为追捕他而筋疲力尽
Alex was consumed with finding him.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.890
我是说在沙尔斯犯下那些罪行之后
I mean,after what Shales did to all of his victims,

26:59.900 --> 27:01.250
他已经这么投入了  谁会去怪他呢?
who could blame him?

27:01.260 --> 27:04.620
他整整一年都在办那个案子
It was all he worked on,all he did for a year.

27:04.630 --> 27:07.020
但我不认为是那个给他压力
But I don't think that it was the stress

27:07.030 --> 27:08.950
不是因为追捕查尔斯
of chasing Shales that caused Alex

27:08.960 --> 27:10.590
才让他行为举止变的怪异
to start behaving erratically.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.750
为什么这么说呢?
Why is that?

27:11.760 --> 27:15.220
因为他是在这案子已经平静了之后才变了的
Because Alex changed  after the trail went cold.

27:15.230 --> 27:17.620
我记得很清晰就象是昨天发生的一样
I remember it like it was yesterday.

27:17.630 --> 27:19.720
他就这么走进厨房
He just walked into the kitchen

27:19.730 --> 27:22.520
在结婚12年之后
after 12 years of marriage

27:22.530 --> 27:27.250
他要我立刻离开那幢房子
and says that he wanted me out of the house immediately.

27:27.260 --> 27:30.290
我永远忘不了那一天
I'll never forget the date.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.290
那是6月15号
It was June 15.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.890
(沙尔斯六月中旬起失踪)

27:35.900 --> 27:36.650
我想我已经了解够了
I think I have everything I need.

27:36.660 --> 27:39.820
但你都没问他的社会背景和教育状况
But you didn't even ask about social history or education.

27:39.830 --> 27:41.420
这些可都是标准程序
That's standard in these checks.

27:41.430 --> 27:42.790
那些都已经搞定了
That's been handled.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.790
我得尽快把这些报告发给
I have to get these reports filed with,

27:44.800 --> 27:47.150
战略行动组
uh,Strategic Operations ASAP.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.690
你是战略行动组的?
You're with Strategic Operations?

27:48.700 --> 27:50.350
他们负责处理这些调查
They handle these checks.

27:50.360 --> 27:54.050
9.11事件重组之后就不是了  梅瑞克先生
Not since the 9/11 realignment,Mr. Merrick.

27:54.060 --> 27:57.150
现在应该是首要情报部门负责这个
The Chief Information Officer does them now.

27:57.160 --> 28:01.350
他们处理了亚力克斯上次的调查
They handled Alex's last check.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.850
当一个探员升到你前夫那么高的位置的时候
When an agent reaches a level as high as your ex-husband's,

28:04.860 --> 28:08.850
战略行动组又会接手的
S.O. takes over. Again.

28:08.860 --> 28:10.690
官僚主义那一套
Bureaucracies.

28:10.700 --> 28:14.360
谢谢您的咖啡
Thank you for the coffee.

28:17.600 --> 28:23.730
听着  把她带出来就行了!
Look,just get her out of there.

28:23.900 --> 28:27.360
他们来了
They're here.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.350
-不要!  我们要走了! -别担心
No! See,we got to go! No,don't worry about it.

28:35.360 --> 28:39.160
把车发动起来!  去吧!
Just get the car started,all right? Go!

28:48.730 --> 28:49.490
爸爸!
Daddy!

28:49.500 --> 28:50.350
宝贝儿!
Hey,baby!

28:50.360 --> 28:51.290
准备出发了吗?
You ready to go?

28:51.300 --> 28:52.590
我们去哪儿呢?
Where are we going?

28:52.600 --> 28:54.450
迪斯尼乐园
Disneyland.

28:54.460 --> 28:55.230
你不能带走她  富兰克林先生!
You can't take her.Mr. Franklin,please.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
FBI
FBI

29:04.030 --> 29:05.990
来吧  我们走!
Come on,let's go!

29:06.000 --> 29:07.050
快宝贝儿  快走!
Go,baby. Go,baby.

29:07.060 --> 29:09.220
快  快!
Go,go,go,go,go,go!

29:09.730 --> 29:11.720
富兰克林把孩子带走了!
Franklin has the child!

29:12.030 --> 29:13.160
重复一遍  富兰克林把孩子带走了!
Repeat,Franklin has the child!

29:21.230 --> 29:23.920
晚上好  赫兰德太太
Evening,Mrs. Hollander.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.280
今晚你看上去真迷人
Don't you look lovely this evening.

29:25.290 --> 29:27.850
你应该告诉我你是个什么样的人
You should have told me what you were!

29:27.860 --> 29:29.220
上帝啊  我居然让你亲近了
My God,I let you near

29:29.230 --> 29:30.720
我的孩子们!
my children!

29:30.730 --> 29:35.460
别以为我会忘记你家门庭什么样子
Don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.790
过来  离马路远点
Come on,get away from the road.

30:32.800 --> 30:37.000
你想被抓住吗?
You want to get caught?

30:37.230 --> 30:39.150
我...
I,uh...

30:39.160 --> 30:41.220
我看到你在观察那些女孩儿
I saw you checking out those girls

30:41.230 --> 30:42.750
就在那餐馆那地方
back at the diner.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.150
啥?
What?

30:44.160 --> 30:45.650
得了吧  别装了
Come on. Fess up.

30:45.660 --> 30:48.950
不是  我只是看看她们是不是注意到我们了
No. I was just making sure that they weren't staring at us.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.090
用什么注意?  她们的美臀？
With what? Their asses?

30:51.100 --> 30:53.320
巴拿马的美女
Beautiful girls in Panama.

30:53.330 --> 30:55.190
她们都喜欢美国人
They love Americans.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.490
酷
Cool.

30:57.500 --> 31:01.690
你什么时候开始关注女生了?
So,uh,how long have you known about girls?

31:01.700 --> 31:04.950
有段时间了
Long enough.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.890
什么时候开始的?
Since when?

31:06.900 --> 31:08.590
13岁
Thirteen.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.250
13岁?
Thirteen?

31:10.260 --> 31:12.420
和谁?
With who?

31:12.430 --> 31:14.920
唐娜  安塞姆
Donna Anselmi.

31:14.930 --> 31:16.390
就是隔壁那小姑娘?
She was the kid next door.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.920
她好象是...
She was about...

31:17.930 --> 31:19.590
她比我大四岁
She's four years older than me.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.550
你妈妈还花钱让她教你法语
Your mom was paying her for French lessons.

31:21.560 --> 31:25.300
那是  她是挣到钱了
Well,she earned the money.

31:26.230 --> 31:27.720
过来点
Come on.

31:27.730 --> 31:29.220
离路远点
Away from the road.

31:29.230 --> 31:34.130
你还是离太近了  走吧
You're still way too close. Let's go.

31:34.630 --> 31:36.550
你想学点小窍门儿吗?  格雷丝?
You want to learn some tricks,Gracey?

31:36.560 --> 31:37.920
什么窍门儿?
Like what?

31:37.930 --> 31:41.500
好
Yeah.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.390
我让你进入我的生活
I let you into my life.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.050
对
Yeah.

31:48.060 --> 31:51.730
27!
Twenty seven!

31:56.930 --> 32:00.660
晚上好  赫兰德太太
Evening,Mrs. Hollander.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.000
感觉如何啊  小畜生?
How are you feeling,little Teddy?

33:20.800 --> 33:24.360
明天
Tomorrow.

33:33.430 --> 33:35.490
帕姆  我现在真没空和你谈
Pam,I really can't talk right now.

33:35.500 --> 33:39.430
那我该过会儿再打来
Maybe I should call back.

33:40.530 --> 33:43.390
你是谁?
Who is this?

33:43.400 --> 33:46.900
我想你已经知道了
I think you already know.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.390
如果你敢动帕姆
If you've done anything to Pam...

33:59.400 --> 34:00.750
或者我儿子一根毫毛...
or my boy...

34:00.760 --> 34:02.650
你我都知道你的家人没事
We both know your family's fine.

34:02.660 --> 34:05.850
尽管帕姆对你抛妻弃子感到心烦
Although,Pam did seem a little upset about you leaving.

34:05.860 --> 34:09.750
但是你确实逼于无奈  是不是?
But then you had to,didn't you?

34:09.760 --> 34:12.720
因为你不能让她找到
'Cause you couldn't let her find out.

34:12.730 --> 34:15.350
找到什么?
Find out about what?

34:15.360 --> 34:18.720
奥斯卡  沙尔斯还记得吗?
Oscar Shales. You remember?

34:18.730 --> 34:21.720
那个跑掉的家伙
The one that got away.

34:21.730 --> 34:23.690
除非他没走多远
Except he didn't get too far.

34:23.700 --> 34:25.720
是不是?
Did he?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.820
呃... 你渐渐不行了  斯科菲尔德
Uh... you're slipping,Scofield.

34:27.830 --> 34:28.850
也许
Maybe.

34:28.860 --> 34:31.590
我来假设一种情况
Let's hypothesize for a moment.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.650
假设我就是那个抓住沙尔斯的人
Let's pretend I was the one who caught Shales.

34:34.660 --> 34:38.350
我觉得我不会只是把这个疯子
I don't think I could of just handed that psychopath

34:38.360 --> 34:39.750
送上法庭那么简单
over to the courts,

34:39.760 --> 34:42.190
因为他让我追了那么久
not after he'd eluded me for so long.

34:42.200 --> 34:44.790
让我窘态尽出
Made me look bad.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.890
你假想过头了 小子
You've been out in the sun way too long,kid.

34:47.900 --> 34:49.620
你们FBI的人过着美好的生活
You feds make a nice living,

34:49.630 --> 34:52.550
但是不会有钱到去翻掉昂贵的草皮
but not so nice you go around tearing up expensive sod.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.890
除非你要挖个洞
Not unless you had to do a little digging,

34:54.900 --> 34:56.690
除非你要藏什么东西
not unless you wanted to hide something...

34:56.700 --> 35:00.560
或是藏什么人
or someone.

35:00.830 --> 35:02.950
这就是那些碱液的作用
That's what all the lye was for.

35:02.960 --> 35:05.150
不是吗?
Wasn't it?

35:05.160 --> 35:08.520
有两种碱液
See,because there are two kinds of lye.

35:08.530 --> 35:10.020
少量的是第一种
Small amounts,the first kind

35:10.030 --> 35:11.490
给园丁用的
can be a garderner's best friend.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.550
还有另外一种大剂量的 用来让尸体腐烂分解
And large bags,the other kind decomposes bodies.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.820
你该去写推理小说了
Ah,you should write mystery novels.

35:16.830 --> 35:18.690
我目前虽然不了解你
Now,I don't know about you,

35:18.700 --> 35:22.520
但要是我把某人埋在自家后院
but if I buried someone in my own backyard,

35:22.530 --> 35:27.960
我一定会整天都想着它
I'd think about it all the time.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.920
我会想...
I'd think...

35:29.930 --> 35:34.560
我会想或许我该把尸体换个地方
I'd think maybe I should move that body.

35:34.700 --> 35:38.690
但我记起来DNA渗入到泥土里
But then I remember,DNA leeches into soil.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.690
所以即使尸体不在了
So even when the body was gone,

35:40.700 --> 35:43.520
证据仍旧在那里
the proof of what I'd done would still be there.

35:43.530 --> 35:48.760
我能想像这是种什么感觉
I can imagine how it feels.

35:49.430 --> 35:51.290
这压力...
The pressure...

35:51.300 --> 35:54.720
这持续的恐惧
the constant fear.

35:54.730 --> 36:00.400
这不是人能够承受的
It's more than a man can bear.

36:02.230 --> 36:04.590
我现在想给你个机会
I'm going to give you a chance.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.120
放手不要管
Back off.

36:07.130 --> 36:09.620
让我和家人消失
Let me and my family disappear.

36:09.630 --> 36:14.650
作为回报  我会保守你的小秘密
And in return,I'll keep your little secret.

36:14.660 --> 36:18.190
这主意如何?
How does that sound?

36:18.200 --> 36:22.150
就像临终遗言
Like a dead man talking.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.350
我知道这不是你要的结果
I know it's not how you wanted this to play out.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.550
但是有时事情的发展
But sometimes things happen that are just

36:28.560 --> 36:33.220
你也控制不了
out of your control.

36:33.230 --> 36:36.220
现在就是这种情形
This is one of those times.

36:36.230 --> 36:40.020
小心你自己

36:40.030 --> 36:45.800

37:10.000 --> 37:12.590

37:12.600 --> 37:15.090
梦见12岁的小朋友在跳舞了?
Visions of 12 year olds dancing in your head?

37:15.100 --> 37:17.850
你们这是非法闯入民宅
You're trespassin'.

37:17.860 --> 37:20.350
没人住在这里了  黄毛
Nobody lives here anymore,Goldilocks.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.820
看起来主人家听说某人要重返社会
Seems the owner hit the bricks as soon as she heard

37:22.830 --> 37:26.220
就离开了
a certain someone had reentered society.

37:26.230 --> 37:30.520
走得很匆忙  还落下点东西
Left in a hurry,too,even left some stuff behind.

37:30.530 --> 37:33.650
所以这里就是帝博格实践
So this is where Theodore practiced

37:33.660 --> 37:37.700
"性变态大全"的地方
Pervert Knows Best.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.990
这里

37:49.030 --> 37:51.490

37:51.500 --> 37:52.950
你是不是让她穿着登顿医生的衣服
did you make her wear Dr. Denton's

37:52.960 --> 37:57.190
还打扮成男妓才让你有感觉的?
and hold a lunch box to help you get all worked up?

37:57.200 --> 38:01.290
布拉德利  我根本不期盼一个

38:01.300 --> 38:03.050

会明白
to understand

38:04.730 --> 38:08.460

38:16.260 --> 38:18.520
你想知道我们怎么找到你的?

38:25.530 --> 38:28.990
原谅你这小白脸
to take your white-trash ass back.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.320
每封信最终都被
And every one of them

38:31.330 --> 38:36.590
退回到福克斯河监狱
boomeranged to Fox River marked "return to sender."

38:36.600 --> 38:37.890
警卫们
Oh,the guards

38:37.900 --> 38:39.890
看了以后笑死了  是吧盖瑞?
had a real laugh readin' 'em,didn't we,Geary?

38:39.900 --> 38:41.450
我们笑翻了

38:41.460 --> 38:44.750
这可真污秽
That is one mangy

38:44.760 --> 38:47.090

38:50.330 --> 38:51.850

否则我就像拔鸡毛一样

38:57.430 --> 39:01.000
一针一针地拆掉
stitch by stitch.

39:07.630 --> 39:11.450
好吧  你想知道钱在哪儿?
Fine,you want to know where the money is?

39:11.460 --> 39:16.460
