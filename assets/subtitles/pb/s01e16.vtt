09:34.170 --> 09:35.400

你有没想过他们会怎么处置你?

不是我干的 兄弟 这只是个圈套 不是我干的

-你曾在他公司工作  -那又怎么样?
  -You worked for his company.  -So what?

09:53.060 --> 09:54.740
几星期前你在那儿被解雇了
From which you were fired a few weeks ago.

09:54.770 --> 09:56.920
我在货物仓装卸货物的 从没见过这个家伙
I loaded containers in the warehouse.Never met the guy.

09:56.950 --> 09:59.860
该死的 迈克尔? 你他妈的好像是个侦探似的
 What the hell, Mike?You sound like one of the damn detectives.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.850
-我只是在说  -你认为是我干的?
  -I'm just saying.  -You think I did it?

10:07.650 --> 10:10.370
我听说你欠谁9万块钱
I heard you owe someone 90 grand.

10:13.270 --> 10:15.260
-谁告诉你的?  -大家都在说
  -Who told you that?  -People talk.

10:16.430 --> 10:18.670
我知道斯蒂德曼很有钱
And I know Steadman had a lot of money.

10:18.770 --> 10:21.180
也许我为人确实不怎么样 但我绝不是杀人犯
I may be a lot of things,but I'm not a murderer.

10:21.210 --> 10:23.930
那昨晚你在那个车库干什么?
Then what were you doing in that garage last night?

10:25.890 --> 10:29.610
你向警察坦白了你去过那儿
You admitted to the police you were there.

10:32.140 --> 10:37.150
老实说 林肯 我不知道你怎么会走这一步的
Honestly, Linc,I don't know how it's come to this.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.570
你不能老抱怨妈妈死的早
And you can't keep blaming Mom for dying

10:39.710 --> 10:42.960
爸爸离家的早 因为我也都经历了这些
and Dad for leaving,because I was there, too.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.650
区别是 我坚持下来了
Difference is, I got out.

10:46.170 --> 10:50.840
我用妈妈的一半寿险金完成了学业
Mom had life insurance.I took my half, put myself through school.

10:52.370 --> 10:55.560
而你那一半花哪去了 林肯?
What did you do with your half, Linc?

10:58.070 --> 11:00.260
事情并非都像表面看到的那样 迈克尔
Everything's not how it looks, Michael.

11:01.610 --> 11:03.990
希望那是真的
I hope for your sake that's true.

11:04.740 --> 11:08.040
这儿  这儿要表现出愤怒
Here...Here is where we want the turn to anger.

11:08.170 --> 11:10.310
相信我 这没问题
Trust me, that won't be a problem.

11:10.780 --> 11:13.920
记住强调他的犯罪记录 他是个惯犯
Now remember to stress his record as a repeat offender.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.750
要判他死刑 我们需要得到公众的支持
We need the public behind us if we want the death penalty.

11:20.940 --> 11:24.650
那我们拿那个唐克雷蒂洲长怎么办?他是个想升官的家伙 他不成问题
And where are we with Governor Tancredi?He has aspirations. He won't be a problem.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.050
还有30秒 副总统夫人
 Thirty seconds，Madam Vice President.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.840
报纸上全是要处死他的谴责声
The papers have already crucified him.

11:32.070 --> 11:34.080
警察说案件发生后他们就接到了一个电话
The police say they got a phone call right after the murder

11:34.110 --> 11:37.030
是一个声称看到林肯从车库跑出来的家伙打的
from someone claiming they saw Lincoln running from the parking garage.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.600
当时他欠债9万块钱
He was into someone for 90 grand.

11:38.630 --> 11:41.680
他要那么多钱干什么? 毒品? 贿赂?
What do you need that kind of money for?Drugs, bribes?

11:42.150 --> 11:43.920
不要老把他想的那么好
Forget about what you want to be true.

11:43.950 --> 11:45.320
看事情要客观点
Let's look at this objectively.

11:45.350 --> 11:47.110
-你也应该客观点  -我就这么做的
  -Maybe you should too.  -I am.

11:47.590 --> 11:49.870
行了 知道吗 我保证我什么都不说
All right, you know what?I promised I wouldn't say anything,

11:49.900 --> 11:51.530
但我已经厌烦了你老这么说他
but I'm getting tired of you talking about him

11:51.560 --> 11:54.670
好像他只是你以前的邻居似的
like he's some guy from the neighborhood that you used to know.

11:54.700 --> 11:55.600
他是你哥哥
He's your brother.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.840
我知道 我知道那会儿他还帮过你和你爸爸
I know.And I know he helped you out with your dad back in the day,

11:57.870 --> 11:59.890
但你应该看看他现在的样子
but you should see the kind of person he is now,

11:59.920 --> 12:01.870
以及他交往的朋友
the kind of people he keeps friends with.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.720
你想知道那9万块是用来干什么的吗?
You want to know what the 90 grand was for?

12:03.750 --> 12:05.650
-我当然想知道  -你
  -I think I do.  -You.

12:06.370 --> 12:07.250
什么意思?
What do you mean?

12:07.390 --> 12:10.790
你18岁时从妈妈的保险金里得到的
The money you got when you were 18 years old from your mother's life insurance

12:10.820 --> 12:12.110
帮你拿到学位
The money that paid for your degree,

12:12.140 --> 12:14.480
帮你找到工作 买了大公寓的钱
that got you this job,that bought you your loft?

12:14.510 --> 12:17.860
你妈妈没有人生保险的 那些钱都是林肯弄来的
Your mother never had life insurance.That money came from Lincoln.

12:19.620 --> 12:21.760
-怎么弄的?  -他借来的
  -How?  -He borrowed it.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.000
他知道钱很难还清
He knew it would be tough to pay back,

12:23.030 --> 12:25.810
但没关系 因为他一直坚信这些是你应该得到的
but that didn't matter,because he thought you deserved it.

12:25.840 --> 12:29.090
他也知道 如果让你知道这钱的来源 你是不会要的
He also knew you'd never accept it if you knew it came from him.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.650
迈克尔
Michael,

12:31.730 --> 12:34.970
因为你哥哥 你才会有现在
you are where you are because of your brother.

12:35.090 --> 12:37.900
你是说是我迫使我哥哥变成这样的?
You're telling me he is where he is because of me?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.430
为什么?
Why?

12:49.500 --> 12:52.120
你为什么不告诉我钱的事?
Why didn't you tell me about the money?

12:52.400 --> 12:55.740
-没必要  -林肯
  -No need to.  -Oh, Linc.

12:55.830 --> 12:57.800
谁告诉你的? 维罗妮卡?
Who told you? Veronica?

12:58.830 --> 13:02.290
她对这件事怎么看的? 关于我杀人的事?
What did she make of all this? About me?

13:02.540 --> 13:03.920
我不知道
I don't know.

13:04.020 --> 13:06.540
幸好她及时抽身了 啊?
Glad she got out when she did, huh?

13:06.640 --> 13:08.780
你知道她对你的感觉
You know how she feels about you.

13:09.290 --> 13:12.580
在我们小时候就已经存在的了
It's been the same way ever since we were kids.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.410
是的
Yeah.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.550
林肯
Linc,

13:20.220 --> 13:22.890
-我得向你道歉  -干什么?
  -I owe you an apology.  -For what?

13:24.590 --> 13:26.580
你打电话来的那晚
The night you called.

13:27.550 --> 13:30.460
如果我接了电话 说不定我就能阻止这一切
If we'd talked,maybe I could have stopped you.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.270
嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿 这不是你的错
Hey, hey, hey, hey.This ain't your fault.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.150

28:13.590 --> 28:15.300
也许那不是个恰当的词
That actually might be the wrong word.

28:15.330 --> 28:18.970
老实说 曾吸毒的时候感觉也很开心
I'll be honest,there were times I was using,I felt pretty damn happy.

28:19.150 --> 28:24.540

理论上说 我现在还是 怎么了?
I still am, in theory. Why?

29:02.090 --> 29:03.750

29:03.850 --> 29:06.300

Maybe we could talk about it over dinner.

I got a gift card to the Red Lobster over off the interstate.

34:48.090 --> 34:49.740
调度命令刚刚下来
Deployment orders just came down.

34:49.890 --> 34:51.940

能帮帮忙吗 我那边出了点问题?
Can you give me a hand with something out back?

35:15.970 --> 35:18.360
那是我妹妹!而你在对她撒谎
That's my sister you lied to in there.

35:19.580 --> 35:23.380
这就是我让你照顾她们的原因
Which is why I know you're going to take care of them when I'm gone.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.200
太疯狂了
This is crazy.

35:25.720 --> 35:26.970
也许吧
Maybe.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.240
我被踢出军队也是这样的疯狂
 But so is the way I got kicked out of the Army.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.360
我开卡车被抓也是这样的感觉
So is the way I got busted for driving that truck.

35:33.200 --> 35:36.330
就象我对里面那个女人的感觉一样
And so is the way I feel about that woman up in there.

35:36.870 --> 35:38.930
她嫁给了一个军人
She married a military man

35:39.980 --> 35:42.440
一个知道怎么处理自己事情的人
who knows how to take care of his business.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.750
而如今 如果我让他觉得我是个暴徒
Now if I look like one of these thugs, now,

35:45.780 --> 35:48.680
你知道她会干出什么事来吗 啊?
what do think she's going to do? Huh?

35:48.760 --> 35:51.920
我进去后 她能等我多久?
How long do you think she's going to wait for me while I'm inside?

35:52.660 --> 35:54.250
我不知道 老兄
I don't know, man.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.730
你欠我的 兄弟
You owe me this, man.

35:58.840 --> 36:04.240
千万别让她知道我在哪 听到了吗?
Don't you ever let her know where I am.Do you feel me?

36:42.060 --> 36:44.890
通常 我是不会这么做的
Usually, I do this the other way.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.150
-你为什么想要  -我想要怎样就怎样
  -Why do you want to...  -I want what I want.

36:54.550 --> 36:57.300
你要是把这个给别人看
You show this to anyone else,

36:57.400 --> 36:59.880
我就把整件事取消
I am calling the whole thing off.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.050
我的治疗师说
My therapist said...

38:24.080 --> 38:26.490
她说我心里憋的东西太多
She said that I'm holding too much in

38:27.490 --> 38:29.630
她说我得当面找你
and that I need to confront you

38:30.100 --> 38:32.670
告诉你 我被伤害得很深
to let you know how betrayed I feel.

38:34.220 --> 38:38.220
我让你进入我的生活 我的家
I let you into my life,my home,

38:38.310 --> 38:40.740
上帝 我甚至让你靠近我的孩子!
my God, I let you near my children!

38:40.840 --> 38:42.250
我从没碰过他们
I never touched them.

38:42.330 --> 38:44.730
你本应该告诉我你是怎样一个人
You should have told me what you were.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.340
你觉得只有你一个感觉被背叛了吗?
You think that you're the only one who feels betrayed?

38:51.740 --> 38:58.020
我 爱你的 苏珊
I loved you, Susan.

39:00.180 --> 39:04.460
真正的爱 这是我生命中第一次
Real love.For the first time in my life.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.480
然后你却把我
And then to have you do me like that,

39:13.650 --> 39:17.250
像东西一样把我喂狗 把我扔出窗外
to just throw me out to the dogs,just toss me out the back door...

39:17.340 --> 39:19.440
-你是个杀人凶手 泰德!  -够了 
  -You're a murderer, Teddy!  -That's enough!

39:22.920 --> 39:27.810
我过去确实干过坏事  但当我遇见你后  那个
I have sinned in the past,but when I met you,that person,

39:28.250 --> 39:31.820
那个曾经干过很多坏事的家伙  死了
the one that did all those terrible things, he died.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.850
我重生了
And I was reborn.

39:35.060 --> 39:37.880
你的爱让我 变成一个
By the grace of your love, I was a...

39:38.400 --> 39:41.560
一个崭新的  好人
A new man. A better man.

39:42.490 --> 39:50.170
不 这并不能抹去你曾在阿拉巴马 杀死6个学生的事实
No.That doesn't just erase the man who killed six students in Alabama.

39:53.190 --> 39:56.510
我想你是对的
I guess that's where you're right.

39:59.640 --> 40:04.100
当你把我送进这个地方 让我和那些人在一起的时候
Because when you sent me here to this place, with these people,

40:05.390 --> 40:09.130
那个邪恶的我又复活了
it brought that old dirty bastard right back home.

40:09.320 --> 40:14.520
其实 窗口有盏蜡烛
In fact, there was a candle in the window

40:16.190 --> 40:19.510
等着我走过你家门口那些台阶
just waiting for me to walk up them front steps.

40:31.520 --> 40:33.490
你知道 我会
You know, I'm gonna...

40:34.530 --> 40:37.080
我总有一天会释放出去的
I'm gonna get out of here someday.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.960
而那天到来的时候
And when I do,

40:45.260 --> 40:50.870
别以为我会不记得你家门前是什么样子 苏珊 
don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like, Susan.

41:20.590 --> 41:22.420
快结束了
It's almost over.

41:23.470 --> 41:27.720
布伦斯很快就死了 然后一切又会变得和以前一样
Burrows will be dead soon and then things will start getting back to normal.

41:34.820 --> 41:38.380
我知道你遭受了很多
I know that you've been through a lot,

41:38.970 --> 41:42.710
我保证 最糟糕的已经过去
but I promise you the worst is now behind us.

41:56.730 --> 41:58.520
亲爱的姐姐
My dear sister

42:00.600 --> 42:03.600
你绝对感受不到我的经历
you have no idea what I've been through.

42:05.130 --> 42:07.340
晚安 特伦斯
Good night, Terrence.
