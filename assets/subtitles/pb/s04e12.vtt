《越狱》  前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.300
从现在开始  我要求每个人
From now on, I'm asking

00:04.300 --> 00:06.330
任何时候  都把卡放在
that everyone keep their card on them.

00:06.330 --> 00:08.070
自己的身上
At all times.

00:08.070 --> 00:09.570
格雷琴没拿到第六张卡
Gretchen didn't get us the sixth card.

00:09.570 --> 00:10.570
那我们怎么办
So where does that leave us?

00:10.570 --> 00:13.470
但格雷琴给了你一份资料
You know, Gretchen did pass on this one piece of information for you.

00:13.470 --> 00:15.100
应该对你有帮助
It's gonna be helpful.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.170
我接到一位老友的电话  听说"锡拉"有眉目
I got a call from an old friend, heard Scylla was

00:20.170 --> 00:21.370
他想知道
in play and he wants to know

00:21.370 --> 00:22.870
他能否弄到手  我找了个安全的地方
if he can get in on it. I've set up a safe house

00:22.870 --> 00:24.330
在那可以跟他谈
where you can hear him out.

00:24.330 --> 00:25.700
-你有笔吗  -等一下
Do you have a pen? Just a minute.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.630
皮尔蒙特街1917号
1917 Piermt.

00:29.470 --> 00:31.600
赛尔夫探员
Agent Self...

00:31.600 --> 00:34.970
我们已恭候多时
we've been waiting.

00:34.970 --> 00:36.100
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯从那扇门
When Scofield and Burrows walk

00:36.100 --> 00:37.600
走出来  给他们一次
rough the door, give them

00:37.600 --> 00:38.730
投降的机会
an opportunity to surrender.

00:38.730 --> 00:41.600
他们不可能乖乖地束手就擒的
There's no way they're gonna hand it over without a fight.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.800
如果他们动手  我们以牙还牙
If they take that position, we'll respond in kind.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.470
我们走错一步
We make one wrong move,

00:47.470 --> 00:49.660
监视器就会启动
the camera goes on,

00:49.660 --> 00:51.270
克兰兹将军就会发现我们
And General  Krantz will know we're inside.

00:58.670 --> 01:01.600
马上派一队人下去
I need a team downstairs now!

01:24.630 --> 01:27.570
应该不会等很久
Shouldn't be long.

01:27.570 --> 01:31.000
你确定我们不用下去等
You sure we shouldn't be waiting down there

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
迈克尔带着"锡拉"出来吗
for Michael to leave with Scylla.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
如果你懂战术的话
If you knew anything about tactics,

01:35.000 --> 01:36.670
这里就是所谓的制高点
you would know this is the high ground.

01:36.670 --> 01:39.030
况且我们有消声器
Besides we have silencers.

01:50.270 --> 01:52.530
"锡拉"不是一张卡
So, Scylla isn't one card.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.830
而是六张
It's six.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.230
确定他没带炸药后
Make sure he's not armed with explosives.

02:03.230 --> 02:05.000
就杀了他
Then kill him.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.370
把枪放下
Drop 'em.

02:20.370 --> 02:22.570
不然  我就打爆他的头
Or I blow his head clean off.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.100
你该把枪放下
You're gonna want to put that down.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.570
你放不放
You're gonna want to put that down.

02:33.730 --> 02:36.430
把枪放下
Lower your weapons.

02:37.470 --> 02:39.530
快点  过去
Come on. Get over there.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.100
快点  老头
Come on,old man.

02:46.470 --> 02:49.870
由世上最聪明的人设计出的安全系统
The best minds in the world designed this security system,

02:49.870 --> 02:52.900
你几乎把它打破了
and you almost beat it.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.700
不用太伤心嘛
The frustration must be killing you.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.470
你输定了
You blew it.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.970
其实
Actually...

03:00.970 --> 03:04.000
万事俱备  只欠东风
there's only one missing piece of the puzzle.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.170
你正好把它带来了
And you just brought it to me.

03:06.170 --> 03:10.000
我不知道你说的是什么
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
你的"锡拉"卡
Your Scylla card.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.670
给我
Now.

04:05.570 --> 04:08.100

Not what you expected?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.470

You're a coward!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.700

05:01.700 --> 05:03.530
你以为格雷琴和巴格维尔会给你"锡拉"
You think Gretchen and Bagwell are gonna get you Scylla,

05:03.530 --> 05:05.630
但他们的对手

看来你不喜欢久居一处  是吧
I guess you don't like to stay put much, do you?

06:37.530 --> 06:40.330
天啊  我天生就是个好动之人

The cards were keys...

08:13.370 --> 08:16.330

08:16.400 --> 08:19.270
这个才是锡拉
this is Scylla.

08:20.770 --> 08:21.970
你现在应该
Guess right now you wish

08:22.030 --> 08:23.670
后悔陷害我们了吧  将军
you'd framed somebody else, huh, General?

08:23.730 --> 08:27.600
你们是出不去的
You're not even close to getting out of here.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.070
我们走
Let's go.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.030
哥们  你确定吗
You sure, Papi?

08:39.100 --> 08:40.870
我们不知道原路返回会怎样
We have no idea what's waiting for us back there.

对  但我们也不知道往上走会怎样
Yeah, but we don't know what's be up there

08:42.300 --> 08:43.670

08:43.730 --> 08:45.730
将军  我们需要你

09:02.270 --> 09:04.200

09:34.670 --> 09:36.600
红色警报
We have a major situation.

09:44.330 --> 09:47.270
迈克尔  谢天谢地

09:47.330 --> 09:49.330
我们搞定了
We got it.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.370
你那边怎么样
How's it going on your end?

09:52.430 --> 09:54.100
非常好

09:54.170 --> 09:56.300
再给我五分钟
But give me five more minutes.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.500
你告诉怀特杀我儿子时
Is that the desk

10:31.570 --> 10:33.870
就坐在这里吗
you sat at when you told Wyatt to kill my son?

10:33.930 --> 10:35.770
放心吧  阿历克斯
Don't worry, Alex.

10:35.830 --> 10:39.400
过了今天  他就不会再发号施令了
He won't be giving any more orders after today.

10:40.670 --> 10:42.870
我很好奇
I'm curious.

10:42.930 --> 10:45.170
你们认为你们能出去吗
How do you think you're getting out of here?

10:45.230 --> 10:47.030
我们
The second

10:47.100 --> 10:48.900
走出电梯时
we stepped off the elevator,

10:48.970 --> 10:51.770
我的警卫就下令封锁了整幢大楼
my guard made a call to put the entire building under lockdown.

10:51.830 --> 10:55.230
禁止一切出入
Nothing gets in or out.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.430
不管你们在等什么
So whatever you're waiting for

10:58.500 --> 11:01.370
都不会来了
it isn't coming.

12:09.570 --> 12:11.130
你在看什么
What are you looking at, huh?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.330
没有  什么都没有
Nothing. Nothing.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.530
你在看什么
Huh? What are you looking at?!

12:13.600 --> 12:14.700
什么都没有
Nothing.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.470
别老瞪着我  回去
Don't you be eyeballing me, soldier.Back to work.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.070
我们不可能搞定了
There's no way this is gonna end well.

12:26.070 --> 12:28.230
我们应该离开这里
We should get out of here.

12:28.300 --> 12:32.600
等20分钟赚1.25亿美金不值吗
Don't you think it's worth 20 minutes for $125 million?

12:32.670 --> 12:34.500
闭嘴吧
Suck it up!

12:37.030 --> 12:39.330
派一队人守在在将军办公室外
I want a team outside of the General's office.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.430
我们必须解决这事
We need to get a handle on this.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
检查电梯
Check the elevator.

12:44.870 --> 12:46.870
把守楼梯
Cover the stairwell.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.300
设计这么多就为了保密一些姓名和报告吗
All that design just to hold some names and reports.

12:54.370 --> 12:57.000
姓名和报告
Names and reports?

12:57.070 --> 13:01.730
这是政府还是你父亲告诉你们的
Is that informatn from the government,or your father?

13:03.700 --> 13:04.970
小心点
Careful.

13:05.030 --> 13:07.870
右边最上层抽屉
Top right-hand drawer.

13:07.930 --> 13:11.100
有你感兴趣的东西
It's something that should be of interest to you.

13:11.170 --> 13:14.530
出现你们的名字时  我调出来的
I pulled it when your names came up.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.730
你为什么离开
Why did you leave?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.000
我在一个跨国集团
I took a position

13:19.070 --> 13:20.830
找了一份工作
with a group of multinationals we call

13:20.900 --> 13:22.400
我们称之为"公司"
the Company.

13:22.470 --> 13:24.770
他们决定这个国家的一切
They call every shot this country takes.

13:24.830 --> 13:28.670
你们出生前  我就认识你们父亲
I knew your father since before you were born

13:28.730 --> 13:31.070
你们知道他曾为"公司"卖命
You do know he worked for the Company?

13:31.130 --> 13:34.170
对  他是个数据分析家
Yeah. He was data analyst.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.630
他是这样跟你说的吗
Is that what he told you?

13:36.700 --> 13:39.330
也有道理
Well, it makes sense.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.500
他想保护你们  远离真相
He wanteto protect you from the truth.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.170
我警告你
I'm warning you.

13:43.230 --> 13:45.400
你父亲是个聪明人
Your father was a brilliant man,

13:45.470 --> 13:48.170
但他绝不可能击垮"公司"
but he could never have defeated the Company.

13:48.230 --> 13:50.370
你们没必要像他一样
You don't have to make the same

13:50.430 --> 13:54.200
犯愚蠢的致命错误
misguided, fatal mistake that he did.

13:54.270 --> 13:56.930
你们对"公司"知之甚少
There's so much you don't know about the Company...

13:57.000 --> 13:58.930
还有锡拉
about Scylla...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.930
你父亲
about your dad...

14:01.000 --> 14:02.930
还有你母亲
about your mother.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.230
我发誓  我会杀了你
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.630
放松点
Let's get through this.

14:11.270 --> 14:13.130
计划是什么
What's the plan?

14:24.300 --> 14:26.430
赛尔夫探员
Agent Self?

14:26.500 --> 14:27.570
进行如何
Where are we?

14:27.630 --> 14:29.500
他们进去大约2个小时了

Not yet, but I promise you, Herb,

14:33.030 --> 14:34.970
我第一个告诉你  好吧
you'll be the first to know, okay?

14:35.030 --> 14:37.100
一旦得到消息  我会开一辆无牌车
And as soon as I get word, I'm taking an unmarked car

14:37.170 --> 14:39.030
去接头点  然后我再回来
to the pickup location, and then I'm gonna head back over...

14:39.100 --> 14:41.870
不  你直接去达洛斯议员办公室
No. You go directlyto Senator Dallow's office

14:41.930 --> 14:44.330
我会让检察长在那等着
I'll have the attorney general standing by.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.930
我们不能临时改变计划
We can't veer from the plan here.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.170
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

14:47.230 --> 14:48.300
明白
Yes, sir.

14:48.370 --> 14:50.300
就快结束了
We're almost at the finish line.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.370

15:03.130 --> 15:05.170
我们要做好准备
We need to be prepared to go in

15:05.230 --> 15:07.200
随时待命

15:30.430 --> 15:33.830
你们想要什么
What is it you all want?

15:35.330 --> 15:36.470
费尔南多

15:36.530 --> 15:37.830
只要开口

你以为只要
You think you can just

15:43.430 --> 15:45.270
向我们撒点钱
throw some cash at us, huh?

15:45.330 --> 15:47.530
我们就会忘掉一切吗
We'll forget everything, call it a day?

15:47.600 --> 15:50.200
潘姆需要你  阿历克斯
Pam needs you, Alex.

15:50.270 --> 15:52.500
此刻更是如此
Now more than ever.

15:52.570 --> 15:54.900
你们都很伤心
You're both still hurting,

15:54.970 --> 15:57.030
但时间是良药
but given time, it'll pass.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.700
也许过段日子你们又可以
And maybe some day you'll be ready

15:58.770 --> 16:01.530
为人父母  钱不在话下
to be parents again, and if money is no object.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.000
你应该听听自己
You should hear yourself right now.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.270
现在声音多绝望
The desperation in your voice.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.430
你听到了吗
You hear it?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.130
好好考虑我说的话
But listen to what it is I'm saying.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.530
离我远点
Get away from me.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.700
你想要的一切

16:11.770 --> 16:13.130
离我远点
Get away from me.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.870

目睹公司化为灰烬
is to see The Company burn to the ground,

16:29.830 --> 16:31.930
而你  锒铛入狱

16:33.430 --> 16:35.730
这就是我们想要的
It's what we all want.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.130
这是不可能的
That'll never happen.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.630

17:02.870 --> 17:04.930
不要担心
Don't worry about it.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.530
你没事吧
Are you okay?

17:34.070 --> 17:36.470
很快一切都会结束
This is going to end

17:36.530 --> 17:40.030
结局不会乐观
very soon, and it's not going to be pretty.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.800
最后一次机会

17:42.870 --> 17:46.130
把"锡拉"留下

17:46.230 --> 17:47.900
你们都自由了

17:49.700 --> 17:51.870
只管从这扇门出去
Just walk out the door.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.670
你要去哪
Where are you going?

17:58.730 --> 18:01.900
你杀了我  然后呢
You shoot me, and then what?

18:01.970 --> 18:05.370
从19层高的办公室窗户跳下去吗
You jump out the window of my 19th floor office?

迈克尔  你杀了我就没了筹码
Michael, you kill me, you lose your levera.

18:13.030 --> 18:15.000

She says if you don't

18:39.330 --> 18:42.400

爸爸

18:49.900 --> 18:52.030
求你
Please.

18:55.030 --> 18:57.570
按他们说的做
Do what they want.

19:01.470 --> 19:04.230
将军  我建议你采纳你女儿的建议
I suggest you take your daughter's advice, General.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.230
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

19:12.820 --> 19:14.750
丽莎  你在哪

19:14.820 --> 19:16.180
让她听电话

我们离开后你可以跟你女儿通话
You can talk to your daughter after we've left

19:18.550 --> 19:20.050
当然  是带着"锡拉"一起离开
with Scylla, of course.

19:22.150 --> 19:24.780
据说你女朋友
Look, I read enough intel on your girlfriend

19:24.850 --> 19:26.920
连只苍蝇也不会杀
to know that she wouldn't hurt a fly.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.150
3个月前还有可能
Maybe three months ago.

19:29.150 --> 19:32.720
但现在她变了

19:32.780 --> 19:35.050
我们都变了

这是你杀的所有人的名单
This is a list of everyone you've killed.

19:38.350 --> 19:42.520
父辈  子女  朋友
Fathers, sons, friends.

19:45.380 --> 19:46.780
你真的认为
Do you really think

19:46.850 --> 19:48.880
你女儿的性命比他们的值钱吗
your daughter's life is worth any more than theirs?

19:48.950 --> 19:51.720
现在只有两个选择
One of two things is going to happen now.

19:51.780 --> 19:54.580
放我们走  或者牺牲丽莎
You're going to let us go, or Lisa will die.

19:54.650 --> 19:56.880
任选其一
Either one is fine with me.

19:56.950 --> 20:00.350
不要伤害她
Just don't hurt her.

20:00.420 --> 20:04.580
只要你信守诺言  我们就不伤人
As long as you hold up your end of the deal, we won't.

20:07.950 --> 20:10.520
你下过令要转移"锡拉"
You ordered Scylla to be moved.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.750
让我们体验一下吧
Show us how.

20:22.350 --> 20:24.350
我跟他们出去

他们肯定找到另外的出路
They must have found another way out.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.580
不可能  那他们就被抓住或者死了
That's impossible. Well, then, they're caught or dead.

20:49.650 --> 20:51.580
我们还要等多久
How much longer are we gonna wait?

20:51.650 --> 20:53.820
是你说斯科菲尔德已经计划好了
You were the one who said Scofield had a plan.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.620
是你用枪指着怀特先生
And you put a gun in Mr. White's face!

20:55.680 --> 20:57.620
他会报警的
He was going to call the police.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.280

你们一次两个人溜出去
I want you to slip out two at a time.

21:17.880 --> 21:18.920
你们两个先走
Okay, you two first.

21:18.980 --> 21:20.280
为什么不能一起走
Why can't we all go together?

21:20.350 --> 21:21.650
你在这儿  去抓他们
You're here. Go arrest them.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.450
我想在他们发现之前
I want to get out as many of you as possible

21:23.520 --> 21:24.580
尽可能多的救你们出去
before they realize what's happening.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.150

你得一辈子逃命
You're gonna run for your life,

所有人趴下  放下武器

22:30.150 --> 22:32.320
感觉如何
How does it feel, huh?

22:32.380 --> 22:34.580
被迫做不想做的事
Being forced to do something you don't want to do?

但如果你不照做

22:36.520 --> 22:38.320
你关心的人就会遭殃

22:38.380 --> 22:39.450

种什么因  得什么果  将军
What goes around, comes around, huh, General?

22:45.950 --> 22:48.220

我无法想象你想做的事
I can't imagine that you'd want to.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.850
不论他们对你做了什么
Whatever they've done to you...

22:55.920 --> 22:57.720
你就是他们  我的朋友
"They" are you, my friend.

22:59.150 --> 23:01.880

23:01.950 --> 23:03.750

You'll never see us coming.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.150
实际上  一旦我们把"锡拉"交给正确的人
Actually, once we get Scylla into the right hands,

26:16.220 --> 26:18.250
你所有的探员和行动
alyour agents, all your operations--

26:18.320 --> 26:20.450
都会公之于众
it'll all be out in the open,

26:20.520 --> 26:22.980
那时  人人都能看到你们
and then everyone... will see you coming.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.250
这是我们干的
We did this to you.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.720
我们干的
We did this to you.

26:32.780 --> 26:34.650
别忘了  老头
Don't you forget that, old man.

26:36.850 --> 26:40.520
想知道你父亲替公司干过什么吗
Want to know what your father really did for the Company?

26:40.580 --> 26:42.480
他是个刽子手
He was an executioner.

26:42.550 --> 26:45.950
他杀掉所有背叛公司的人
He killed people who defected from the company.

26:45.950 --> 26:50.950
而他训练的人会追杀你们
now the men he trained will be coming after you.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.750
跟我来  有点不对劲
Come on. Something's not right.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.920
德巴克女士
Mrs. Tabak?

27:30.120 --> 27:31.980
德巴克女士
Mrs. Tabak?!

27:49.880 --> 27:51.220
她刚走
She just left.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.480
唐克雷蒂  她肯定没走远
Tancredi.she has to be right outside.

28:32.450 --> 28:34.580
你还好吗
Are you all right?

28:34.650 --> 28:35.980
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

28:36.050 --> 28:38.020
我现在赶回来
I'm heading back now.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.520
不  我要你待在安全的地方
No. I want you in a secure location,

28:39.580 --> 28:40.880
有人监护你
under supervision.

28:40.950 --> 28:41.950
你先回家
You go home.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.280
但我必须过去
But I really need to be there.

28:43.350 --> 28:46.820
我们一拿回"锡拉"  就给你打电话
I'll call you once we get Scylla back

28:48.680 --> 28:50.380
我们把那辆卡车的牌照和识别码
We've given the truck's license plate and VIN number

28:50.450 --> 28:51.620
报给当地警局了
to the local police...

28:51.680 --> 28:54.950
一旦斯科菲尔德破解出标准操作程序
We lost our tactical initiative the minute

28:55.020 --> 28:56.880
我们就失去了战术主动权
that Scoeld figured out our SOPs.

28:56.950 --> 28:59.720
我们要打败他
If we want to defeat him,

29:00.680 --> 29:04.520
就必须打破陈规  出其不意
we've got to alter our way operating become unpredictable.

29:20.620 --> 29:23.120
是他们  迈克尔  你们在哪
It's them.Michael,where are you?

29:23.120 --> 29:24.920
在公司的装甲车上
The Company's armored truck.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.020
我们拿到了
We have it.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.180
他们拿到了
They got it.

29:28.250 --> 29:31.220
听着  迈克尔  保持警惕  好吧
Okay, listen. Michael, stay on alert, okay?

29:31.280 --> 29:32.620
我会的
I will.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.320
我们在约定地点见
See you at the rendezvous.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.320
你们去安全的地方
You guys get someplace safe.

30:26.380 --> 30:27.780
等我们的消息
Wait till you hear from us.

30:27.850 --> 30:29.680
-明白  -祝好运  伙计
You got it. Good luck, Bobby.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.350
他们在哪
Where are they?

30:35.350 --> 30:37.720
机场  我们看到他们了
The airport. We have visual confirmation.

30:37.780 --> 30:39.720
抓到他们之前
Make sure not a single plane leaves the ground

30:39.780 --> 30:41.450
别让任何一架飞机离开机场
before we've got them.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.480
明白  长官
Understood, sir.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.280
看紧斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
Stay with Scofield and Burrows.

30:45.350 --> 30:47.250
"锡拉"最重要
Scylla's the priority.

30:53.950 --> 30:55.680
女士们先生们  请注意
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,

30:55.750 --> 30:58.420
由于技术故障  所有航班
due to technical issues, all flights have been

30:58.480 --> 31:00.420
暂时无法起飞
temporarily grounded.

31:00.480 --> 31:01.820
看
Check it out.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.820
他们就在后面
They're right behind us.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.880
我们上
Let's go.

31:21.540 --> 31:22.330
现在
Now.

31:36.970 --> 31:38.560
现在
Now.

31:45.650 --> 31:47.080
我叫约翰·伯顿
Hey, my name's John Burton.

31:47.150 --> 31:49.150
我是非当班的芝加哥警察
I'm an off-duty cop from Chicago.

31:49.220 --> 31:50.980
听着  我正经过安大略机场
Listen, I'm walking through Ontario Airport,

31:51.050 --> 31:53.620
2号集散站  就在票务柜台旁
Terminal 2, right by the ticket counters

31:53.680 --> 31:54.780
我发现有情况
and I just saw something

31:54.850 --> 31:56.520
你们一定要查一下
that you guys definitely want  check out.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.550
有人过来了
We got company.

31:59.620 --> 32:03.080
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德和林肯·布伦斯
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows.

32:03.150 --> 32:04.050
我们走
Let's get out of here.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.280
慢着
No, no, no...

32:05.350 --> 32:06.850
你不会想要跑的
The last thing you want to do right now is run

32:06.920 --> 32:08.680
怎么  你会开枪吗
Why is that? You gonna shoot us?

32:08.750 --> 32:09.920
没错
Yeah.

32:09.980 --> 32:12.080
一声令下  我的人就会把你们带走
I say the word and my men will take you both out.

32:12.150 --> 32:13.220
在这么多人面前吗
In front of all these people?

32:13.280 --> 32:15.380
你们不敢这么张扬的
You'd never risk that kind of exposure.

32:15.450 --> 32:17.550
我觉得现在已经很明朗了
I think it's clear by now

32:17.620 --> 32:20.880
你错误估计我们的限度了
that you've miscalculated how far we're willing to go.

32:22.050 --> 32:23.520
把包给我
Give me the bag.

32:32.420 --> 32:34.090
马上就把包给我
Give me the bag. Now.

32:50.020 --> 32:52.260
告诉克兰兹事情还没完
Tell Krantz this isn't finished.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.620
你可以亲自告诉他
Oh, you can tell him in person.

32:54.690 --> 32:56.720
先生  请跟我们来
Sir? Please come with us.

32:56.790 --> 32:58.320
怎么了
Excuse me?

32:58.390 --> 32:59.920
安全检查而已
Just a security precaution.

33:05.890 --> 33:08.520
好吧  没问题
Yeah, sure.

33:14.890 --> 33:16.460
真的有必要吗
Is this really necessary?

33:16.520 --> 33:18.290
请把包里的东西都拿出来
Please empty the contents of your bag.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.160
我包里就一台电脑
Look, all I've got in there is a laptop

33:20.220 --> 33:21.490
和一个外接硬盘而已
and an external hard drive.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.990
告诉你  你们抓错人了
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.820
先生  放开包
Let go of the bag, sir.

33:40.820 --> 33:43.360
[善终为善]
All's well that ends well.

33:54.760 --> 33:55.860
如何
Well?

33:55.920 --> 33:57.090
我们拿着呢
Yeah, we got it.

34:07.460 --> 34:10.590
这么说你一开始就知道我是谁
So you knew who I was from the start, huh?

34:10.660 --> 34:13.560
我的真实姓名  我的记录
My real name, my record...

34:13.620 --> 34:14.960
我看过你的档案  没错
I read your file, yeah.

34:17.390 --> 34:18.620
如果你没看过呢
What if you hadn't?

34:19.960 --> 34:21.220
你想说什么
What's your point?

34:21.290 --> 34:23.060
如果你不知道
What if you never knew

34:23.120 --> 34:25.260
我是杀人犯帝博格·巴格维尔呢
I was Theodore Bagwell, the convict?

34:27.590 --> 34:29.620
你会不会相信我是科尔·普发
Would you have believed I was Cole Pfeiffer?

34:29.690 --> 34:32.420
顶级销售员
Stellar salesman...

34:32.490 --> 34:35.560
天才演说家
talented speaker?

34:35.560 --> 34:37.690
不知道
I don't know.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.920
但你确实骗了不少人
You certainly had a lot of other people fooled, though.

34:41.160 --> 34:43.260
在你拿枪指着他们之前
Till you pled a machine gun on them.

34:45.490 --> 34:49.260
我想这就像是他们在伽特所说的
I guess it's like they said over at GATE:

34:49.320 --> 34:54.660
我们都是自我的俘虏
"We are captives of our own identities,

34:54.720 --> 34:58.690
禁锢在自己创造的监狱里
living in prisons of our own creation."

35:04.420 --> 35:06.960
谁会想到此话
Who would've thought they'd actually

35:07.020 --> 35:08.990
一语中的
be right about something?

35:11.460 --> 35:13.360
你要是把它弄丢了
So if you drop this,

35:13.420 --> 35:15.260
我们是不是都得回监狱
does that mean we all go back to prison?

35:15.320 --> 35:17.720
别担心
Don't worry.

35:17.790 --> 35:20.290
要是让它落入坏人手中
If this doesn't get in the right hands in one piece,

35:20.360 --> 35:22.820
我的处境也会跟你们一样
I'm going to be in as bad a spot as you are.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.190
恭喜你们
Congratulations.

35:30.890 --> 35:33.360
怎样
What now?

35:33.420 --> 35:36.320
我要遵守我之前的承诺
Now, I live up to my end of the deal.

35:36.390 --> 35:38.290
半小时后  有辆车会来接你们
The vans are going to be here in a half an hour.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.020
去驻外办事处
They're going to be sent to a field office

35:40.090 --> 35:41.920
按程序搞掂一切
where you can go through processing.

35:41.990 --> 35:44.490
这是你们的迁移文件
Th is all your transfer papework.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.490
拿这个去找施密特探员
Get this to an Agent Schmidt.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.020
他会护送你们安全离开
He's going to be heading up the convoy.

35:48.090 --> 35:49.690
我很想亲自送你们
I wish I could drive you myself,

35:49.760 --> 35:51.890
但我得尽快赶到达洛斯那边去
but I need to get to Dallow ASAP.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.120
你还好吗
Are you okay?

35:55.190 --> 35:57.120
还好
Yeah, I'm okay.

35:57.190 --> 35:59.120
不  他不好
No, he's not.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.660
他需要去医院
He needs to go to a hospital.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.190
我再安排一辆救护车过来
All right, I'm going to send an ambulance with the vans.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.660
给你安排最好的医疗救治
You're going to get the best medical care available.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.660
谢谢你
Thank you.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.860
不  应该感谢你们才对
No, I should be thanking you.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.220
由于你们的功劳
Okay, because of what you've done,

36:12.290 --> 36:14.260
生活将从此改变
lives are going to be changed forever.

36:39.420 --> 36:42.690
再安排一辆救护车一起过来
Listen, I need a, uh, ambulance to come with the convoy.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.760
长官  下一步怎么办
Sir, what are your orders?

36:55.660 --> 36:57.660
长官
Sir?

37:00.620 --> 37:03.620
我不知道
I don't know.

37:15.620 --> 37:19.620
我们再也没有后顾之忧了
None of us will ever have to look over our shoulders again.

37:19.680 --> 37:23.350
这是最重要的
That's the most important thing.

37:23.420 --> 37:25.180
不管将来如何
No matter what comes next.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.220
迈克尔  你不会有事的
You're gonna make it, Michael.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.950
你做完手术
You'll have the operation and,

37:30.020 --> 37:32.080
就会好起来的
and you'll get through this.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.850
就像我们这一路走来一样
Just like we've gotten through everything else.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.350
她很担心你
She's worried about you.

38:01.420 --> 38:05.680
我很开心下一次想喝酒的时候
It's nice to know that the next time I want to drink one of these,

38:05.750 --> 38:08.150
不用在这破仓库里喝
I won't have to drink it in this crappy warehouse.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.520
没错
Yeah.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.650
我都不记得上次坐在餐厅或去打球
I can't even remember being able to sit down at a restaurant

38:19.720 --> 38:22.050
是什么感觉了
or go to a ball game.

38:23.580 --> 38:26.680
天啊  就像这辈子都在逃亡
God... it seems like I've been running forever.

38:26.750 --> 38:28.750
现在该停下来
But time to stand still.

38:28.820 --> 38:30.780
好好享受了
Take in the sun.

38:32.550 --> 38:34.520
干杯
Salud.

38:43.720 --> 38:46.650
我知道现在应该开心才对
I know I'm supposed to be happy right now.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.350
但我还是很害怕
I'm still scared.

38:51.220 --> 38:53.220
我害怕经历过这么多
I'm scared we're going to have come all this way

38:53.280 --> 38:54.680
我还会失去你
and I'm going to lose you anyway.

38:56.220 --> 38:57.850
过来
Come here.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.350
过来
Come on.

39:01.420 --> 39:02.750
莎拉
Sara...

39:02.820 --> 39:04.080
别跟我说
Just don't tell me

39:04.150 --> 39:06.580
一切都会好起来
that everything's going to be okay, please.

39:07.650 --> 39:09.620
好的
Okay.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.920
我不会说的
I won't.

39:33.450 --> 39:34.920
你把你的"朋友"带来了
I see you brought your friend along.

39:34.980 --> 39:36.780
格雷琴呢
What happened to Gretchen?

39:36.850 --> 39:38.380
她跑了
Uh, she got away.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.450
就是这个
So here it is.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.880
什么
Wha...?

39:47.120 --> 39:49.850
天啊
Oh, my God.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.020
简直不敢相信
Wow. I can't believe it

39:52.080 --> 39:53.420
接下来呢
So what's next?

39:53.480 --> 39:55.050
找达洛斯议员
Senator Dallow?

39:55.120 --> 39:57.050
不  我还需要处理一些琐事
No, I need to tie up some loose ends.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.680
格雷琴和巴格维尔提过"锡拉"的其他事吗
Did Gretchen and Bagwell say anything else about Scylla

39:59.750 --> 40:01.780
-例如其他买主  -冯
in terms of other buyers? Feng.

40:01.850 --> 40:03.080
他已经死了
He's dead.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.820
他们没和其他人说过吗
They didn't talk to anyone else?

40:05.880 --> 40:07.250
我们要尽量搜集证据
We need to get as many indictments

40:07.320 --> 40:08.480
指控他们
on this thing as possible.

40:08.550 --> 40:09.980
巴格维尔可能知道
Well, Bagwell might know.

40:10.050 --> 40:12.320
只要在审问时给他点甜头
Once we get him in an interview room and offer him a deal,

40:12.380 --> 40:14.780
他就会说的
his mouth will start moving.

40:32.850 --> 40:35.420
还记得我们来的第一天我说的话吗
Remember what I said to you the first day we got here?

40:37.650 --> 40:39.450
记得  你说等这一切结束了
Yeah, you said that when this was over,

40:39.520 --> 40:41.120
我们再做个了断
we were gonna settle up.

40:42.620 --> 40:43.780
我们已经两清了
We're settled.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.620
迈克尔
Michael.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.880
都一个小时了
It's been an hour.

40:49.950 --> 40:52.120
你能给赛尔夫打电话看救护车什么时候来吗
Would you call Self and check on that ambulance?

41:04.550 --> 41:06.450
他不接电话吗
Is he not picking up?

41:07.780 --> 41:09.820
可能是信号不好
Maybe something's wrong with the signal.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.480
你所拨打的电话不在服务区
The number you have reached is not in service at this time

41:14.550 --> 41:16.350
此号码为空号
and there is no new number.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.020
怎么了
What is it?

41:32.050 --> 41:34.220
你做的很好  米里亚姆
You did really good on this one, Miriam.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.750
你很坚强
You really held your own.

41:38.250 --> 41:39.550
谢谢夸奖
Thank you.

41:41.180 --> 41:43.680
我能仔细看看那东西吗
Can I take a closer look at that?

41:51.120 --> 41:52.720
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

41:52.720 --> 41:57.720
