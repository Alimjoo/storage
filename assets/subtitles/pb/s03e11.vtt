02:18.810 --> 02:20.450
那是惠斯勒的女友?
Is that Whistler's girlfriend?

02:21.590 --> 02:23.050
她为什么呆在车里?
Why she's staying in the car?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.580

关键是惠斯勒 我们得尽一切办法

你不必知道惠斯勒究竟是什么人
You don't need to know who Whistler is.

那他有多大价值你知道吧 我儿子的命
What about what he's worth? my son's life.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.180

03:47.330 --> 03:48.550
是吗?
Is that so?

03:48.560 --> 03:50.000
显然你还不了解他
You obviously don't know him very well,

03:50.010 --> 03:51.240
大老粗
Shakespeare.

03:52.010 --> 03:54.520
当我们从福克斯河逃出来后
When we broke out of fox river,

03:54.530 --> 03:56.820
他想把我们都给毁了
He tried to screw every one of us.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.330
有一半的人
Half the men ended up either

03:58.340 --> 04:00.460
要么被杀 要么被抓 或者更糟

04:00.510 --> 04:02.940
最容易被逮到的人
The guys who are easiest to catch

04:03.180 --> 04:04.550
就是那些四处惹事或者整天哀叹
Are the one's who spend more time

04:04.560 --> 04:07.420
而不赶紧逃跑的人
Pissing and moaning at each other than running.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.090
给你的唯一建议是
My only advice to you,

传道书第六章13节
Ecclesiastes 6:13.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.910
不要使你自己和你的敌人混在一起
"separate thyself from thy enemies,

04:15.920 --> 04:18.410
多注意下你的朋友
And take heed of thy friends."

04:18.420 --> 04:19.650
干的怎样了 阿历克斯?
How we doing, Alex?

04:19.660 --> 04:22.410
如果那些柱子能撑的住的话
Well, if those braces hold,

04:23.140 --> 04:24.960
明天的某个时候
We could be to the surface

04:24.970 --> 04:25.930
我们就能到上面了
Sometime tomorrow.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.410
都动动 大家都要保持清醒
Let's rotate. keep everybody fresh.

别老让你的汗滴到我身上
Don't drop your body-water upon me like that

04:58.090 --> 05:00.240
不是我的汗 我发誓
Hey, it ain't coming from me, I swear.

工程师 过来
Engineer, come.

05:02.990 --> 05:04.520
你看看
Look at this.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.550
是碰到水管了还是怎么的?
We hit a pipe or something?

05:09.560 --> 05:10.910
哦 不妙
Oh, no.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.250
那正好是我们隧道的上方
That's right above our tunnel.

05:30.590 --> 05:32.560
撑不到明天了
That's not going to hold till tomorrow.

05:32.570 --> 05:34.050
该怎么办?
So what do we do?

05:34.310 --> 05:36.700
今晚就走
We leave tonight.

你不是说过晚上不可能成功
I thought you said a nighttime escape was impossible.

06:14.150 --> 06:16.250
如果继续下雨 隧道又会坍塌
If the rain keeps up, the tunnel will collapse again,

06:16.260 --> 06:17.900
到时就前功尽弃了
And that'll be the end of it.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.400
你就死定了
It'll be the end for you.

06:19.410 --> 06:20.860
时间不多的人是你
You're the one on a deadline.

06:20.870 --> 06:22.370
那万一在我们出去的时候坍塌呢?
What if it gives out whilwe're inside?

06:22.380 --> 06:23.140
我们岂不是都被活埋了
We end up like buried treasure.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.810
要不想去 那就滚
You want out, get out

06:28.230 --> 06:29.870
听着 要是没有大家齐心协力
Look, you're not pulling this off tonight

06:29.880 --> 06:31.800
你今晚也出不去
Without all of us working around the clock.

06:33.410 --> 06:34.140
同样的 没有他的计划
And none of us

06:34.150 --> 06:35.510
我们大家也都出不去
Are ever making it out of here

06:35.520 --> 06:37.440

想出一个今晚出去的办法
That you can figure out a way how to do this at night,

06:39.560 --> 06:41.750
那么我们都会和你一起努力
Then i we can figure out a way

06:41.760 --> 06:43.670
想办法及时挖好隧道
How to get that tunnel dug in time.

06:48.540 --> 06:50.320
开始挖吧
Let's start digging.

07:00.470 --> 07:02.090
你是不是掉了东西
I think you dropped something.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.580
我在旧报纸上读到了
I've read in old newspapers that make it to sona

美国人是如何要别人去遵守自己所丢弃的标准
How americans hold others to standards they ignore.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.280
美国人认为别人都不该有权力 除了他们自己
How they think no one should have power but them.

07:11.780 --> 07:16.150
我告诉别人 这不是真的 但其实就是真的
I tell everyone it's a lie, but I see it's true.

07:17.310 --> 07:18.970
我知道你要走了
I know you're leaving.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.750
那我想 我为你做了那么多
And I think that after everything I've done to help,

07:22.850 --> 07:25.150
你居然不带上我 你太无耻了
I think it sucks you're not taking me with you

07:26.680 --> 07:28.190
我知道你现在不明白
I know it doesn't seem like it now,

07:28.200 --> 07:30.630
但其实我是在帮你 送了你一份大礼
But I'm doing you a favor. I'm giving you a gift.

这比四处逃亡要好
It's better than a life on the run.

我不属于这 我只不过
I don't belong here. all I did was give a guy

I'm just going to grab my stuff.

08:09.170 --> 08:13.620
是啊 或许对你和詹姆斯来说 消失是最好的了
Yeah. probably best if you and James disappear.

08:13.630 --> 08:16.300

08:16.480 --> 08:18.330

祝你好运
Good luck.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.610
你也是
You, too.

08:30.180 --> 08:31.780
又是苏珊那娘们
Hey, it's that Susan chick.

08:31.790 --> 08:33.500
她又找我了
She wants to meet again.

08:33.510 --> 08:34.480
好的

08:34.490 --> 08:35.810
告诉她一切正常
Let her know everything's on track.

08:35.820 --> 08:38.440
让她尽可能感到踏实
We want to make her feel as comfortable as possible.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.710
她为何会不踏实?
Why shouldn't she be?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.200
她明天就能得到她要的人了 是吧?
She's going to get her guy tomorrow, right?

08:41.210 --> 08:44.210
是的 只要迈克的良知不惹麻烦的话
Well, if Michael's conscience doesn't get in the way.

08:45.770 --> 08:47.060
什么意思?
What do you mean?

08:47.390 --> 08:48.930
他有顾虑
He's having doubts.

08:48.940 --> 08:49.860
关于是否能够尽快逃走
About if he can pull it off?

08:49.870 --> 08:51.820
如果必要的话
About if he should.

08:51.940 --> 08:54.460
但是他一定可以成功的 是吧?
But he's going to go through with it, right?

09:07.260 --> 09:08.740
你在找什么
What are you looking for?

09:09.090 --> 09:12.340
找给索纳监狱外部的灯供电的电线
Where the power lines connect to Sona's exterior lights.

09:13.130 --> 09:15.010
如果切除电源以后会有逃亡的机会
If cutting the power out there was an option,

09:15.020 --> 09:16.380
为什么我们没有一开始就这样做
Why didn't we do that in the first place?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.710
首先 那里的电源不是这里所能控制的
One, the power out there isn't controlled from in here.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.690
其次 还有那个东西
And, two, there's that.

09:22.530 --> 09:23.950
每个监狱都有一个后备的发电机
Every prison has a backup generator.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.950
就算我们切断了电源 它们还会再亮
Even if we cut the lights, they'll just come back on again

09:26.960 --> 09:29.180
立刻
Immediately.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.080
好吧 这是一个严肃和残酷的问题
Well, that's a big, bloody problem.

09:32.390 --> 09:34.370
告诉勒齐我需要他的电话
Tell Lechero I need his phone.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.620
计划有变 林肯
Change of plans, Linc.

09:38.630 --> 09:40.120

09:40.130 --> 09:42.730
今晚? 发生了什么事情 迈克
Tonight? what happened, Michael?

09:42.740 --> 09:44.680
雨 泥土 地道 都是问题
Rain, dirt, tunnel, problem.

09:44.690 --> 09:45.980
-地道还能支持多久? -看情况
How long can it hold?

09:45.990 --> 09:47.120
那要看情况了
That depends

09:47.130 --> 09:48.740
看什么情况?
Depends on what?

09:49.960 --> 09:52.210
根据雨停的时间
When the rain stops.

09:52.220 --> 09:55.010
你说过晚上越狱是不可能的
You said breaking out at night was impossible.

09:55.020 --> 09:56.190
是说过 不过
Yeah, well

09:56.200 --> 09:58.730
告诉我你想怎么摆平这个问题
You want to tell me how you're going to pull this off?

09:58.740 --> 10:01.230
首先 我需要苏克雷的帮助
For starters, I need to get ahold of Sucre.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.900
苏克雷 你知道我干什么谋生吗
Sucre, do you know what I do for a living?

10:17.670 --> 10:19.590
我有一个好主意
I have a pretty good idea.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.330
我能读懂人
I read people.

10:21.340 --> 10:24.750
而且你 我的朋友 像是一本多彩的书
And you, my friend, are a coloring book.

10:26.820 --> 10:27.600
我觉得
I think you left

10:27.610 --> 10:29.390
你把这个掉到我的车里了
This in my car.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.180
这个只是 我的意思是
Look. that that was just I mean

10:32.190 --> 10:34.100
不用解释
No. no, no, no, no.

10:34.580 --> 10:35.990
是我的错
My fault.

10:36.420 --> 10:38.660
我猜我给你布置任务的时候
I guess I just didn't make myself clear

10:38.670 --> 10:41.040
你没有听懂
When I laid out the terms of our arrangement.

10:41.170 --> 10:44.570
所以我现在得再尽可能简洁的讲一次
So I'm going to try again as simply as I know how.

10:44.780 --> 10:46.650
如果有任何事发生
Anything happens

10:46.660 --> 10:49.810
只要是我不希望发生的事情
Anything at all that I wasn't expecting

10:49.820 --> 10:50.860
那么芝加哥就会少一个
And there will be one less

10:50.870 --> 10:52.350
怀孕的女孩
Pregnant girl in chicago.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.280
你看 迈克和林肯什么也没告诉我
Look, Michael and Lincoln don't tell me everything.

10:55.290 --> 10:57.150
费尔南多这是你最后一次机会了
Fernando, this is your last chance.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.690
只要你说是或者不是
I want a yes or a no.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.060
那兄弟两人是不是将要把惠斯勒带出索纳
Are the brothers gonna break Whistler out of Sona?

11:02.070 --> 11:03.240
是的
Yes.

11:03.250 --> 11:06.230
而且他们打算把他交给我?
Are they planning on handing him over to me?

11:07.720 --> 11:09.220
是的
Yes.

11:10.850 --> 11:13.360
你希望我先打中玛丽克鲁兹哪个部位?
Where do you want me to shoot Maricruz first,

11:13.450 --> 11:16.120
打后脑还是臀部?
In the bun or in the oven?

11:16.130 --> 11:17.550
好吧
Okay

11:23.650 --> 11:25.690
我听说一件事情
There's one thing I heard.

11:25.700 --> 11:29.960
是关于迈克的事情 他对 惠斯勒有些担心
It's Michael. he's, he's having some concerns about Whistler.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.930
担心他什么?
What kind of concerns?

11:32.480 --> 11:34.550
关于把他交给你的事情
About handing him over.

11:36.340 --> 11:37.870
你得知道
You got to understand,

11:37.880 --> 11:40.230
上次他越狱带出了一群坏蛋
He broke out some pretty bad guys last time.

11:40.510 --> 11:43.150
我想他自今都没有原谅自己
I think he's never forgiven himself for that.

11:44.020 --> 11:46.110
他打算把惠斯勒留下?
He's planning on leaving him behind?

11:46.180 --> 11:47.680
可能吧 我不知道
Maybe. I don't know.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.010
嘘
Shh.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.440
你好 林肯
Hello, Lincoln.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.680
今晚就要行动了
It's going down tonight.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.820
今晚?
Tonight?

12:03.320 --> 12:04.920
我应该担心吗
Should I be worried?

12:05.410 --> 12:07.200
我一收到消息就打给你了
I called you first thing.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.950
我说的全是真的
I'm being straight up with you.

12:09.230 --> 12:11.100
这真是令人高兴
That's refreshing.

12:11.110 --> 12:13.340

12:19.460 --> 12:20.920
今晚就要行动了

12:21.200 --> 12:23.040
你知道吗
Do you know about that?

12:23.350 --> 12:25.110
我发誓我不知道
I didn't know, I swear.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.230
滚出去
Get out of here.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.570
怎么样了?
How'd it go?

12:45.580 --> 12:47.040
她找到那个炸弹了 林肯
She found the bomb, Linc.

12:47.050 --> 12:48.820
那个我们丢在她车里的
The one we put in her car.

12:49.050 --> 12:50.810
她怎么找到的 苏克雷
How did she find the bomb, Sucre?

12:50.820 --> 12:52.800
我不知道 兄弟 对不起
I don't know, bro. I'm sorry.

12:52.810 --> 12:54.370
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

12:54.380 --> 12:55.570
今后我会补偿的
Look, I'llak mit

12:55.580 --> 12:56.910
我发誓
Up to you, I swear.

12:57.380 --> 12:58.300
你可以开始了
You can start now.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.230
迈克在索纳遇到一点麻烦
Michael's in a bit of trouble in Sona.

13:00.690 --> 13:02.280
什么样的麻烦?
What kind of trouble?

13:06.630 --> 13:09.040
雨停了 这是不是意味着 ?
The rain stopped. does that mean ?

13:09.050 --> 13:11.530
不行 已经对隧道造成了损坏
No. the damage is done.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.500
我们不能冒险等着
We can't risk waiting.

13:19.870 --> 13:21.330
有什么有趣的事情吗
Anything interesting?

13:21.920 --> 13:23.280
比如一些公司想要染指的
Like some coordinates

13:23.290 --> 13:25.330
坐标
The company might want to get their hands on?

13:26.900 --> 13:28.990
如果他们不想让我出去
If they didn't want me out of here

13:29.660 --> 13:33.940
而且你的侄儿是安全的 你还会这样做吗?
And yourephew was safe, would you still be doing this?

13:33.950 --> 13:35.380
越狱?
Breaking out?

13:36.460 --> 13:38.270
不会
No.

13:38.430 --> 13:42.600
为什么在有机会自由的时候你仍选择留下呢
Why would you choose to stay if there was a chance at freedom?

13:42.610 --> 13:45.280
我认为这就是我们之间的区别
Well, I guess that's the difference between us.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.700
我愿意偿还我犯下的罪
I'm willing to pay for my sins.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.590
你认为我不愿意?
And I'm not?

13:49.630 --> 13:51.590
这是个不错的问题
That's a good question.

13:59.790 --> 14:02.030
水进来的很快 同志
Water's coming down pretty fast up in here, patron.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.750
是啊 我们必须得快点挖
Yeah. we hav to dig faster.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.330
我一直在想
You know, I've been thinking.

14:07.340 --> 14:09.580
我们都不应该各为自己
It doesn't have to be every man for himself.

14:09.590 --> 14:12.550
你和我可以互相帮助
You and I can help each other.

14:13.050 --> 14:16.870
我更愿意找有2个手的助手
If I need a hand, I'll find someone with a spare.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.210
好吧 我确实
While it's true I may be lacking

14:19.220 --> 14:20.310
在某一方面少些东西
Something inhe west,

14:20.320 --> 14:22.880
不过我会在另一方面弥补
I more than make up for it in the north.

14:22.890 --> 14:24.050
考虑一下吧
Think about it.

14:24.060 --> 14:29.860
斯科菲尔德让我们到这里来做苦力 奴工
Scofield's got us down here doing manual labor; slave labor.

14:30.980 --> 14:32.820
我不是奴工
I ain't no slave.

14:33.310 --> 14:34.540
我是为自己做的
I'm doing this for me.

14:34.550 --> 14:36.400
你觉得 斯科菲尔德在上面干什么
Why do you think Scofield's up there

14:36.410 --> 14:37.110
在我们做这些的时候
And we'rdoe here?

14:37.120 --> 14:38.880
他正在计划一些事情
He's planning something.

14:40.210 --> 14:42.030
我们中间谁没有自己的打算?
Who among us isn't?

14:43.940 --> 14:45.530
那是什么
What the hell is that?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.030
好吧 我们就卸在这边
Ok, let's unload it here.

15:53.280 --> 15:56.320

Make the animals walk through the filth

15:59.920 --> 16:01.390

Not long enough.

16:53.960 --> 16:54.660
我在想
I was thinking that we could

16:54.670 --> 16:56.870
我们可以私下聊聊
Have a little chat in person.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.730
确保我们对于今晚发生的事情
Make sure we're all on the same page

16:58.740 --> 17:00.110
是同步的
About what's gonna happen tonight.

17:00.120 --> 17:00.850

30分钟后 在这个地方 我会给你发消息
30 minutes, this location. I'm sending a text.

17:12.950 --> 17:15.200

17:33.380 --> 17:35.200
林肯说你需要点帮助
Lincoln said you needed some help.

17:35.330 --> 17:37.710
你对电源了解多少?
How much do you know about electricity?

17:42.530 --> 17:43.940
嘿 你回来啦
Hey, you're back.

17:43.950 --> 17:46.700
我实在觉得独自在这下面不太舒服
I'm not real comfortable being alone down here with those

17:48.330 --> 17:49.370
那是什么?
What's that?

17:49.380 --> 17:53.770
掩护 亲爱的 和一些泥浆
Syrup; honey. make a little pile of dirt.

17:53.780 --> 17:56.140
把泥土凝结起来
Gather some dirt.

17:56.350 --> 17:58.310
斯科菲尔德说我们出去以后
Scofield said we got to make

17:58.400 --> 18:00.810
必须找个东西掩盖洞口
Something to cover the hole once we get out.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.140
当灯光再亮起来的时候
So when the lights go back on

18:03.150 --> 18:05.460
就会象没有人离开过那一样
It's gonna look like nobody ever left.

18:06.110 --> 18:07.760
快干 把泥土和匀
Go ahead. spread it around.

18:09.610 --> 18:10.960
我在想
I was thinking

18:13.240 --> 18:14.550
我们应该是一起的 你知道吧?
We should be a team, yoknow?

18:14.560 --> 18:16.220
不只在越狱过程中 以后也是
Not just during the escape, but after.

18:16.230 --> 18:18.230
就像Butch和Sundance(来自一美国电影的好朋友)
Like, like Butch and Sundance.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.250
Butch和Sundance死了
Butch and sundance died.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.190
我的意思是在别的方面类似
Well, I mean in the other parts.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.410
我有个主意
Here's an idea.

18:23.420 --> 18:25.280
我们先按斯科菲尔德的计划做
We go along with Scofield's plan,

18:25.290 --> 18:26.460
然后等大家都停下来
And then when everyone stops

18:26.470 --> 18:27.840
休息时 我们就抓住他们
To take a breath, we grab 'em,

18:27.850 --> 18:29.390
布鲁斯 斯科菲尔德 蒂博格
Burroughs, Scofield, Bagwell.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.040
带他们回去接受指控
We take 'em back home to face charges.

18:31.050 --> 18:32.150
我们就成英雄了
Hell, we'd be heroes.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.480
说不定还能写本书
Might even get a book deal.

18:33.490 --> 18:35.000
阿历克斯 我们可以一起写书
We could write it together, Alex.

18:35.010 --> 18:36.560
-怎么样? -卖书?
How'd that be? a book deal?

18:36.570 --> 18:38.000

你有更好的主意?
You got a better idea?

18:42.270 --> 18:43.820
没错
Yeah, I do.

18:43.930 --> 18:45.550
你是指和老婆孩子一起?
Something to do with a wife and kid?

18:45.560 --> 18:47.110
对 差不多
Yeah, something like that.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.230
还有多余的位置给我吗?
You got room for one more?

18:50.350 --> 18:52.480
快 阿历克斯
Come on, Alex.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.230
像我这样的人会怎么做?
What's a guy like me gonna do?

18:54.960 --> 18:56.840
还是先逃出这里再说吧
Let's just let scofield get us out of here,

18:56.850 --> 18:58.980
然后我们再慢慢盘算这些 好吗
And then we'll worry about everything else, all right?

18:59.110 --> 19:00.110
好
All right.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.850
快 再多一点泥土
Come on. a little more dirt.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.000
仔细听着 按我说的做
Listen very carefully and do exactly as I tell you.

19:08.010 --> 19:09.840
你确定不想让林肯做这个?
You sure you don't want Linc to do this?

19:09.850 --> 19:12.210
他懂的比我懂的多
He knows more about this than I do.

19:12.430 --> 19:13.530
这不是谁懂的多的问题
It's not about what you know.

19:13.540 --> 19:14.600
而是你在哪工作的问题
It's about where you work.

19:14.610 --> 19:16.430
既然进了索纳工作 朋友
And as a Sona employee, my friend,

19:16.440 --> 19:18.650
唯一一个不被射杀的原因
You have the unique ability of not getting shot

19:18.660 --> 19:20.070
就是在这里工作
For being here.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.000

There should be a metal cage.

That's the backup generator.

19:39.180 --> 19:40.610

别让塔楼的警卫看到你离的太近
Don't let the tower guard see you get too close.

表现正常一点就行
Just act casual.

20:56.860 --> 20:59.000
你打算怎么对付那些巡逻车
What are you gonna do about the jeep patrols?

20:59.010 --> 21:01.100
我们必须要冒这个险
We're just gonna have to take our chances.

21:01.110 --> 21:02.930
也许不用了
Maybe you don't.

21:24.690 --> 21:25.930
你没事吧
You all right?

21:26.230 --> 21:27.760
没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:28.380 --> 21:29.540
LJ在哪?
Where's lj?

21:29.550 --> 21:32.600
安全的地方 放松点
Somewhere safe. take a load off.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.370
要来杯喝的吗
Can I offer you a drink?

21:36.080 --> 21:37.450
苏珊 什么事
What's going on, Susan?

21:37.460 --> 21:38.950
我只是想让大家一起
I just wanted to get everyone together

21:38.960 --> 21:40.710
来商量一下今晚的安排
So we can discuss tonight's agenda.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.490
或者制订个手册
Maybe nail down a few guidelines.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.160
还是和原来的一样 没有变化
It's the same as before, nothing has changed.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.580
事实上 我在想
Actually, I was thinking

21:45.590 --> 21:47.780
我们应该带上所有的参与者
We should probably include all the players.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.400
对吗
Don't you?

21:52.220 --> 21:53.730
你来干吗
What are you doing in here?

21:55.170 --> 21:56.590
放哨
Just keeping watch.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.590
确保没人去下面
Make sure nobody tries to get down to the tunnel.

22:02.490 --> 22:03.500
你在联系谁?
Who are you calling?

22:03.510 --> 22:05.950
你好 请问是客户服务吗?
Yeah, hi. is this, uh, customer service?

22:06.180 --> 22:07.540

22:07.550 --> 22:10.100
我是在巴拿马做建筑工程项目的
I'm a sub working, building down here in panama,

22:10.110 --> 22:12.530
我刚接到一个客户电话
And, um, we got a clntien-site.

22:12.540 --> 22:13.780
他们问了一些关于
They're asking questions

22:13.790 --> 22:16.200
我们安装的3210型号的发电机
About the 3210 generator we're installing.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.380
对 没错
Yeah. exactly. um

22:19.390 --> 22:21.860
他们想知道 如果关掉主电源
Anyway, they want to know, if the main power shuts down,

22:21.870 --> 22:23.520
这个发电机会在多久后
How long are they gonna be in the dark,

22:23.530 --> 22:26.580
恢复电力?
Um, before the generator kicks in?

22:26.720 --> 22:29.020
好的 谢谢
Yeah. thanks.

22:29.030 --> 22:30.210
我在线等
I'll hold.

22:30.220 --> 22:31.860
你真是个说谎高手
You're a very good liar.

22:34.660 --> 22:36.100
就是这个?
That's the timing?

22:37.430 --> 22:38.900
不 这是
No, that's, uh

22:39.320 --> 22:40.230
就这些
That's it.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.730
非常感谢
Appreciate it.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.010
怎么样?
Well?

22:45.020 --> 22:46.150
我们能搞定
We gonna make it

22:46.160 --> 22:47.240
我们应该有
We should have

22:47.250 --> 22:48.690
刚好够的时间逃走
Just enough dark to make it out.

22:49.290 --> 22:50.530
所有人一起?
With everyone?

22:52.700 --> 22:54.170
你和惠斯勒在一起?
You with Whistler?

22:55.770 --> 22:56.590
是
Yes.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.520
苏珊有话要说
Susan has got a message.

23:01.070 --> 23:03.300
为什么 让他接
Why? put him on.

23:06.380 --> 23:07.730
是给你的
It's for you.

23:13.000 --> 23:13.770
你好

23:13.780 --> 23:15.260
好的 我去找他 什么现在
All right, I got him. what now?

23:15.270 --> 23:16.630
告诉他 我要他仔细听好
Tell him I want him to listen

23:16.640 --> 23:19.410
接下来的指示
Very carefully to the following instructions.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.340
她要你仔细听
She wants you to listen real care

23:21.350 --> 23:22.070
我听到了
I can hear.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.470
什么指示
Instructions about what?

23:23.480 --> 23:24.670
詹姆斯
James?

23:24.720 --> 23:27.190
是索菲亚吗 她在吗
Was that Sofia? is she there?

23:27.330 --> 23:28.520
是的
Yeah.

23:28.660 --> 23:30.030
怎么回事
What's going on?

23:30.060 --> 23:31.580
他想知道是怎么回事
He wants to know what this is about.

23:31.590 --> 23:32.630
好吧
All right.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.050
我会告诉他
I'll tell him.

23:34.890 --> 23:36.100
不
No

23:37.690 --> 23:41.730
刚 刚刚是
Was was that just

23:41.740 --> 23:43.110
是索菲亚吗
Is that Sofia?

23:43.200 --> 23:44.780
是索菲亚吗?
Is that Sofia?

23:48.690 --> 23:49.850
你有计算出
Have you figured out

23:49.860 --> 23:51.310
正确的坐标了吗 詹姆斯
The coordinates yet, James?

23:53.870 --> 23:55.360
求你了
Please.

23:55.370 --> 23:56.560
差不多了
Almost.

23:56.570 --> 23:57.340
你没有
Wrong answer.

23:57.350 --> 23:58.670
不
No

23:59.140 --> 24:00.570
我们出来后 我会帮你找到他们的
I'll get them for you when we get out

24:00.580 --> 24:02.010
我发誓
Of here, I swear.

24:02.020 --> 24:04.410
所有你的承诺 你的保证
All your promises, your guarantees

24:04.590 --> 24:06.360
都是狗屎
They mean nothing.

24:06.370 --> 24:08.220
我已经给了充足的时间你们了
I'm pretty sick of waiting around for you boys

24:08.230 --> 24:09.920
充足的让我都要人头不保了
To screw me over.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.860
今天我必须得到这些坐标
I want those coordinates by the end of the day.

24:13.490 --> 24:14.830
不
No

24:37.000 --> 24:38.540
必须想个办法
Gotta figure it out.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.770
必须做点什么
Gotta do something.

24:40.940 --> 24:42.520
必须得做点什么了
Gotta do something.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.660
我们都明白你不能就这样把坐标给他们
We both know that you can't just hand over that information.

24:48.730 --> 24:50.710
为什么 为什么不能
Why? why can't i?

24:50.720 --> 24:51.990
一旦他们得到他们想要的
Once they get what they want,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.180
他们就没理由继续留着你了
They'll have no reason to keep you

24:54.230 --> 24:56.840
以及你的女朋友和我的侄子
Or your girlfriend or my nephew alive.

24:56.850 --> 24:58.380
那我要怎么做
So what do I do?

24:59.710 --> 25:01.110
我 我
I, I just,

25:01.120 --> 25:03.110
难道我就让他们折磨索菲亚
I just let them torture Sofia?

25:03.120 --> 25:04.890
我们会想出办法的
We'll work something out.

25:06.580 --> 25:08.280
我们会搞定的
We'll think it through.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.860
我已经有办法了
I already have.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.190
惠斯勒
Whistler

25:20.320 --> 25:21.240
惠斯勒 他到底
Whistler. what is

25:21.250 --> 25:23.900
有什么特别的
So special about him anyway, huh?

25:27.160 --> 25:29.550
你认为他和那些想让
You think he has anything to do with why them people

25:29.560 --> 25:31.300
斯科菲尔德死的人有什么关系吗
Wanted Scofield down here in the first place?

25:31.310 --> 25:33.060
这不关我鸟事
It's really none of my business.

25:33.070 --> 25:34.880
那什么是关你鸟事的 阿历克斯
What exactly is your business, Alex?

25:34.890 --> 25:36.460
你现在想的
Something on your mind?

25:37.980 --> 25:39.700
我只是说
I'm just saying

25:39.710 --> 25:41.100
如果大家要这样讨价还价 互相猜疑
If we needed a bargaining chip,

25:41.110 --> 25:42.820
你认为
Do you think

25:43.560 --> 25:46.430
他真的会帮我们逃出去吗
A sharp stick in that dull limey would help us out?

25:46.440 --> 25:48.060
不是我们
There is no"us."

25:48.070 --> 25:48.870
你和我
You and me are a lot more

25:48.880 --> 25:50.480
比你想像的更甚 阿历克斯
Alike than you think, Alex.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.560
我们都知道那是什么感觉
We both know how it feels

25:53.570 --> 25:55.160
失去一个挚爱的人
To lose a great love.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.220
杀死一个人
How it feels to kill a man.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.490
现在 我们都在这里玩完了 都是因为迈克·斯科菲尔德
And we both ended up in here because of Michael Scofield.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.340
这将是个正义的惩罚方式
Wouldn't it be poetic justice if we could just

26:05.030 --> 26:06.430
如果我们还给他
Return the favor?

26:06.620 --> 26:08.310
正义?
Justice, huh?

26:10.480 --> 26:13.090
如果这个世界上还有一点点正义的话
If there was an ounce of it left in this world

26:15.880 --> 26:18.920
你就会和你家里其他人一样
You'd be lying face down in the same unmarked grave

26:18.930 --> 26:21.500
躺在无名坟墓里
As the restof our inbred family.

26:25.930 --> 26:29.210
我们之间唯一的不同 阿历克斯 就是徽章
The only difference between me and you, Alex, is a badge,

26:29.220 --> 26:31.350
而且最后一次我发现 你根本就没有
And the last time I checked, you didn't even have that,

26:31.360 --> 26:33.980
你可以继续期待你的幸福终点 阿历克斯
So you can just keep on hoping for your happy endings, Alex,

26:33.990 --> 26:36.260
你可以继续蒙着眼罩向前
You just keep on plowing ahead with them blinders on,

26:36.270 --> 26:38.710
但是那些眼罩是
You know, but the thing abouthem blinders is

26:40.110 --> 26:43.360
很难让你向后看
It makes it really hard to watch your back.

26:51.460 --> 26:53.400
一会儿就好了 我保证
It's gonna be better soon, I promise.

26:54.730 --> 26:56.790
他是对的 如果詹姆斯
He's right, you know. if James loves you

26:56.800 --> 26:59.370
真有他说的那样爱你 他会给我们想要的
The way he says he does, he'll give us what we want,

26:59.510 --> 27:00.880
然后呢 你和你的白马王子
And then you and your white knight

27:00.890 --> 27:02.450
就可以骑马而去了
Can ride off into the sunset.

27:04.460 --> 27:06.150
除非你已经准备好要跟着他了
Unless you're already with him.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.360
你害怕了 苏珊
You scared, Susan?

27:11.010 --> 27:12.590
我看起来害怕了吗 林肯
Do I look scared, Lincoln?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.580
拔出这样的东西
To pull something like this

27:16.340 --> 27:17.280
你绝望了?
You desperate?

27:17.290 --> 27:18.930
你最好别跟我作对了
You need to stop fighting with me.

27:19.090 --> 27:19.930
如果你真的明白
If you really understood

27:19.940 --> 27:21.220
究竟发生了什么 你就会知道
What was going on, you would know that

27:21.230 --> 27:22.360
我们都不是坏人
We're not the bad guys.

27:22.380 --> 27:23.450
不能耍我
Could've fooled me.

27:23.460 --> 27:24.500
你就没有过
Haven't you ever done

27:24.510 --> 27:25.940
为了一个正确的理由做错事吗
The wrong things for the right reason?

27:25.950 --> 27:27.550
正确的理由是什么 苏珊
What are the right reasons, Susan?

27:28.020 --> 27:30.490
惠斯勒为什么就那么重要
What is it abo Whistler that's so important.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.370
我可以告诉你
I could tell you.

27:35.930 --> 27:37.450
但是然后我就要杀了你
But then I'd have to kill you.

27:39.380 --> 27:40.850
反正你不管怎么样都要那么做的
You're gonna do that anyway.

27:42.340 --> 27:43.930
如果惠斯勒给我们想要的
Whistler gives us what we want,

27:44.370 --> 27:45.920
也许我就不会了
Maybe I won't have to.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.460
林肯来电话了
Linc called.

27:54.230 --> 27:55.550
他们在路上了
They're on their way.

27:58.220 --> 27:59.510
我搞定他们
I figured them out.

28:00.590 --> 28:01.880
坐标
The coordinates.

28:03.660 --> 28:05.200
我来处理
I'm gonna hand them over.

28:05.950 --> 28:06.970
我想你应该知道
I thought you should know

28:06.980 --> 28:08.860
所以你可以做好一切预防
So you can take whatever precautions you can.

28:10.490 --> 28:11.800
如果
What if, uh

28:11.990 --> 28:13.940
如果你给他们错的坐标
What if you give them the wrong coordinates.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.080
这就会给我们赢得更多的时间
It might buy us some more time.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.130
林肯就可以带索菲亚安全离开
Maybe Linc can get Sofia to safety.

28:18.140 --> 28:19.620
就像他对莎拉一样
Like he did with Sara?

28:23.280 --> 28:24.560
很抱歉
I'm sorry. i

28:26.060 --> 28:27.450
我不是故意的
I didn't mean to.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.790
我
I, uh

28:30.100 --> 28:31.730
我只是不知道该做什么
I just don't know what else to do.

28:33.220 --> 28:34.500
我做了不对
I'm damned if I do.

28:34.570 --> 28:35.910
不做也不对
I'm damned if I don't.

28:36.560 --> 28:37.680
不可能赢的
There's way to win.

28:37.690 --> 28:38.860
这不是关于胜负了
It's not about winning anymore.

28:38.870 --> 28:40.160
这是关于生存
It's about surviving

28:40.170 --> 28:41.080
如果放弃了
Which is not the same

28:41.090 --> 28:42.040
后果不同
As giving up.

28:42.050 --> 28:43.700
但是你可以温文尔雅的走
But you can go gracefully.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.310
很荣耀
There's honor.

28:46.390 --> 28:47.950
去保护你爱的人
Protecting the ones you love.

28:48.170 --> 28:50.880
荣耀太奢侈了 我们都负担不起
Honor's a luxury men like us can't afford.

28:52.780 --> 28:55.370
你能跟我保证今晚一定会成功吗
Can you promise me we' llmake it out of here tonight?

28:55.660 --> 28:56.730
不耍花样
No games.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.390
你能真诚的跟我保证吗
Can you honestly promise me?

28:59.480 --> 29:01.770
我可以跟你保证我会尽我所能
I can promise you I'll do everything in my power.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.410
我希望那够用
I wish that were good enough.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.080
如果你做了
If you do this

29:07.240 --> 29:09.010
如果你给了那些他们想要的
If you give them what they want

29:10.020 --> 29:11.570
就统统失败了 我们就什么都不是了
Everything that's been lost

29:27.350 --> 29:28.360
怎么了
what's up?

29:28.640 --> 29:29.270
没事儿的
take it easy

29:29.280 --> 29:30.180
好的
okay

29:30.190 --> 29:31.600
没问题
no problem

29:41.700 --> 29:45.230
是的 我想要找孟赫斯警官 谢谢
yes,i'd like to speak to Officer Monjares,please

29:49.740 --> 29:52.440
孟赫斯 有你的电话
hey Arturo -phone for you

30:23.750 --> 30:25.030
我能跟你说几句话吗
can I talk to you for a minutes

30:26.140 --> 30:27.830
我有点着急
I'm kind of hurry

30:27.840 --> 30:30.110
我要去别的地方
I got some place to be

30:30.120 --> 30:32.220
要去哪里
where's that

30:34.710 --> 30:36.760
我的朋友今晚要走
Friends of mine are moving tonight

30:36.770 --> 30:38.200
他们需要我的帮助
and they need my help

30:38.210 --> 30:40.630
告诉他们你会晚点到
tell them you're gonna be late

30:42.470 --> 30:43.860
我们走吧
Let's go

30:44.330 --> 30:45.590
快走
walk

30:55.900 --> 30:57.760
惠斯勒 有访客
Whistler,you have a visitor

30:58.930 --> 31:00.950
whisler 有访客
whisler,you have a visitor

31:26.280 --> 31:28.970
他要把东西给他们
He's gonna give it to them.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.800
没事儿 我一分钟以后去看你
Relax. I'll see you in a minute.

31:30.810 --> 31:32.140
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

31:33.060 --> 31:34.740
迈克·斯科菲尔德 有访客
Michael Scofield,you have a visitor

31:35.590 --> 31:37.890
迈克·斯科菲尔德 有访客
Michael Scofield,you have a visitor

31:41.280 --> 31:41.890
我猜
I suppose

31:41.900 --> 31:43.900
现在这个时候自我介绍显得很重要
Introductions are unnecessary at this point.

31:43.910 --> 31:45.440
你在这里干什么 格雷琴
What are we doing here, Gretchen?

31:45.450 --> 31:46.790
我们来这里道别的

36:12.200 --> 36:14.490
继续呆下去会有什么好下场?

36:17.430 --> 36:18.940

放松点 没人会被射杀的

37:23.710 --> 37:24.750

37:24.760 --> 37:27.020

37:42.150 --> 37:44.630
