00:04.180 --> 00:05.450
你就不能让我来处理吗
You couldn just let me handle this?

00:05.460 --> 00:07.120
如果你的处理办法就是把"锡拉"给将军

00:07.130 --> 00:08.540

00:45.750 --> 00:49.660
我不是将军派来的

克里斯汀娜会让公司改头换面
Christina is going to change the company.

00:51.390 --> 00:52.510
她说的是  两天后
She said after two days

00:52.520 --> 00:54.220
她才会行动

她冬天才会来  所以...

我们暂时很安全
We should be fine for a while here.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.460

05:42.630 --> 05:46.350

06:07.660 --> 06:10.040
我们卸除了你的电话
We're dumping your cell phone.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.000
我们找到好几条
We've already found several phone calls

06:12.010 --> 06:15.080
你和其他组织的电话联系

06:16.920 --> 06:21.360
斯图亚特  "锡拉"在谁手里
Stuart... who has scylla?

06:21.370 --> 06:23.170
我不知道
I don't know.

06:23.410 --> 06:25.520
好好想想
Think, buddy.

06:25.530 --> 06:27.740
动脑子

06:27.750 --> 06:30.020
我发誓我真的不知道

06:30.030 --> 06:34.480
我可以让你毫无痛苦地死去
This can be as painless As you want it to be.

06:35.450 --> 06:38.760
"锡拉"在谁手里
Who has scylla?

06:40.180 --> 06:43.770
你对这件事有点偏激了
You have gone around the bend on this.

06:43.780 --> 06:47.450
我还没开始呢
I haven't even started yet.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.930
林肯  这个人不是想伤你
come on, linc, this guy wasn't trying to hurt you.

06:55.940 --> 06:59.010
他只是讨厌你的纹身
He just didn't like your tattoo.

06:59.860 --> 07:01.100
-你真有意思  赛尔夫  -狙击手的电话记录里
You're a funny guy, self -there's a lot of calls

07:01.110 --> 07:03.360
有个不明电话打了很多次
On the sniper's cell from a blocked number.

07:03.370 --> 07:05.360
得让公司帮我们查
We'll need the company to help identify it.

07:05.370 --> 07:07.660
万一是你妈的电话呢  林肯
What if it's your mom's cell phone, linc,

07:07.670 --> 07:09.160
我们得去拜访一下
And we have to pay a visit?

07:09.170 --> 07:10.690
你敢去吗
You got the gumption?

07:17.100 --> 07:19.170
喂
Yeah.

07:19.180 --> 07:22.790
林肯  我不喜欢主动打电话给你
Lincoln, i don't like having to initiate these calls.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.880
那就别打  我们找到了再打给你
Well, don't. we'll call you when we get it.

07:24.890 --> 07:27.930
"锡拉"在谁手里
Who has scylla?

07:27.940 --> 07:28.880
我们不知道
We don't know,

07:28.890 --> 07:30.430
但我们找到了一个狙击手
But we tangled with a sniper.

07:30.440 --> 07:34.940
你们现在正在审问吗
Whom you're interrogating right now, right?

07:34.950 --> 07:36.520
他死了
He's dead.

07:36.530 --> 07:38.140
林肯  我们的行动目标
Lincoln, the point of this action

07:38.150 --> 07:41.640
不是去杀人
Is not to kill as many of them as you can!

07:42.570 --> 07:44.450
你的方法让我怀疑
Your methods make me question

07:44.460 --> 07:46.400
你有没有能力
Whether you are capable of playing

07:46.410 --> 07:48.530
来领导这么大的行动
On a field of this size.

07:48.540 --> 07:49.580
我们会找到"锡拉"
We'll get scylla.

07:49.590 --> 07:53.310
我今天就要答案
I want answers today.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.460
你是不是有些话不敢说
Aren't you leaving something out,

07:57.470 --> 07:59.960
一些有点敏感的话题  比如说
Something a tad critical, like it's your mom

07:59.970 --> 08:01.750
"锡拉"就在你妈的手里
Who has scylla, hmm?

08:01.760 --> 08:04.220
-你想多了  -那我们就谈谈
Don't think too much. let's talk about that.

08:04.230 --> 08:06.080
是我想多了吗
Let's talk about thinking too much, okay?

08:06.090 --> 08:07.140
你跟将军拖延时间  
Are you stonewalling the general 'cause it's good

08:07.150 --> 08:08.750
是为了我们大家  还是为了
For the team here, or are you protecting the woman

08:08.760 --> 08:11.760
当初生你的那个女人
Who popped you out lo these many years ago, huh?

08:11.770 --> 08:14.710
要不是克兰兹让你来  我就杀了你
If krantz didn't put you here, i'd kill you.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.770
住手
All right, all right!

08:17.270 --> 08:19.010
这就是我想要的答案
There's my answer.

08:19.020 --> 08:22.350
如果告诉克兰兹"锡拉"在克里斯汀娜手里
if we tell krantz That christina has it, he may know things that'll

08:22.360 --> 08:24.240
他要么会帮我们  要么觉得我们不再有利用价值
help us or he may determine that we're no longer useful.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.010
大家明不明白
Everybody understand that?

08:26.950 --> 08:28.770
我们是来找"锡拉"的  我们一定要找到
We're here to get scylla, we need scylla,

08:28.780 --> 08:31.360
所以必须按原计划行动
And the way to do that is to stick to the plan

08:31.370 --> 08:33.270
而且不能走漏风声
And to keep our mouths shut.

08:41.300 --> 08:43.590
看这个
Hey, look at this.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.170
昨天他在亚利桑那  4号公路附近的
Yesterday he found us on interstate 10,

08:46.180 --> 08:50.330
10号洲际公路上发现我们
Near route 4 in arizona.

08:50.340 --> 08:51.800
MS是你名字的缩写
And "ms" are your initials.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.430
但剩下的部分就没什么头绪了
But the rest of this could mean anything.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.520
我去查查洛克威尔然后再想办法
I'll do a search on rockwell and we'll figure it out.

08:57.530 --> 08:59.720
假设林肯也没有什么主意
Assuming lincoln hasn't already.

08:59.730 --> 09:02.020
他在这里三天了
He's been here three days

09:02.030 --> 09:04.750
还有公司做后盾
And he's got access to company resources.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.900
如果他想要什么  那他一定能的手
And once he puts his mind to something, that's it,

09:07.910 --> 09:09.950
就算他知道他的想法是错的
Even if he figures out he's wrong.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.950
不过  目前为止
Well, and from what i've gathered,

09:12.960 --> 09:18.230
他还没这个觉悟
He doesn't think he is wrong,So...

09:23.010 --> 09:28.780
如果我是"MS"  那谁是"VS"
If i'm ms, then who's vs?

09:47.330 --> 09:50.240
孟加拉语有14个元音
Bengali has 14 different vowels.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.190
想学会真是折磨人
It's a bitch to pronounce.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.850
林肯跑掉了
Lincoln got away.

10:04.210 --> 10:07.540
你看过超新星的照片吗
Have you ever seen picture of a supernova?

10:07.550 --> 10:10.540
看过
I have.

10:10.550 --> 10:13.380
真的很漂亮
They're quite beautiful, aren't they?

10:13.390 --> 10:16.050
而且很少见  
They're very rare; they only occur

10:16.060 --> 10:20.450
50年才出现一次
About once every 50 years.

10:20.460 --> 10:25.000
还有一天  我们就能目睹这样的奇观
We're a day away from a kind of supernova.

10:27.440 --> 10:32.360
在它面前  一切都会黯然无光
A moment so powerful it'll eclipse everything.

10:32.970 --> 10:36.640
而且没有人能阻止我
And nobody's going to stop me.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.860
没有吗
No?

10:49.870 --> 10:51.230
他们还没收到
They haven't got it yet.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.790
我已经发了两次了  每次都...
Well, i've sent it twice already. either they...

10:52.800 --> 10:54.080
收到了  收到了
They got it. they got it. okay.

10:54.090 --> 10:56.630
帮我们调查狙击手的通话人
We need you to trace who called the sniper's cell

10:56.640 --> 10:58.850
还有他在迈阿密的落脚点
And tell us where he is in Miami.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.030
什么时候
Well, when?

11:00.040 --> 11:01.200
不行
No.

11:01.210 --> 11:04.110
完全不行  我们现在就要  我们...
Hell, no. we need it now. we...

11:04.120 --> 11:06.310
最快一小时
Hour earliest.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.390
什么意思  一小时
What do you mean, hour?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.860
找到他  就能找到克里斯汀娜
We get him, we get to Christina.

11:08.870 --> 11:11.450
妈的  通行证都准备好了
Damn well almost got our accsses hand to us getting this.

11:11.460 --> 11:13.130
你想知道你妈的目的吗
You want to know what your mama's up to--

11:13.140 --> 11:14.300
从那开始吧
Let's start there.

11:14.310 --> 11:15.370
这些东西是明天用的
These things're for tomorrow.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.070
我今天就要锡拉
I want scylla today!

11:17.080 --> 11:18.100
那真抱歉了  小子
Oh, sorry there, sink.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.600
我再想想吧  我的错啊
Then i go thinking again. my bad.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.090
市区港口见  Michael

11:36.600 --> 11:37.920

11:37.930 --> 11:40.670
我要把你救出去

11:47.140 --> 11:48.850

11:53.610 --> 11:56.350
不可能的

11:57.180 --> 11:59.720
我警告过他不要来
I warned him not to come.

12:20.790 --> 12:22.780

12:26.510 --> 12:27.710
他不来
He's not coming.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.460
你现在和他是一伙了
So you're working with him now?

12:29.470 --> 12:31.650
是公司的人了

12:33.470 --> 12:34.630
对  没错

12:34.940 --> 12:36.230
你来这干吗
Why are you here?

12:36.240 --> 12:37.260
首先想警告你
Partly to warn you.

12:37.270 --> 12:38.820
那你就白来了
I could have saved you the trip.

12:38.830 --> 12:41.020
因为我们要决战到底
'Cause we're seeing this thing through.

12:41.030 --> 12:42.190

12:42.200 --> 12:43.740
你认为这一切是什么

12:49.200 --> 12:51.200
锡拉在她手上

12:55.840 --> 12:56.950
他不会来的
He's not coming.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.790
他自己保命都很艰难
He's a little too busy trying

12:58.800 --> 12:59.950
因为你的...

12:59.960 --> 13:01.340
你母亲要杀他

What they want here. we don't have to chose between

13:17.450 --> 13:19.310
挽救家庭和推翻公司之间选择

Does this change anything?

14:22.850 --> 14:25.340
不能
No.

14:25.350 --> 14:27.540
她从公司内部
The fact that she thrived

14:27.550 --> 14:29.880
兴起并控制公司  代价却是

14:29.890 --> 14:32.470
其他所有人的性命
Everyone else...

14:34.810 --> 14:38.540
