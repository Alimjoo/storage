现在 你听好了
Now, you watch it.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.300
在这里我还是老大
I'm still boss here.

12:24.700 --> 12:25.800
谁还在乎老大是谁?
Who cares about who's boss?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.090
你还想从这里出去吗?
Do you want to get out of here,

12:27.100 --> 12:28.300
或者你想在这里喋喋不休?
Or do you want to keep talking about it?

12:31.900 --> 12:32.600
没事
It's okay.

12:32.700 --> 12:33.900
我们只是需要把这块撑起来
We just need to brace it.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.000
不 我们需要结构工程师
No. we need the engineer.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.500
把它挪开
Move it.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.200
萨米回来之前 我们赶快离开这里
Let's get out of here before Sammy gets back.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.600
阴凉处华氏98度 笼子里边125度
98 degrees in the shade, 125 in the box.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.490
让我们进去 找个空调房间
Let's go inside. we'll have a chat

13:03.500 --> 13:04.900
好好谈谈
In the air conditioning.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.500
明天会更热
Tomorrow is going to be hotter,

13:06.900 --> 13:08.600
后天 就像小火炉一样
The next day, even hotter.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.800
大后天 你就会成一具死尸
The day after that, you'll be dead.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.500
你不明白
You don't understand.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.000
如果我认为你能帮我
If I thought you could help me

13:16.800 --> 13:17.700
我能够
I can.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.790
你不明白我在这个省
You're unaware of the influence

13:19.800 --> 13:21.300
的庞大关系网
I have in this province.

13:21.300 --> 13:25.300
你希望我是你的盟友而不是敌人 不是吗?
You'd rather I be your ally than your enemy, wouldn't you?

13:25.300 --> 13:26.700
你不了解这些人
You don't know these people.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.700
我们无法阻止他们 至少你不能
We can't stop them not you,

13:30.400 --> 13:31.700
也不是我
Not me.

13:33.800 --> 13:37.090
曾经有个人 一个大毒枭
There was a man a drug kingpin

13:37.100 --> 13:38.900
巴拿马最有权势的人
The most powerful man in panama.

13:39.300 --> 13:42.190
一个冷血的杀手 身后有一只由暴徒
A ruthless killer with an army of thugs

13:42.200 --> 13:43.800
小偷组成的军队
And thieves behind him.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.590
他杀害法官 警察
He killed judges and policemen,

13:45.600 --> 13:47.200
所有阻碍他的人
Anyone who stood in his way.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.900
人们说他不可阻挡 但是现在
They said he couldn't be stopped either, but now

13:49.900 --> 13:52.500
勒齐在监狱里 而我控制着这里
Lechero is in prison, and I'm in power.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.600
我决定着生杀大权 现在你的命在我手中
I decide whose life is at stake, and right now, it is yours.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.500
从我来到这儿那一刻起
From the moment I got here

14:04.500 --> 14:06.300
我就在策划越狱
I've been planning my escape.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.400
他说话了
He's talking.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.400
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

14:16.900 --> 14:18.800
要从牢笼出来 你别无选择
You can't get out of the box any other way.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.500
派直升机来的人
The people who sent the helicopters,

14:40.400 --> 14:41.290
他们和陷害我哥哥
They're the same people

14:41.300 --> 14:42.600
的是同一伙人
Who framed my brother

14:43.200 --> 14:44.200
在美国的时候
Back in the u.s.,

14:45.600 --> 14:45.990
想把我送到索纳监狱
The same people

14:46.000 --> 14:49.100
也是这伙人
Who wanted me here in sona.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.900
从而帮助一名囚犯越狱?
In order for you to break out another inmate?

14:53.200 --> 14:54.600
没错
Yes.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.400
这些是什么人?
Who are these people?

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
我不知道
I don't know,

15:00.200 --> 15:01.800
但是他们抓了我的侄子
But they have my brother's son.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.400
他们手握人质
They like to keep collateral.

15:06.450 --> 15:08.890
如果我开口 我可能会危及他的安全
I could be putting his life in danger as we speak.

15:09.710 --> 15:12.300
如果你说的是实情
If what you told me is true

15:14.340 --> 15:16.070
你可以救他
you would be saving him.

15:16.490 --> 15:18.720
我将呼叫我的军队 并且立刻布置
I would call my troops and order a search

15:18.730 --> 15:20.250
一次搜索行动
For the boy immediately.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.130
但是这个故事
But this story

15:23.260 --> 15:24.710
像小说一样
It's fiction.

15:25.030 --> 15:26.160
这是真的
It's true.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.070
这是你想要的
It's what you nted.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.130
也是我唯一能够透露的了
It's the only thing I have left to give.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.080
求求你
Please.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.860
他的名字叫LJ
His name is LJ.

15:38.950 --> 15:40.600
他只有16岁
He's only 16 years old.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.660
什么味道?
What's that smell?

15:50.290 --> 15:51.540
阿曼多雪茄
Armandos.

15:52.270 --> 15:53.850
这次东西可不便宜
These things ct money.

15:53.860 --> 15:55.870
有人给我的 但是我根本不抽这东西
Somebody gave them to me I don't even smoke those things.

15:57.530 --> 15:59.450
带些东西进监狱

你捎东西进监狱? 比如说什么? 毒品?

16:01.730 --> 16:03.150
我不知道 谁知道呢? 他付我钱

16:03.160 --> 16:05.640
-你不该继续干那事的 -我明白了 好吗?
You should have quit that job, i I know, okay?

16:05.650 --> 16:07.010
我需要为我的孩子弄点儿钱
I need some cash for my kid.

16:07.020 --> 16:08.680
玛丽克鲁兹没有保险 好吗?
Maricruz doesn't have insurance, all right?

16:08.850 --> 16:11.690
听着 我刚才看到迈克了
Listen. i I just saw Michael.

16:11.900 --> 16:14.030
-他现在被单独囚禁 -什么?
He's in solitary confinement. what?

16:14.310 --> 16:16.380
他们把他塞到广场中央的笼子里
They put him in a box out in the middle of the yard,

16:16.390 --> 16:17.570
让他自生自灭
All by himself.

16:17.580 --> 16:18.850
我无能为力
He can't do anything.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.890
事情会好转的
It's going to be okay.

16:22.780 --> 16:24.010
只会更糟
It's not going to be okay.

16:24.460 --> 16:25.790
我不知道该如何是好
I don't know what to do, man.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.360
事情已经乱套了
Everything's just fallen apart.

16:34.940 --> 16:36.130
你在看什么?
What you lookin' at?

16:36.740 --> 16:38.080
风景
The view.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.440
我不禁发觉
I can't help but notice

16:39.450 --> 16:40.970
你和勒齐成了朋友
You and Lechero made friends.

16:41.430 --> 16:42.320
他最近跟很多白种人
He's been hanging out

16:42.330 --> 16:43.900
混在一起
With a lot of white boylately.

16:44.010 --> 16:46.260
-有问题吗? -没有 但是萨米有

16:46.320 --> 16:48.010
听着 我最近仔细观察
See, I've been looking close,

16:48.020 --> 16:49.000
就像一直以来一样
Like I always do.

16:49.010 --> 16:51.040
而且我知道你们会很高兴
And I know you all would be a lot better off

16:51.050 --> 16:53.150
如果萨米可以消失
If Sammy were no longer around.

16:53.930 --> 16:54.880
那就不用去担心
Wouldn't have to worry

16:54.890 --> 16:56.760
他敏锐的嗅觉坏了你们的好事
About his snout poking in your business.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.410
那么你的建议是?
And you're suggesting ?

16:59.870 --> 17:01.810
你我都明白 这事势在必行
You and I both know it needs to happen

17:01.820 --> 17:03.990
索纳中没有多少人愿意冒险除掉萨米
There aren't many men in Sona who would take out Sammy.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.830
我心中有个合适人选
I have one particular man in mind.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.450
他欠我的
A man who owes me.

17:07.550 --> 17:10.660
但是事成之后 我要求入伙
But if I pull through, I'm in the club, guaranteed.

17:10.670 --> 17:11.930
你等着瞧好了
You're gonna see to it.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.150
好吧 走着瞧
All right.

17:14.070 --> 17:16.740
我想这笔交易你能做主
I assume you have the power to make this deal.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.490
没错

17:18.500 --> 17:19.640
成交
Agreed.

17:24.530 --> 17:25.720

17:27.120 --> 17:28.340
谢谢了

17:57.150 --> 18:00.220
听着 你跟我说的我想了很久
Look, I've been thinking about what you told me and, uh

18:00.350 --> 18:01.620
但是我不能放弃这份工作
But I can't quit my job.

18:01.630 --> 18:02.800
随你便吧
Do whatever you want to do.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.930
如果你能借我点儿现金 我就放弃这工作
Well, I would if you could kick me a few bucks, you know.

18:04.940 --> 18:06.350
我们还需要废话吗? 我告诉过你了
Are we gonna do this again? I told you.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.250
我没有现金
I don't have any cash.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.780
你希望我怎么做?
What do you expect me to do?

18:08.850 --> 18:09.720
随你便
Do whatever you want.

18:09.730 --> 18:11.130
你需要我的帮助 不是吗?
You could use my help, right?

18:11.140 --> 18:12.700
你居然为友谊收费?
You're gonna start charging me now for your friendship?

18:12.710 --> 18:13.990
还有个孩子等着我
I got a kid on the way

18:14.000 --> 18:16.230
我的孩子可能再也见不到了
And I got a kid I may never see again.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.310
喂 帮我接通格雷琴
Yeah, get me Gretchen.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.000
让我很惊讶的是
Much to my surprise,

18:35.010 --> 18:38.040
你的天方夜谭居然有些是真的
Therseems to be some degree of truth to your tale.

18:38.120 --> 18:38.410

18:38.420 --> 18:39.390
我告诉你的都是真实的
I told you is true.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.770
这点我自己会判断
That's for me to determine.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.020
那我还能说什么?
What more can I say?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.260
那个囚犯
This inmate.

18:43.270 --> 18:45.730
就是你想帮他越狱的家伙
The one who you've been sent to free.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.020
他会来证实你跟我说的一切
He should be able to verify what you've told me.

18:48.030 --> 18:51.300
他确实可以 但是我不知道他是否愿意
He should but I don't know if he will.

18:51.310 --> 18:52.430
告诉我他的名字
Tell me his na

18:55.070 --> 18:56.810
这些家伙会毫不犹豫地杀了我侄子
These pele won't hesitate to kill my nephew.

18:56.820 --> 18:59.000
我需要确定你真会竭力去找他
I need to know you're gonna do everything you can to find him.

18:59.010 --> 19:01.170
-我会的 我需要那人的名字 -你发誓
I will, but I need a name. I need your word.

19:01.180 --> 19:02.770
我发誓我会去找到那男孩
You have it. I'll find the boy.

19:02.780 --> 19:04.260
现在告诉我那人的名字
Now, the name.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.140
怎么了?
What's wrong?

19:15.520 --> 19:16.820
你为何不告诉我?
Why don't you tell me?

19:17.840 --> 19:19.090
我去过了那个寓所
I went to that apartment,

19:19.100 --> 19:20.230
你的寓所

19:20.380 --> 19:23.020
那个女人出现了 显得很了解你
And this woman showed up like she knew you.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.510
我发现了本护照
And then I found a passport.

19:27.090 --> 19:28.590
谁是格雷·米勒?
Who's gray Miller?

19:30.480 --> 19:32.060
那间寓所
That apartment,

19:33.060 --> 19:34.430
那本护照
That passport,

19:35.050 --> 19:36.260
都是为我们准备的
It's all for us.

19:38.590 --> 19:39.870
当我离开这鬼地方后
It's how we're gonna get away.

19:39.880 --> 19:40.900
这些都是为我们准备的后路
When I get out of this place,

19:40.910 --> 19:42.860
我会找个可以长相思守的方式工作
I'll be working on a way for us to be together.

19:44.190 --> 19:46.010
还记得我们一直说起的法国吗?
Remember how we always talked about france?

19:46.100 --> 19:47.250
詹姆斯
Oh, James.

詹姆斯 你让我怎么相信你?
James, how how can I believe you?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.990
我怎么再相信任何事情?
How can I believe anything anymore?

19:58.000 --> 20:01.180
惠斯勒
Whistler.

20:02.310 --> 20:03.650
只要知道
And just know,

20:03.790 --> 20:05.440
知道我爱你就行
Just know that I love you.

20:18.220 --> 20:20.180
你即将面临一些严厉的指控
You're facing some serious charges.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.280
迈克·斯科菲尔德告诉我说
Michael scofield told me

20:24.290 --> 20:25.570
牢外有人
There are some people out there

20:25.580 --> 20:27.840
下定决心要弄你出去
Who are very determined to get you out of here.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.910
他说这话什么意思?
What's he talking about?

20:32.190 --> 20:33.500
你对此一无所知?
You know nothing about this?

20:33.550 --> 20:34.780
不知道
No.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.220
斯科菲尔德是个聪明人 不过
Scofield's a smart man but, uh,

20:38.190 --> 20:39.890
他有狂想症
He's got a rabid imagination.

20:40.670 --> 20:42.280
所以你是想说他在撒谎?
So you're calling him a liar?

20:43.900 --> 20:45.360
差不多吧
More or less.

20:48.050 --> 20:50.060
我有能力去验证整件事的真假
I've been able to verify the story.

20:51.580 --> 20:53.300

20:55.750 --> 20:57.160

20:57.560 --> 20:59.750
外头是谁在负责?

We can end this right now if you can provide it.

21:07.110 --> 21:08.620

39:07.700 --> 39:09.100
你需要做个选择

39:09.800 --> 39:11.200
勒齐大限在即
Lecho's days are numbered.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.100

41:29.500 --> 41:30.700

41:34.900 --> 41:35.600
他会的
He will.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.300
他说过这话很久了
How long has he been saying that?

41:37.600 --> 41:38.590
如果你和勒齐还想像以前那样
Look if you and Lechero want to go around

41:38.600 --> 41:41.200
作威作福 那就试试看
Like an old married couple, fighting this way or that

41:41.600 --> 41:42.890
也许你要在厨房里
Maybe you li it in the kitchen.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.290

41:46.100 --> 41:46.890
否则你知道会有什么结果

41:46.900 --> 41:49.100
你只是斯科菲尔德的一颗棋子
You're gonna be taking orders from Scofield.

41:53.900 --> 41:55.600
有人什么都不想做了
Some people stop at nothing, huh?

41:56.600 --> 41:57.600
是的
Uh

42:01.300 --> 42:02.700

Which of course is exactly what you wanted.

42:07.300 --> 42:09.000
是吗?
Isn't it?

42:09.100 --> 42:09.890
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

42:09.900 --> 42:11.500
你是在引狼入室
You let the fox into the henhouse.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.200
你放弃格雷琴只有一个原因
The only reason you gave up Gretchen's name

42:14.300 --> 42:17.090
所以她会卷土重来把你带出去
Was so she could come in and pull you out of the fire.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.100
你想要我放弃她
You wanted me to give up her name.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.000
你知道不会就这样结束的
You know it doesn't end with her.

42:23.300 --> 42:24.600

42:25.100 --> 42:26.700
问题在于你怎么办?
The qutions how do you?

42:27.700 --> 42:29.590
一个新来的怎么可能
How does a simple fisherman seem to know

42:29.600 --> 42:31.300
知道这么多关于公司的事情
So much about the company?

42:31.300 --> 42:34.700
当她回来的时候 她会
When she comes back, and she will

42:37.600 --> 42:38.900
我该说什么
what am I gonna say?

42:40.900 --> 42:42.400
你想不想这样做?
You gonna do this or not?

42:45.400 --> 42:47.200
你可以给她肯定的答复
You can tell her the answer is yes.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.040
不过一旦我们出去了
But once we're out, I consider

42:49.040 --> 42:50.250
所谓人质
You collateral

42:52.010 --> 42:52.810
就没有任何意义了
Nothing more.
