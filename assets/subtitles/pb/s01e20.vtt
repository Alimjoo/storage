WEBVTT

00:02.700 --> 00:04.790
我要他24小时受到监控
I want him under 24-hour surveillance.

00:05.310 --> 00:07.690
行刑时我必须在场
I have to be there when they kill this man.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.890
你至少可以回顾一下此案
The least you could do is review his case.

00:10.780 --> 00:11.600
特伦斯
Terrence.

00:11.700 --> 00:16.280
我不能明白的是 随着事情搞得越来越糟
The thing I can't quite figure is with the crap storm this thing's become

00:16.380 --> 00:18.380
他们怎么还没杀了你
why they haven't killed you.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.480
好好享用吧
Have at it.

00:24.940 --> 00:27.420
看在你以前的份上
Now, out of respect for what you once were,

00:27.520 --> 00:29.420
今天我放过你
I'm going to let you walk away.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.860
为什么不把刀子给我呢?
Why don't you just hand me that shank you're holding?

00:46.610 --> 00:48.800
我不明白你要这个干什么
I'm not even sure why you need it.

00:48.940 --> 00:49.750
谢谢
Thank you.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.750
钥匙就在你的邮件箱里
Your keys, they were right over there by your in-box.

00:52.940 --> 00:55.520
有个维修工在外面等着
Well, you got a maintenance guy waiting outside here,

00:55.610 --> 00:59.290
说是你要他来换锁 要我叫他走吗?
says you want him to change the locks. Want me to call him off?

01:00.600 --> 01:01.830
不 叫他进来
No, send him in.

01:02.070 --> 01:03.620
给你最后一个机会 特维纳
It's your last chance, Tweener.

01:03.680 --> 01:09.000
斯科菲尔德他们那帮家伙... 他们在越狱
Scofield and his whole PI crew, they're escaping.

01:27.710 --> 01:30.570
你知道我不可能让你走得了 头儿
You know I can't let you leave here, boss.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.780
警犬
Dogs.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.710
我曾不知多少次试图逃避上头的逮捕 但都被抓
The numerous times I've been apprehended while trying to elude the authorities,

02:26.740 --> 02:29.790
就是因为这该死的警犬
it's always because of the damn dogs.

02:36.180 --> 02:38.530
你逃得了一切
Turns out you can run from just about everything in your life

02:38.560 --> 02:40.520
但逃不了你身上的臭味儿
except your own particular stink.

02:40.550 --> 02:42.850
是么 有些人可能太臭了
Yeah, well, some of us stink more than others.

02:42.980 --> 02:45.560
你大概闻起来有巧克力棒棒糖味
Kinte, you can smell like a bouquet of bonbons,

02:45.700 --> 02:47.650
除非你把这味道弄掉
but unless you get rid of your smell

02:47.740 --> 02:49.610
否则这等于给警察通信
you might as well send a note to the police

02:49.640 --> 02:51.500
给他们指明方向 或许还免了他们的"打的"费
with directions and some cab fare.

02:51.640 --> 02:52.830
他说得没错
You know, Theodore's right, man.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.630
我们都得去除体味
We gotta scrub down our cells.

02:55.730 --> 02:56.960
床铺怎么办?
What about our bunks?

02:57.050 --> 03:01.640
枕头 床单等都得去除这个味道 要不干脆换了
Pillows, sheets, everything. Either get rid of your smell or change it.

03:06.090 --> 03:07.740
我们还剩多少时间?
Well, how much time we got?

03:07.880 --> 03:09.210
-约翰?  -3天
-John?  -Three days.

03:09.350 --> 03:12.500
要把我们都弄到警卫室去工作 3天是最起码的
That's the soonest I could get us into the guards' room for PI.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.620
那时候你可以弄到警服吗?
You think you'll have the extra suits by then?

03:15.700 --> 03:17.940
可能吧 明天就应该可以弄到
Probably. They should be here tomorrow.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.380
好 我们可以走了
Good, so we're good to go.

03:19.460 --> 03:23.000
看来只需要想办法把医务室钥匙搞到就行了
how to get through that door in the infirmary.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.770
还有把林肯弄出那牢房
How to get Linc out of that box.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.500
你可以在三天内完成?
And you can do that in three days?

03:26.500 --> 03:28.310
三天已经足够
Three days should be plenty of time.

03:30.330 --> 03:32.470
我们得行动了
We got to get out of here.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.080
现在就行动
Now.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.630
我不知道怎么被他发现的 但他确实发现了
I don't know how he found it. He just did.

04:11.730 --> 04:14.790
-那个洞就这么敞开在那里?  -我尽量把它盖得没有痕迹
-So the hole's just sitting there?  -I covered it the best I could

04:14.820 --> 04:18.410
但他们迟早会发现贝利克失踪了
but it's just a matter of time before someone discovers
Bellick's missing.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.190
什么意思 贝利克失踪了?
What do you mean Bellick's missing?

04:31.440 --> 04:32.440
好 好 好
Okay, okay, okay.

04:32.530 --> 04:35.270
狐狸河地方比较大 或许一时半会儿他们发现不了
Fox River is a big place. Maybe they won't notice for a while.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.880
贝利克不下命令 这边什么事情都动不了
Nothing happens around here without Bellick's say so.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.780
很快有人就会发现他失踪的
Somebody is gonna notice that he's missing.

04:39.810 --> 04:43.340
一旦发现他失踪 他们一定会封锁这地方直到找到他为止
And when they do, they're gonna close this place down until they find him.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.620
-我们怎么办?  -天一黑下来...
-What are we gonna do?  -As soon as it gets dark, we go.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.800
-我们就走  -今晚?
-Tonight?  -Pretty,

04:48.900 --> 04:50.790
我们还没准备好今晚逃跑
we ain't ready to escape tonight.

04:50.820 --> 04:53.460
逃跑已经开始了 贝利克发现洞的那一刻就开始了
Escape already started. It started the minute Bellick found that hole.

04:53.490 --> 04:55.800
发现他失踪的时候 一切就结束了
And it's gonna end the minute they figure out that he's missing.

04:55.830 --> 04:56.800
那你留下来
Then stay!

04:58.310 --> 05:00.440
我哪天早上肯定会看到报纸上说...
I'll be sure to read the papers in the morning.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.630
他们发现有哪些人在那房间工作过
See how many years you got when they realized

05:02.660 --> 05:06.240
谁挖了地洞 得判多少年
which crew was working in that room and dug that hole.

05:08.490 --> 05:10.350
那我们具体该怎么做 伙计?
So what's the play, man?

05:11.570 --> 05:14.070
今晚能把飞机准备好吗?
Do you think you can have the plane ready by tonight?

05:14.090 --> 05:14.800
当然
Sure.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.320
-你要去厨房值班 对吗?  -是的
-You had kitchen duty, right?  -Yeah.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.140
你用什么东西洗地板的?
What'd you use to scrub down the floors?

05:19.170 --> 05:21.450
我想应该是过氧化氢之类的东西
I don't know. I think it was some peroxide, or something like that.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.430
那应该可行 你尽量拿 越多越好
That'll work. Get as much as you can.

05:23.570 --> 05:26.070
我想办法去搞钥匙
I'll work on getting us that key to the infirmary.

05:26.100 --> 05:29.260
其余的人想办法去除体味吧
The rest of you find whatever you can to get rid of the scent in your cells.

05:29.290 --> 05:31.410
如果我们进不了警卫室 这些有什么用
None of this matters if we can't get in the guards' room.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.640
我们晚饭后就走
We're gonna leave after dinner,

05:32.670 --> 05:34.540
那段时间门是开着的
during tier time when the gates are open.

05:34.570 --> 05:36.760
7:00 一个接一个 从我的房间出去
7:00, one by one, through my cell.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.150
我们本应该从警卫室走的
Whoa, whoa. No, we were supposed to go through the guards' room.

05:40.180 --> 05:41.670
在他们发现我们之前
That was going to give us a head start,

05:41.700 --> 05:43.430
我们已经有足够的逃跑时间
hours before they even found out we were missing.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.280
但如果从你的房间逃跑 时间就不多了
We leave through your cell, we ain't got no lead time.

05:45.310 --> 05:47.730
-7:00 就算到8:00 那将是...  -60分钟
-7:00. Count's at 8:00, that's only...  -Sixty minutes.

05:47.860 --> 05:51.170
60分钟内得翻过墙 并逃得越远越好
Sixty minutes to get over that wall and as far away from here as possible.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.700
他们会马上追上来的
They'll be right on our asses.

05:52.820 --> 05:57.210
停止聊天 回牢房去 户外活动时间到!
Quit your talking and start your walking. Ladies, yard time is over!

05:57.300 --> 05:59.070
他们已经在追了
They already are.

06:08.350 --> 06:09.680
一个接一个走
Come on, let's go. Hurry it up. Single file.

06:11.790 --> 06:15.140
还有一件事我们没有谈起 你兄弟
You know, there's one thing we didn't talk about out there.Your brother.

06:15.170 --> 06:17.320
我意思是 他受到了24小时监控
I mean, he's under 24-hour surveillance.

06:17.490 --> 06:20.880
我是说 即使你今晚不能把他搞出来
I'm just saying, if you can't get to him by tonight,

06:20.970 --> 06:23.160
我们也得走 这你很清楚的 是吗?
we still have to go, you know that, right?

06:47.190 --> 06:51.340
-头儿  -你想要什么?
-Hey, boss.  -What do you want?

06:51.530 --> 06:55.880
我兄弟在普通监区 他还不知道我发生了意外
My brother's in Gen Pop. He's got no clue I was in an accident.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.240
所以?
So?

06:57.440 --> 07:00.870
有什么法子我可以给他稍个信吗?
Well, is there any way I can get a message to him?

07:01.010 --> 07:03.920
有 写在你的遗嘱里面
Yeah. Put it in your will.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.840
你确定所有的点都有联系?
And you're sure all those dots connect?

07:16.940 --> 07:19.030
好 谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

07:19.130 --> 07:20.410
是谁?
Who was that?

07:20.550 --> 07:23.570
律师事物所的一个朋友 处理公司的很多业务
A friend of mine at the title company, handled a lot of my firm's business.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.190
对于布莱克福特的电话号码 她找了个地址给我
She dug up an address for that phone number in Blackfoot.

07:26.220 --> 07:27.020
在哪?
Where is it?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.520
有趣的不是那个地址 而是怎么个有趣法
It's not the where that's interesting, it's the how.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.420
原来蒙大纳的那个地方
It turns out our little place in Montana

07:31.450 --> 07:34.620
被一家海外的公司以2百万的价格买去了
was purchased for $2 million by an offshore holding corporation.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.810
那些钱买那样的地 价格应该是合理的 不是吗?
Well, that's pretty standard for a transaction that size, though, right?

07:37.840 --> 07:41.520
是的 可这家公司是由一家信用社提供资金的
Sure. Only this holding corporation was bankrolled by a trust.

07:41.660 --> 07:45.580
而那家信用社 由特伦斯·斯蒂德曼的房产出资
A trust financed by the estate of Terrence Steadman.

07:46.230 --> 07:49.960
看来我们得去布莱克福特看看了
Looks like you and I are going to Blackfoot, Montana.

08:10.210 --> 08:13.170
-今天见到贝利克了吗?  -没有 怎么了?
-Have you seen Bellick today?  -No. Why?

08:13.260 --> 08:16.270
麦柯刚在问 我想他还没来
Mack was asking. I guess he ain't showed up yet.

08:16.410 --> 08:18.170
可能迟到了
He's probably just late.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.180
贝利克? 我8年没看到他迟到过一回
Bellick? I haven't beat that guy to work in eight years.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.520
斯科菲尔德 没什么好看的 快走
Scofield, this ain't Gibsons. Move.

08:27.530 --> 08:29.600
他们已经开始怀疑了 伙计
They're already starting to ask questions, man.

08:29.630 --> 08:33.640
我们不可能在7小时内离开这里 又保证不被他们发现那事
We're not gonna make it out of here in seven hours without them finding the answers.

08:33.870 --> 08:35.680
那过氧化氢怎么样了?
How we coming with that peroxide?

08:35.870 --> 08:38.520
在院子干活之前我要用到它
I'm gonna need it before we meet up for yard duty.

08:38.540 --> 08:40.010
可能要之后才能搞到
Probably not till later.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.920
能告诉我是干什么用的吗?
You wanna tell me what you need it for?

08:51.150 --> 08:53.800
这些布鲁塞尔豆苗 你吃吗?
Makkos, you going to be eating them there Brussels sprouts?

08:53.830 --> 08:54.340
不
No.

08:55.090 --> 08:59.630
-你介意我...  -拿去吧. 他们闻起来像大便
-You mind if I...  -Take them. They smell like crap.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.000
是吗?
Do they, now?

09:12.730 --> 09:13.830
什么事?
What's up?

09:18.010 --> 09:19.870
-如果你...  -今晚
-Yo, if you got...  -Tonight.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.620
-什么?  -计划改变了
-What?  -Change of plans.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.930
为什么 发生什么事了吗?
Why, did something happen?

09:27.020 --> 09:28.060
去找苏克雷吧
Just find Sucre.

09:28.220 --> 09:30.460
他会告诉你该做些什么准备
He'll tell you what you need to do to be ready.

09:30.490 --> 09:32.780
-那...?  -今晚
-But what about the...  -Tonight.

09:40.230 --> 09:41.900
发生什么事了?
What the hell's going on?

09:41.990 --> 09:44.090
总统改主意了
The President changed his mind.

09:44.180 --> 09:46.930
有保证说他一定会否决这个能源议案
We were given assurances he would veto the energy bill.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.290
"保证"会告诉你一个人会怎么做
Assurances can tell you everything that a man is going to do

09:50.380 --> 09:53.920
但有效期至第二天早上他醒来改变主意的时候
until he wakes up in the morning and changes his mind.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.980
-那就改回来  -你没听明白
-Then change it back.  -I don't think you understand.

09:57.150 --> 10:00.300
-总统...  -你喜欢我们的支持吗?
-The President...  -Have you enjoyed our support?

10:01.760 --> 10:02.660
是的
Yes.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.900
好 我们当然不会让你觉得这是理所当然的
Good. We certainly wouldn't want you to take it for granted.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.570
-你在威胁我?  -怎么了?你觉得受到威胁了?
-Are you threatening me?  -Why? Do you feel threatened?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.490
卡罗琳 这些我们都经历过
Caroline, we've all been through this before,

10:11.520 --> 10:13.580
政治道德的潮起潮落
the ebbs and flows of political conscience,

10:13.610 --> 10:16.860
但到了最后 我们总能得到我们想要的
but we've found at the end of the day we get what we want.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.870
这只是个"谁帮我们"的问题
It's simply a matter of who helps us get it.

10:18.900 --> 10:22.530
如果你不能说服那糟老头(总统)完成他的第二个任期
If you can't convince a doddering old fool finishing up his second term

10:22.620 --> 10:25.020
从国家的经济利益考虑 问题在于...
what the best thing is for this country's economy,

10:25.050 --> 10:28.390
也许你不是我们要找的那个人
perhaps you're not the kind of helper we're looking for.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.520
莎拉... 我在想...
Sara. I was thinking about something...

10:48.610 --> 10:49.700
够了 迈克尔
Enough, Michael.

10:49.930 --> 10:53.220
所有的谎言 巧合 故事 都已经够了
Enough with the lies and the coincidences and the stories, all of it.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.170
-事实不是你想像的那样  -我知道你干了什么
-It's not what you think.  -I know what you did.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.260
问题是 你有没有勇气去承认它?
The question is, are you man enough to admit it?

10:59.420 --> 11:00.530
那钥匙
The keys.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.920
祝贺你
Congratulations.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.040
这是你第一次跟我说实话吗? 
Is that the first time you've been honest with me?

11:06.070 --> 11:07.690
-这不是...  -第二次?
-It's not...  -The second?

11:07.860 --> 11:09.570
你到底想干什么 迈克尔?
What are you after, Michael?

11:09.710 --> 11:12.140
为了药物? 还是注射器?
Is it drugs? Is it needles?

11:12.310 --> 11:14.790
-都不是  -那是为了什么?
-Neither.  -Then what?

11:17.980 --> 11:21.510
请你明白 我不是本意要...
Please understand that I never meant...

11:22.820 --> 11:25.160
我从没想过要把你卷进来的
I never wanted to involve you in this.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.680
那你做得确实是有点差的
Well, you've done a pretty poor job of that.

11:27.790 --> 11:30.020
我来这是来告诉你点事儿
I came here to tell you something.

11:31.370 --> 11:34.000
我要把我哥哥弄出去
I'm getting my brother out of here.

11:34.140 --> 11:35.230
今晚
Tonight.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.300
我需要你的帮助
And I need your help.

11:55.700 --> 11:59.320
迈克尔 老实跟你说 为了你自己 不要再说了
Michael, honestly, for your own good, don't say anything more.

11:59.420 --> 12:00.650
你知道他是无辜的
You know he's innocent.

12:00.790 --> 12:02.630
他如果按你说的做 他就不无辜了
Do what you're talking about and he won't be.

12:02.660 --> 12:03.680
但他至少还活着
But he'll still be alive.

12:03.710 --> 12:06.540
你明白我有责任向上头汇报一切
You understand that I'm required to report everything you're telling me.

12:06.570 --> 12:08.050
-是的  -那你为什么还?
-Yes.  -Then why would you?

12:08.140 --> 12:09.910
因为你是唯一一个能帮我的人
Because you're the only one that can help.

12:09.940 --> 12:11.960
因为我知道 你想要成为解决问题的一部分
And because I know you want to be part of the solution.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.150
协助和煽动可算不上解决问题的一部分
Yeah, aiding and abetting is not part of the solution.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.720
知道真相却置之不理 也算不上解决问题的一部分
Neither is doing nothing knowing what you know about his case.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.180
你竟敢把这些强加于我
How dare you put this on me.

12:18.290 --> 12:20.720
我做了我所能做的 我把资料给我父亲看了...
I did what I could. I gave my father the information...

12:20.750 --> 12:23.720
没有冒犯之意 但那些陷害林肯的家伙
No offense to your father, but the people who are framing Lincoln,

12:23.750 --> 12:26.520
可以说是有相当高的安全警戒线
let's just say they have a higher security clearance.

12:26.610 --> 12:28.090
照你说这成阴谋了?
So now it's a conspiracy?

12:28.220 --> 12:29.860
我不是来这里跟你争的
I didn't come here to have a debate.

12:29.890 --> 12:30.880
你是在请我去干不法勾当的
You're asking me to break the law.

12:30.910 --> 12:32.490
我要你犯个小错误
I'm asking you to make a mistake.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.910
不伤害任何人 不偷任何东西 就...
Not hurt anyone, not steal anything.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.000
别锁门就行
Just forget to lock up.

12:39.210 --> 12:42.280
你今晚下班的时候 别把门锁上
Leave the door unlocked when you leave tonight.

12:42.420 --> 12:45.990
就这样 求你了
That's it. Please.

12:47.790 --> 12:51.070
这就是越狱的地方? 这个房间?
This is where you're breaking out of? This room?

12:52.560 --> 12:56.340
门周围的玻璃上装有报警器
There are alarm contacts on the glass surrounding the door.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.290
否则我就不会要你...
Otherwise, I wouldn't need you to...

12:58.430 --> 13:00.140
我一直都是你计划的一部分
I was part of your plan.

13:03.190 --> 13:04.620
你全是在演戏?
Was it all an act?

13:04.800 --> 13:07.100
开始的时候 是的
At first, yes.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.490
我得来这儿
I needed to be here.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.380
但后来我想要和你在一起
But then I wanted to be here with you.

13:15.660 --> 13:16.320
对
Right.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.800
知道你决不会相信这一切是一件很另人痛苦的事
And it's killing me to know that you'll never believe that.

13:20.240 --> 13:24.380
不管你对我怎么想 我都是为了林肯
Whatever you may think of me, this is about Lincoln.

13:26.110 --> 13:28.880
别因为我的错而让他受罪
Don't make him pay for my mistakes.

13:44.550 --> 13:45.250
耶?
Yeah?

13:45.670 --> 13:49.610
嘿 是我 看来要提前了
Hi, it's me. There's been an acceleration.

13:49.710 --> 13:51.250
提前到什么时候?
How fast are we talking about?

13:51.330 --> 13:53.950
-很快 就今晚  -狗娘养的
-Fast. Tonight.  -Son of a bitch.

13:54.090 --> 13:57.210
我想你应该没什么问题吧?
I think what you're trying to say is, "No problem"?

13:57.380 --> 13:59.430
是的 当然 我会搞定的
Yeah, of course. It'll be taken care of.

13:59.570 --> 14:01.330
好.车子呢?
Good. The van?

14:01.470 --> 14:03.200
在福驰街等着 200码...
Waiting up Fitz Street, 200 yards...

14:03.230 --> 14:07.100
-老厂后面?  -老厂后面 明白了
-Behind the old mill?  -Behind the old mill, I got it.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.660
有个问题 约翰 你不想来架大点的飞机吗?
One question, John. Don't you want a bigger plane?

14:12.760 --> 14:16.260
这飞机只有三个位置 我记得你说过有7 8个人
You only got three seats. I thought you said there were seven or eight guys.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.870
并不是每个人都能上飞机
Well, not everybody gonna have a ticket.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.430
能告诉我是哪几个吗?
You gonna tell me who is?

14:21.600 --> 14:23.320
那还活着的三个
The three of us still breathing.

14:25.070 --> 14:27.670
两张票 接近布莱克福特的任何一个机场都行
Whatever airport's closer to Blackfoot.

14:27.930 --> 14:31.860
是否靠窗等问题都不重要 给我们订下一班机的票子
Aisle, window, it doesn't matter, just get us on the next flight.

14:34.070 --> 14:35.570
好 我等着
Yeah, I'll hold.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.000
嘿?
Hello?

14:39.170 --> 14:40.600
计划改变了
Change of plans.

14:40.690 --> 14:43.940
今晚你就得把女孩带到机场跑道去
We're going to need you to have a girl at the airstrip tonight.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.280
-今晚?  -我说得不够清楚吗?
-Tonight?  -Was I not enunciating?

14:47.460 --> 14:49.510
不 只是 恩...
No, it's just that...

14:50.340 --> 14:52.480
事情可能会变糟糕
Look, things could get messy.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.860
穿上工作服吧
So wear a smock.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.030
彼得森和监狱长的秘书?
Is that his nympho secretary?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.890
你少来 伙计 好像你不会上似的
Come on, man, like you wouldn't hit that.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.450
我不知道 维加斯 凌晨2点 或许吧 但...
I don't know, Vegas, 2:00 a.m., maybe, but

15:24.540 --> 15:26.600
要不是她屁股那么大
if she didn't have such a big booty.

15:26.740 --> 15:30.290
女人的屁股是男人最大的弱点 我知道我会上的
Man, the booty is the man's biggest weakness. I know I would've hit it.

15:43.090 --> 15:45.050
可以去成医务室了?
You find a way to the infirmary yet?

15:45.660 --> 15:47.280
我还在想办法
I'm working on it.

16:16.870 --> 16:19.780
-嘿 你今天看到贝利克了?  -没看到
-Yo, you seen Bellick today?  -Not yet.

16:19.910 --> 16:22.710
我要跟他谈一谈 你知道他去哪了吗?
I need to talk to him. Do you know if he went somewheres?

16:22.720 --> 16:24.190
我看起来像他妈?
Do I look like his mother?

16:24.610 --> 16:26.180
这家伙我今天还没看到过
The guy hasn't shown up yet.

16:28.510 --> 16:29.960
你确定他今天没来?
You sure he ain't showed yet?

16:30.070 --> 16:32.520
因为我想我今天早上看到他了
'Cause I thought I saw him here this morning, man.

16:32.550 --> 16:35.180
特维纳 来这里帮我一把
Tweener! Need a hand over here.

16:35.330 --> 16:36.910
好 我来了
Yeah, I'm on it.

16:42.490 --> 16:45.000
-好了吧?  -好 
-All right?  -Fine.

16:45.090 --> 16:47.520
只是 恩... 有点痛 就这样
It's just sore, that's all.

16:48.230 --> 16:52.050
等你活到我的岁数 你就知道了
You live to my age, you'll know all about it.

17:15.100 --> 17:18.300
你知道你的母鸡屋里有几只狐狸 是吗? 
You know you got a couple of foxes in your hen house, right?

17:18.390 --> 17:19.990
你在说什么?
Who are we talking about?

17:20.100 --> 17:21.650
那两个天生的死对头
The bastard and the born again.

17:21.730 --> 17:24.270
他们俩都想离开这儿 那种时候不会闹事的
They both want out of here. They'll behave until then.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.190
你这么想?
Think so?

17:26.220 --> 17:28.890
我昨天从帝博格拿到这个
I just picked this off of T-Bag yesterday.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.900
如果我晚到10秒种
If I would've been there 10 seconds later,

17:30.930 --> 17:34.280
他们就得在太平间伺候那个浑身是血的阿布鲁奇了
they'd have been serving Abruzzi with red sauce over at the morgue.

17:34.370 --> 17:37.390
我知道你想尽量减少麻烦 这没问题
I know you want to be shot caller and everything, and that's cool,

17:37.420 --> 17:39.120
但你得解决这件事
but you got to handle things, man.

17:39.140 --> 17:41.370
听明白我说的话了吗?
Are you picking up what I'm putting down?

17:41.510 --> 17:42.190
是的
Yeah.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.970
事情就这样了 这次千万不能出任何差错了
Look, this is it, man. Ain't no do-overs this time.

17:45.090 --> 17:46.820
不能出现意外情况
Can't be no complications.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.900
今晚出不去 我们就再也别想出去了
We break out tonight, or we ain't never getting out.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.230
这是郡里拿来的书面材料
We got that paperwork in from the county.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.480
莎拉?
Sara?

18:07.560 --> 18:09.010
好. 抱歉
Yeah. Sorry.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.470
郡里拿来的书面材料
The paperwork from the county.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.630
好 知道了
Right. I got it.

18:12.860 --> 18:15.510
帮我个忙 能帮我看一下这个吗?
Do me a favor, could you take care of that for me?

18:15.540 --> 18:16.690
我得出去一趟
I got to get out of here.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.870
-行  -谢谢
-Sure.  -Thanks.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.860
-等等 你去哪?  -外面去
-Where are you going?  -Out.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.900
干完活后衣服不要脱
Put your blues on over your PI gear.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.560
-什么?  -照做就行了
-What?  -Just do it.

18:43.010 --> 18:44.440
能讲讲原因吗?
You want to tell us why?

18:44.530 --> 18:46.210
如果我们没时间拿到制服
If we don't have time to get the suits we need,

18:46.240 --> 18:47.590
我们就不得不用这个代替
we're gonna have to make them.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.870
你这是干什么 伙计? 有其它人在
Yo, what the hell are you doing, man? We got company.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.860
没事儿 他和我们一起走
It's okay. He's coming with us.

18:55.020 --> 18:57.860
你上次还说 "人太多了"?
Hey, whatever happened to, "We got too many people"?

18:58.020 --> 19:00.020
计划改变了 时间也就改变了
When the plan changed, so did the timing.

19:00.050 --> 19:01.680
我们要确保大家都出得去
I'll make sure we all get through.

19:01.710 --> 19:02.860
从健康的角度考虑
Well, for health reasons,

19:02.890 --> 19:05.720
这样的消息应该早点说
information like that should be disseminated a little more pronto.

19:05.760 --> 19:06.510
嫩鸡
Uh-uh, Fish.

19:06.690 --> 19:09.380
多个人就意味着 多一个环节会发生意外
One more person means there's one more thing that can go wrong.

19:09.410 --> 19:11.570
-他不准来  -这已经没有商量余地了
-He is not coming.  -It's not up for discussion.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.960
-怎么没有  -我欠他的
-The hell it ain't.  -I owe him.

19:14.340 --> 19:17.130
我可什么也不欠你
I don't owe you a damn thing.

19:19.780 --> 19:23.580
如果因为多了个人而使得我们被抓的话
Well, you're gonna if we get nailed 'cause you didn't wanna cut down on the damn guest list.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.560
别担忧 没事的
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.410
等等
Hold up, cons.

19:48.180 --> 19:51.480
那里面的地板上我看到有几滴血
I saw some drops of blood on the floor of the PI locker room.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.860
谁告诉我这是怎么回事儿?
Now who's going to tell me what's going on?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.340
应该是我 头儿
That'd be me, boss.

20:11.270 --> 20:16.580
我 我卸载东西的时候割破了手
I did it while I was loading some equipment back into the shed.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.100
记住去包扎一下
You make sure and get that patched up.

20:20.310 --> 20:21.190
我会的
Will do.

20:22.740 --> 20:23.730
好
Okay.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.320
走吧
Move it!

20:32.700 --> 20:34.220
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

20:34.830 --> 20:38.900
足以撑到外面 我保证
Okay enough to make it out of here tonight, I swear.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.960
雪丽 是 是我
Hey, Shelly, this is... It's me.

21:12.130 --> 21:15.780
听着 我知道一旦我发生什么事... 应该打电话给你...
Listen, I know I'm supposed to call you as my sponsor, in case I have a...

22:07.060 --> 22:08.130
好
Right.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.490
我觉得我们应该开瓶香槟庆祝一下
I think we should break a bottle of champagne across its bow.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.670
如果你打算今晚把这个带回家庆祝
If you're intending to get this thing home for your anniversary tonight,

22:13.670 --> 22:15.820
我不建议你这么做
I wouldn't recommend it.

22:15.850 --> 22:16.360
不是的
No.

22:18.610 --> 22:20.800
听着 你要知道我...
Listen, I want you to know that I...

22:21.690 --> 22:24.870
能遇到你真的很幸运
Well, I feel very fortunate to have met you.

22:24.990 --> 22:29.090
是啊 很少会有建筑师来狐狸河
Yeah. I'm guessing not many structural engineers make their way into Fox River.

22:29.190 --> 22:31.060
不 不 我那么说不是因为你的职业
No, no, I don't mean because of your vocation.

22:31.090 --> 22:32.660
而是因为你是个很不错的年轻小伙
I mean because you're a decent young man,

22:32.690 --> 22:35.010
而很少会有那样的人来到狐狸河
and there are not many of those who make their way into Fox River.

22:35.040 --> 22:38.340
我这么说吧 其实还是有一些的
Well, for what it's worth, there are a few down there.

22:38.860 --> 22:40.710
这倒挺不错
Well, that's good to hear.

22:41.900 --> 22:44.860
听着 我知道这其实没必要说出来 但...
Listen, I know this goes without saying, but

22:45.660 --> 22:47.590
如果你需要什么...
if there's anything you need...

22:48.130 --> 22:51.110
这么说吧 我欠你一个人情
Well, let's just say that I owe you one.

22:51.770 --> 22:56.910
事实上... 我确实有件事想要你帮忙
Actually, there is one thing you can do for me.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.780
所以说这整件事其实并不是围绕我的
So this whole thing, this whole time, it was never about me.

23:01.950 --> 23:03.570
而是和爸爸有关
It was about Dad.

23:04.370 --> 23:06.030
我不能相信...
I can't believe it.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.120
迈克尔? 迈克尔!
Michael. Michael!

23:10.270 --> 23:10.840
什么?
What?

23:10.950 --> 23:12.770
你没什么想告诉我的?
You got something you want to tell me?

23:12.800 --> 23:16.600
我刚告诉你所有关于爸爸的一切其实是个谎言 而你眼睛都没眨一下
Just told you everything we knew about Dad was a lie,and you barely blinked.

23:18.650 --> 23:20.830
我们得走了 今晚
We have to go. Tonight.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.470
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

23:23.240 --> 23:27.220
贝利克发现那个洞了 要么现在就走 要么永远走不了了
Bellick found the hole, so either we go now or it's over.

23:28.050 --> 23:28.950
迈克尔...
Michael.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.080
听着 我知道时间很紧 但我做得到
Look, I know it's gonna be tight, but I can do this.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.220
迈克尔 别说了
Michael, stop it.

23:32.380 --> 23:34.380
这锁链 它们是 恩...
The chains on your locks, they're...

23:34.460 --> 23:36.200
迈克尔! 迈克尔!
Michael! Michael!

23:36.350 --> 23:37.960
-我能做到!  -听我说!
-I can do this!  -Listen to me!

23:39.130 --> 23:42.990
-走吧 你得走了  -别那么说
-Go. You gotta go.  -Don't say that.

23:43.420 --> 23:44.860
你看看我!
Look at me!

23:44.990 --> 23:47.430
你做不到的 时间不允许了
You can't do this. There's not enough time.

23:47.790 --> 23:50.850
如果你呆在这儿 他们一定会抓住你 你就死定了
If you stay here, they'll nail you and you'll rot in here.

23:51.350 --> 23:53.970
我不是在请求 我是在告诉你
I'm not asking you, man, I'm telling you.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.680
不要管我了
Leave me behind.

24:00.530 --> 24:01.720
走吧
Go.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.870
你他妈的在干什么?
What the hell you think you doing?

24:32.520 --> 24:33.770
没什么 伙计
Nothing, man.

24:33.950 --> 24:37.300
你想在我们亲爱的食物里面做手脚吗?
You trying to run something for those Wonder Breads you been running around with?

24:37.330 --> 24:38.660
不 不是这样
No, it ain't even like that.

24:38.690 --> 24:39.900
那你告诉我 小子
Tell me something, boy.

24:40.030 --> 24:43.060
你在耍诡计还是玩阴谋?
Is you stepping or is you fetching?

24:43.390 --> 24:47.380
我想我已经说得够明白了 你这蠢蛋不准再踏入我们的领地
I thought I made myself clear when I said your punk ass was no longer in business.

24:47.410 --> 24:50.150
这不是你们的领地 好吧? 这是我私人的事情
This ain't business, all right? This is personal.

24:50.220 --> 24:52.620
你在拿什么东西? 洗涤液?
What you got there anyway, some kind of cleaner?

24:52.840 --> 24:55.000
你想洗什么...
What you trying to clean up,

24:55.680 --> 24:57.730
富兰克林中士?
Sergeant Franklin?

25:27.560 --> 25:31.230
前方记者南茜会作详细报导 南茜?
Nancy Lu has the details. Nancy.

25:31.390 --> 25:33.890
副总统雷诺兹 竞选阵营中传出流言
And rumors coming out of Vice President Reynolds' camp

25:33.980 --> 25:37.960
竞选伙伴的最初名单出了问题
detail a preliminary short list of running mates

25:38.040 --> 25:40.190
她能够众望所归地得到任命吗?
should she, as expected, win her party's nomination.

25:40.350 --> 25:44.780
也许最令人惊讶的是伊利诺斯州州长 弗兰克·唐克雷蒂卷入了此事
Perhaps the biggest surprise is the inclusion of llinois governor Frank Tancredi.

25:44.870 --> 25:48.890
考虑到这可以归因于他在对待犯罪上一贯强硬的立场
His consideration is attributed to his reputation for being tough on crime.

25:48.970 --> 25:53.490
尤其是近来在对待林肯·布伦斯这个案子上毫不手软
And some point to his recent refusal to grant clemency to Lincoln Burrows,

25:53.640 --> 25:55.970
林肯·布伦斯是杀害副总统弟弟的凶手
the murderer of the Vice President's brother,

25:56.070 --> 26:00.400
因此得到了白宫的一致赞赏和认同
which was welcomed with deep appreciation from within the Oval Office.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.390
你他妈在干什么 约翰?
What the hell are you doing, John?

26:57.480 --> 26:58.980
上帝的工作
Lord's work.

26:59.120 --> 27:02.030
上帝要你把马粪撒在你的床垫上?
The Lord wants you to spread horse crap all over your mattress?

27:02.060 --> 27:04.900
我们没权力质疑他的意愿
It's not in our place to question his will.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.980
明白了吗?
Are we clear?

27:12.690 --> 27:14.560
安静点
Hey, hey, hey! Let's cut the noise.

27:29.810 --> 27:31.840
打开88号!
Open on 88!

27:37.130 --> 27:39.790
-怎么了?  -艾拂卡托的东西
-Yo, what's that?  -Avocado's gear.

27:40.060 --> 27:42.420
他今晚就可以回来了
He's getting out of the infirmary tonight.

27:42.570 --> 27:43.620
今晚?
Tonight?

27:43.750 --> 27:47.420
所以你有足够时间给他庆祝一下了
So you got plenty of time to bake him a cake.

27:48.340 --> 27:51.700
我听说你在问彼得森关于贝利克的事
Hey, I heard you were asking Patterson about Bellick.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.640
说好像你今天早上看到他了?
Said you thought you saw him this morning?

27:57.670 --> 28:00.370
是的 我看到了
Yeah. I was.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.540
不 应该是昨天 应该是昨天看到他的
No, it was yesterday. That's when I saw him.

28:11.710 --> 28:15.800
-你确定?  -确定
-You sure?  -Yeah.

28:16.350 --> 28:19.500
你知道 有时候在这儿搞不清楚时间
You know, time just sort of blends together up in here.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.480
好吧
All right.

28:24.890 --> 28:26.690
88号关上!
Close on 88!

28:33.690 --> 28:35.820
我用这个干什么?
What am I supposed to do with this?

28:35.920 --> 28:37.260
把它倒在马桶里
Pour it in the toilet.

28:37.420 --> 28:40.320
你叫他从厨房偷洗涤液是为了洗马桶?
so we can clean the toilet?

28:40.350 --> 28:43.540
我们今晚都得穿过精神病区到达管道那边
We got to get all of us in the psych ward tonight to access the pipes.

28:43.570 --> 28:47.530
有一大帮穿蓝制服的狱警会在那边看守
A bunch of cons wearing their prison blues would stick out like a sore thumb.

28:47.650 --> 28:50.520
但精神病区的囚犯都穿着...
But the inmates in the psych ward all wear...

28:50.610 --> 28:51.420
白色
White.

28:51.500 --> 28:55.070
-洗涤液起漂白作用  -伪装起来
-Peroxide acts as a bleach.  -Camouflage.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.460
只有没几个小时了
Just a few more hours now.

29:03.550 --> 29:05.500
看来该弄的都弄到了...
Looks like we got everything we need.

29:06.050 --> 29:07.900
除了还有你哥哥
Everything except your brother.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.440
你操心衣服的事就行了
You worry about the suits.

29:12.090 --> 29:14.520
林肯的事由我来操心
I'll worry about Linc.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.610
你能给我们几分钟时间吗?
Could you give us a couple of minutes?

29:17.640 --> 29:20.650
-当然可以 总统先生  -你可能知道我此行的目的
-Of course, Mr. President.  -You probably know why I'm here.

29:20.810 --> 29:24.020
如果我是个赌徒 我有个很好的主意该把筹码放哪儿
Lf I were a betting man, I have a pretty good idea where I'd lay my chips.

29:24.050 --> 29:27.420
那能源议案 理查德 你怎么改变主意了?
The energy bill, Richard. Why did you change your mind?

29:27.580 --> 29:29.730
你一直在说这太耗资金了
You've been saying for months it's so full of pork,

29:29.760 --> 29:32.790
这东西还是放弃算了 可突然你却...
the damn thing's ready to squeal, and now all of a...

29:32.960 --> 29:35.230
是的 那议案确实有缺陷 但总比什么都不做要好
Yes, the bill is flawed, but it's better than doing nothing.

29:35.260 --> 29:38.600
坦白说 现在怎么轮到你站在这儿
And, frankly, I find it a little curious that you're here,

29:38.670 --> 29:41.180
告诉我去否决这项议案 而你一直都是赞同这议案的
telling me to veto a bill you voted in favor of.

29:41.330 --> 29:43.210
你正在摆脱困境
You're on the way out.

29:43.530 --> 29:46.000
有些人想问题必须要有前瞻性
Some of us need to think ahead.

29:46.110 --> 29:49.420
事实上 我也考虑了很多其它问题卡罗琳 
Actually, I've been doing some thinking ahead as well, Caroline,

29:49.500 --> 29:51.410
具体讲 关于我的"批准"问题
specifically, about my endorsement.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.420
什么?!
What?

29:52.670 --> 29:54.880
我在考虑是否要改变一下
I'm considering making a switch,

29:54.990 --> 29:57.340
让参议员查理斯给我分担一些
throwing my weight behind Senator Challis.

29:58.170 --> 30:00.760
-你不能那么做  -不能?
-You can't do that.  -Can't I?

30:01.640 --> 30:05.900
卡罗琳 你的政治完全搞反了
Caroline, you are everything that's wrong with politics.

30:06.050 --> 30:09.000
你投票不是要修改立法 而是要从中获利
You vote not to legislate change, but to profit.

30:09.260 --> 30:13.260
你竞选不是要改变现状 而是要提出更多要求
You run not to make a difference, but to make demands.

30:13.930 --> 30:18.400
你把我拉拢不是因为我能帮你提意见
You put me on your ticket not because I share your views,

30:18.480 --> 30:21.260
而是因为我是个女性
but because I didn't share your gender.

30:21.370 --> 30:25.860
所以不要显得很高尚 我们都知道游戏是怎么玩的
So don't take the moral high ground. We all know how this game is played.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.040
-理查德 求你 我...  -保重 卡罗琳
-Richard, please, I...  -Good day, Caroline.

30:29.180 --> 30:30.780
理查德! 理查德!
Richard! Richard!

30:34.250 --> 30:36.650
你知道周年纪念的时候我给我老婆买了什么吗?
You know what I got my wife for our anniversary?

30:36.820 --> 30:38.040
-什么?  -一条围巾
-What?  -A scarf.

30:38.620 --> 30:41.720
这是个大周年纪念 所以我必须搞得特殊一点
Well, this is a big one for me. I had to do something special.

30:41.990 --> 30:44.590
好 让我们把这扛到车上去
Okay, let's get this thing down to the car.

30:44.710 --> 30:47.420
我们三个人一块儿搬
We'll do it all together on three.

30:47.510 --> 30:50.720
准备? 1... 2... 3
Ready? One. Two. Three.

30:50.820 --> 30:51.730
起...


30:51.910 --> 30:56.500
不! 放下来 放下 放下
Oh, no! Oh, no! Put it down, put it down, put it down.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.470
马上把斯科菲尔德叫过来
All right, get Scofield up here right away!

31:01.820 --> 31:03.410
起作用了
It's working.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.400
好 把他们晾干吧
All right, get them out and get them dry.

31:06.430 --> 31:08.760
列队的时候我们得把这衣服穿里面
We got to get them on under our clothes before tier time,

31:08.790 --> 31:10.810
大概还有... 45分钟时间
which is in 45 minutes.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.520
你觉得其他人都已经准备好了吗?
You think everyone else will be ready?

31:12.550 --> 31:13.520
我们没得选了
We don't have a choice.

31:13.550 --> 31:14.840
门一开 我们就行动
As soon as the gate's open, we go.

31:14.870 --> 31:16.520
我们得分秒必争
And we're gonna need every second.

31:16.590 --> 31:18.190
打开40号门
Open on 40.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.400
斯科菲尔德 监狱长要见你 马上
Scofield, Pope needs to see you, ASAP.

31:23.580 --> 31:25.050
-现在?  -干什么?
-Now?  -What for?

31:25.140 --> 31:27.110
泰姬陵 走吧
A bar mitzvah. Let's go.

31:27.230 --> 31:28.630
已经6:18 老兄 你不能...
It's 6:15, bro. You can't...

31:28.710 --> 31:29.890
现在!
Now!

31:45.650 --> 31:48.330
美人儿 嘀嘀哒哒
Hey, pretty, tick-tock.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.910
给我一分钟
Excuse me a minute.

32:50.210 --> 32:53.050
莎拉 是什么风把你吹来了?
Sara, to what do I owe the pleasure?

32:53.230 --> 32:54.950
我想我是来庆贺的吧
I guess to congratulations.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.250
不敢相信我是从新闻上听到的
Can't believe I had to hear about it on the news.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.200
那副总统的事 那只是说说而已的
Oh, the VP thing. Well, that's just talk.

32:59.230 --> 32:59.850
是吗?
Is it?

32:59.990 --> 33:01.610
是的 你妈妈曾怎么说?
Yeah. What was it your mother used to say?

33:01.640 --> 33:03.470
能被邀请跳舞总是件好事
"It's always nice to be invited to the dance,

33:03.500 --> 33:05.500
即使你没有穿对鞋子
even if you don't have the right shoes."

33:05.580 --> 33:08.000
是的 她也常说"你是你爸爸撒谎的借口"?
Yeah. She also used to say, "Your father's a lying bastard,"

33:08.030 --> 33:10.330
但我总把它当成是酒话
but I figured that was just the booze talking.

33:11.140 --> 33:13.060
知道吗 看见你总能让我很开心
You know, it's always nice to see you, Sara.

33:13.090 --> 33:15.540
你是需要什么 还是顺道看看 
Is there something that you needed? Or did you just come by to...

33:15.570 --> 33:16.720
你只需告诉我
Just tell me something.

33:16.880 --> 33:20.150
我给你的林肯·布伦斯的材料你看过了吗?
Did you look at the information I gave you from Lincoln Burrows' attorneys?

33:20.180 --> 33:21.380
宝贝儿 别管那事了
Sweetheart, move on.

33:21.460 --> 33:24.360
他的律师本有机会呈上新证据
The man's attorneys had a window to present new evidence,

33:24.430 --> 33:26.450
可他们没有 现在没这个机会了
they didn't. Now that window is closed.

33:26.530 --> 33:28.920
我只想知道你有没有看过那些材料?
I just need to know, did you look at the information?

33:28.950 --> 33:30.790
-别这样 莎拉  -回答我
-Come on, Sara.  -Answer me.

33:31.530 --> 33:34.000
我敢保证  在狐狸河工作改变了你许多
I swear, working at Fox River has changed you.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.090
你总是说你想改变现状?
You're always saying you want to make a difference?

33:36.120 --> 33:38.290
在那个地方? 太迟了
At that place? It's too late.

33:38.370 --> 33:41.700
你应该做一个老师 教导他们 防止他们走犯罪之路...
You should be a teacher, so that you can get to these people before they become...

33:41.730 --> 33:43.380
你看过材料了吗?
Did you look at the information?

33:43.560 --> 33:45.030
我没这个必要去看
I didn't need to.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.900
我支持法庭的材料
I supported the findings of the court.

33:48.630 --> 33:51.710
如果你对裁决有异议 那找他们去
If you have a problem with the verdict, go after them.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.540
但在你去之前 我建议你看看这个家伙的犯罪纪录
But before you do, I suggest you look at the guy's rap sheet

33:54.570 --> 33:57.170
你问问你自己 这世界如果多了个林肯·布伦斯
and ask yourself if the world will be a better place

33:57.220 --> 33:58.990
会变得更美好么
with Lincoln Burrows walking the streets.

33:59.020 --> 34:01.360
告诉我 他们是在你签署死刑令之前还是之后
Just tell me one thing. Did they promise you the vice presidency

34:01.390 --> 34:03.990
向你保证副总统这个职位的?
before or after you signed his death warrant?

34:04.170 --> 34:06.990
我不会与一个瘾君子或者小偷谈论道德
I will not discuss morality with an addict and a thief.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.590
你想谈论现实 莎拉?
You want to talk reality, Sara?

34:08.620 --> 34:11.070
我有多少次利用我的权力
How many times did I use my influence to keep you

34:11.090 --> 34:13.210
保释过你和你的那些男朋友?
and one of your junkie boyfriends out of jail?

34:13.240 --> 34:15.150
多少次? 3次 4次?
How many? Was it three, four times?

34:15.230 --> 34:17.350
莎拉 这很可笑 你知道吗?
I swear, Sara, it's funny, you know?

34:17.550 --> 34:20.400
当我为了你逾越法律的时候...
You have no trouble whatsoever with me bending the law,

34:20.830 --> 34:23.780
你从不会觉得怎么样
especially when it's bent in your direction.

34:24.530 --> 34:25.670
该长大了
Grow up.

34:32.510 --> 34:34.060
你和那个孩子谈过了?
You talk to that Tweener kid?

34:34.100 --> 34:36.950
是的 他说他把日子搞混了 我也不清楚
Yeah, he says he got his days mixed up, but I don't know.

34:36.950 --> 34:37.510
什么?
What?

34:37.640 --> 34:39.390
他说话的方式有点怪
Just something about the way he said it.

34:39.490 --> 34:41.730
算了吧 伙计 贝利克只是针对他而已
Oh, come on, man, Bellick's just taking a personal.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.110
我不想让这小子惹麻烦
I don't want to get the guy busted.

34:43.140 --> 34:44.290
如果他不是呢?
And if he's not?

34:44.370 --> 34:47.950
我是说 都已经6点半了 却还没人听到有他的消息
I'm just saying, it's 6:30, and no one's heard from the guy.

34:48.510 --> 34:53.810
-我们得告诉监狱长  -好吧 我去告诉他
-We got to tell Pope.  -Okay. I'll tell him.

34:58.140 --> 35:00.250
你叫了去机场的的士了吗?
Did you call a cab for the airport?

35:00.370 --> 35:01.280
没 还没有
No, not yet.

35:01.450 --> 35:03.430
为什么还没有? 快 飞机一小时后就起飞了
Why not? Come on, the flight leaves in an hour.

35:03.460 --> 35:04.030
是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

35:05.900 --> 35:09.680
我在想 也许去蒙大纳并不是个好主意
I'm starting to think that us going to Montana might not be a good move.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.110
你说什么呀?
What are you talking about?

35:11.280 --> 35:14.280
万一你说得没错 那枪都还在屋子里头
What if you are right and the smoking gun is in that house?

35:14.430 --> 35:17.100
你以为他们会让我进去? 你以为他们会缴械自降?
You think they're just gonna let us walk in there and make a citizen's arrest?

35:17.130 --> 35:18.860
听着 尼克 我不知道你最近怎么回事
Look, Nick, I don't know what your deal is lately,

35:18.890 --> 35:21.720
但我无论如何都得上飞机 不管你去还是不去
but I'm getting on that plane with or without you.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.600
我不能让你这么做
I can't let you do that.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.950
原来你一直都和他们是一伙的?
All this time you were one of them?

35:42.570 --> 35:46.460
谁给你下的命令 尼克? 斯蒂德曼? 凯勒曼?
Who's pulling your leash, Nick? Steadman? Kellerman?

35:47.320 --> 35:49.940
看着我 我要你记住我这张脸
Look at me. I want you to remember my face

35:50.130 --> 35:52.730
不管你即将怎么做
when you do whatever the hell it is you're gonna do.

35:53.340 --> 35:55.020
看着我!
Look at me!

35:56.760 --> 35:58.280
你是个懦夫
You're a coward.

36:08.690 --> 36:11.730
-斯科菲尔德在外面等着 先生  -好
-Scofield's outside, sir.  -Okay.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.690
我要你拨打和布拉德·贝利克有关的所有电话
I want you to try every number we have for Brad Bellick.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.730
先打他家 他妈妈通常会接电话
Try his home first. His mother usually answers.

36:23.770 --> 36:25.420
贝利克夫人? 你好
Mrs. Bellick? Hi.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.400
请等一等 狱长有话跟您讲
One moment, please. I have Warden Pope here for you.

36:28.870 --> 36:31.760
贝利克夫人? 没什么要紧事 没 没有
Mrs. Bellick?No cause for alarm, no, no.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.640
我们只是... 我们今天还没见过他
We just...We haven't seen him,

36:33.730 --> 36:36.730
我们在想 他是否在家没来
and we were wondering if he might be home under the weather.

36:42.420 --> 36:45.370
这么说他今天到这的时候打过电话给你?
So Brad called you when he pulled in this morning?

36:45.730 --> 36:47.740
他说他在这儿?
And he said he was here?

36:47.900 --> 36:49.980
好 谢谢 贝利克夫人
Okay, well, thank you, Mrs. Bellick.

36:50.020 --> 36:52.220
我们会再和你联系的 我相信他没事儿
We'll keep you posted. I'm sure he's fine.

36:53.390 --> 36:56.620
通知麦柯 叫他检查一下车库 看有没贝利克的车
Radio Mack. Have him check the parking lot for Bellick's truck.

36:56.810 --> 36:59.420
如果找到了 马上叫他打电话通知我
If he finds it, have him call me immediately.

37:04.050 --> 37:07.580
457 这是总部 你那情况怎样?
457 This is base. What's your 20?

37:15.900 --> 37:17.290
我怀孕了 费尔南多
I'm pregnant, Fernando.

37:17.460 --> 37:18.880
我有你的孩子了
I'm gonna have your son.

37:19.060 --> 37:21.490
但我只知道 我真的很害怕
But all I know is, is I'm really scared.

37:22.150 --> 37:24.770
我害怕就这么孤单一个人
I'm really scared to do this alone.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.310
约翰 从来都不会太迟
John, it's never too late.

37:33.410 --> 37:37.210
如果你诚心想接受上帝的召唤并向他赎罪
If you'll agree to accept Christ into your heart and turn from your sin,

37:37.390 --> 37:41.410
他会宽恕你 并解救你至永生
he will forgive you and save you in eternity.

37:42.230 --> 37:44.740
时间合适 我就会给你菲波纳奇
I'll give you Fibonacci when the time is right.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.170
现在正是时候
The time is right now.

37:46.350 --> 37:50.100
不 当你我都站在高墙外面的时候 时间才会合适
No, the time is right when you and I are both standing outside those walls.

38:05.770 --> 38:09.390
我总有一天会出去的 到时候...
I'm gonna get out of here someday, and when I do,

38:10.760 --> 38:16.020
...别指望我不记得你家门口的样子
don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like.

38:28.510 --> 38:32.060
我... 又要回到那边去了
I'm being shipped back off.

38:48.890 --> 38:51.160
我得说多少次?
How many times I got to say it?

38:51.350 --> 38:53.410
你只有一样我要的东西
You only got one thing I need.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.820
我有个坏消息 查尔斯
I've got some bad news, Charles.

39:19.100 --> 39:21.530
你女儿得了食道癌
Your daughter's got esophageal cancer,

39:21.620 --> 39:24.780
趁现在还有时间 她想见见你
and she wants to see you while there's still time.

39:25.270 --> 39:29.250
-她还能活多久?  -医院说一周
-How long does she have?  -Hospital says a week.

41:22.430 --> 41:26.350
我在哪里看到说 真正的泰姬陵在早上会呈现出粉红色
I read somewhere where the actual Taj Mahal appears pink in the morning,

41:26.450 --> 41:30.560
傍晚会呈现出乳白色 而当月亮升起的时候就成了金黄色
milky white in the evening and golden when the moon shines.

41:30.660 --> 41:34.810
这种变化 他们说 相当于女子的各种不同的情绪
The changes, they say, depict the different emotions of a woman.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.110
我可以告诉你 如果今天晚上不把这个修好
Well, I can tell you something, if we don't get this thing fixed tonight,

41:37.140 --> 41:39.110
我可不想知道我老婆会有怎样的情绪
I don't wanna know what kind of emotion my wife is gonna have

41:39.140 --> 41:41.240
如果我空手走进那算门
if I walk through that door empty-handed.

41:41.340 --> 41:43.070
真奇怪 我是说 就这么倒了
It's strange. I mean, it just gave way.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.400
我们刚把它抬起来 支撑的悬梁就断了
We lifted it up, and the support beam snapped.

41:48.060 --> 41:50.450
-这是什么?  -支架
-What's this?  -The support.

41:51.830 --> 41:54.240
用来支撑悬梁的
And the one that holds up that beam.

41:54.650 --> 41:56.170
你把它拿走了?
You took it?

41:58.460 --> 42:00.200
很抱歉...
I'm sorry.

42:00.990 --> 42:03.570
我需要再来到这里
But I needed to get back in here.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.090
我不明白 你为什么...
I don't understand. Why would you...

42:06.570 --> 42:08.540
我要出去
I'm breaking out.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.400
你得确保我哥哥和我一起走
And you're gonna make sure my brother goes with me.
