00:02.700 --> 00:03.510
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

00:03.540 --> 00:05.590
尽力回忆那些蓝图
I'm trying to remember those blueprints,

00:05.640 --> 00:07.020
被烫伤丢失的部分
what we lost to the burn.

00:07.170 --> 00:11.010
没有那部分 我们将永远无法穿越精神病区下面的管道
Without them, we'll never be able to navigate those pipes beneath psych ward.

00:11.820 --> 00:14.920
但我必须搞清楚 你是在哪里被烧伤的
Then I need to know where you got that burn. Right now.

00:15.010 --> 00:17.490
否则 就等着关禁闭吧
Otherwise, your ass is going to solitary.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.290
我倾注了所有心血
I put my blood into this...

00:19.900 --> 00:21.290
能否详细解释一下?
How about you elaborate on that?

00:21.320 --> 00:23.150
能否不要再问这些问题?
How about you stop with all the questions?

00:23.180 --> 00:26.560
你的工作是保镖 仅此而已
You are a glorified bodyguard, that's it.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.410
好 我拿到了
Okay, I got it.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.310
把枪放下 你不是个杀人犯
Put it down. You're not a killer.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.130
让开
Get out of the way.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.990
要知道 他们给你这些药物是有原因的
You know, maybe they give you those things for a reason.

00:38.020 --> 00:41.220
是啊 以一种无形的方式把我束缚
Yeah. To keep me in their invisible freaking handcuffs.

00:41.310 --> 00:44.460
你好 室友 你说得没错
Hello, roomie. You were right about my tattoo.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.020
确实是通道
It is a path...

00:46.120 --> 00:49.460
我要你回忆你看到它时候的样子
And I need you to remember when you saw it, Haywire.

00:49.740 --> 00:51.020
你是谁?
Who are you?

00:53.450 --> 00:57.030

00:57.880 --> 00:59.870
毫无印象
Doesn't ring a bell.

我们先前在普通监区40号牢房见过的
We met a while ago in Gen pop. Cell 40.

01:04.250 --> 01:07.020
-什么是区?  -普通监区
-Gen pop?  -General population.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.920
贝利克警官安排你和我住一个房间
Officer Bellick assigned you to my cell.

01:11.650 --> 01:15.090
我有纹身 你把它画下来了
I have a tattoo, you drew it.

01:16.350 --> 01:21.700
海威尔 你对我一点印象都没了?
Haywire, do I look even vaguely familiar to you?

01:30.280 --> 01:33.710
你是那个偷我牙膏的家伙?
Are you the guy who stole my toothpaste?

01:33.990 --> 01:38.340
是的 是的 我偷了你的牙膏
Yes, yes. I stole your toothpaste.

01:38.470 --> 01:40.190
这么说你记起来了
So you do remember.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.850
吃糖了
Candy man.

01:42.410 --> 01:43.640
帕托塞克先生
Mr. Patoshik.

01:48.270 --> 01:51.600
-斯科菲尔德先生  -不用了 谢谢
-Mr. Scofield.  -No, thank you.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.030
服药是强制性的
Medication is mandatory.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.930
只是一种很温和的镇定剂 唐克雷蒂医生开的 来吧
It's just a mild sedative prescribed by Dr. Tancredi. Come on.

01:58.030 --> 02:01.030
那我就直接跟她谈 我现在感觉好多了
Then I'll talk to her directly. I'm feeling better.

02:01.150 --> 02:03.440
哦 真的吗? 很好 好 现在吃药
Oh, really? That's great. Now take the pill.

02:03.670 --> 02:06.440
吃吧 味道还不错的
Take them. They're good.

02:07.190 --> 02:09.190
我不要 谢谢
I'm fine. Thank you.

02:09.890 --> 02:12.650
卡特 你能过来一下吗?!
Carter, could you come here a sec?

02:13.540 --> 02:15.110
斯科菲尔德被送到精神病区了?
Scofield went J-Cat?

02:15.200 --> 02:16.920
当然 我也看到了
Sure did. I saw it coming, too.

02:17.060 --> 02:19.260
我第一眼看见他的时候就知道 他会精神崩溃的
I knew he was gonna crack first time I saw him.

02:19.290 --> 02:20.960
就是说他不会再回这儿了
So he's not coming back here?

02:21.050 --> 02:23.150
我比较怀疑 他们都已经把他单独禁闭了
Doubt it. They had him in the whack shack.

02:23.290 --> 02:25.960
-苏克雷怎么说?  -他也被关单独禁闭 怎么了?
-What about Sucre?  -He's in ad seg. Why?

02:26.050 --> 02:29.680
房间居中 楼层居中 属于上等牢房
Middle cell, middle tier, prime piece of real estate.

02:29.810 --> 02:31.670
知道我在想什么吗?
You thinking what I'm thinking?

02:31.950 --> 02:32.900
或许
Maybe.

02:32.990 --> 02:37.580
我们可以把它作为暂住单间拍卖掉
We promise to keep it a single for a couple of months, auction it off.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.310
那就做吧
Make it happen.

02:44.910 --> 02:46.870
我不需要药物
I don't need medication.

02:46.960 --> 02:51.640
吞下去 否则从你的"后门"塞进去
Swallow it, or it's going in the rear door.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.650
全吞下去了?
All gone?

03:01.630 --> 03:02.770
不错
Nice.

03:21.560 --> 03:25.090
你说得很对 海威尔 我确实偷了你的牙膏
You were right, Haywire. I did steal your toothpaste,

03:25.230 --> 03:30.130
你曾凭借记忆临摹了我的纹身 我要你再画一次
and you drew that tattoo from memory, and I need you to do it again.

03:38.620 --> 03:42.050
居中的房间 冬暖夏凉
Middle cell, cool in the summer, warm in the winter.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.640
-你出价多少?  -你有多少?
-How much you asking?  -How much you got?

03:47.060 --> 03:50.210
200块 成交吗?
$200. We got a deal?

03:50.350 --> 03:51.200
成交
Deal.

03:51.340 --> 03:54.240
好 你现在可以出去了 我给你办转移手续
Now get your ass out of here and I'll put in the transfer.

嘿 伙计 马桶漏水的

04:02.940 --> 04:04.310

我会叫人来修的 24小时内换新
I'll put in a work order. It'll be replaced in 24 hours.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.220
说好了 头儿

Already been moved.

04:17.130 --> 04:20.180
-斯科菲尔德的牢房?  -不再是他的了
-Ain't that Scofield's cell?  -Not anymore.

04:20.650 --> 04:22.500
40号关上!
Close on 40!

05:02.700 --> 05:03.890
这是你女儿?
Is that your daughter?

05:05.630 --> 05:09.010
她出生的时候 我老婆给了我这照片
My wife gave me this when she was born.

05:13.930 --> 05:16.830
失去老婆的生活已经够糟糕了
Outliving your wife is bad enough.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.780
失去女儿 
Outliving your daughter...

05:20.290 --> 05:23.250
不应该有人去遭受这种折磨
No man should have to endure that.

05:26.530 --> 05:28.390
她还能活多久?
How long does she have?

05:28.530 --> 05:32.290
医院说是一周 顶不过两周
Hospital says a week, maybe two.

05:34.870 --> 05:36.300
出问题了
We got us a problem.

05:37.520 --> 05:41.570
"麻鸡"要搬到斯科菲尔德的房里去了 这还没完
Mojo's moving into Scofield's cell, and that ain't all.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.920
他还抱怨马桶漏水 所以加里下了维修通知单
He's bitching about the toilet, so Geary's putting in a work order.

05:44.950 --> 05:47.360
-一旦移动马桶...  -就会发现那个洞
-They move that toilet...  -They find the hole.

05:47.450 --> 05:50.460
-我们就全完了  -麻鸡出价多少?
-We are all screwed.  -How much Mojo promise?

05:50.550 --> 05:51.160
200块
$200.

05:51.540 --> 05:55.260
呵 傻子 差点被你吓着了
Oh, Gomer, now you see, you had me scared there for a second.

06:00.980 --> 06:04.320
-听说你有个新牢房  -已经没有了
-I hear you got a cell.  -Not anymore.

06:04.450 --> 06:07.510
如果你够聪明的话 最好不要说出去
And if you were smart, you'd keep quiet about that.

06:07.630 --> 06:09.590
嘿 听着 我付你双倍的钱
Hey, look, I'll double what you're getting.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.950
他付了我$250
I'm getting $250.

06:11.090 --> 06:13.140
$500? 没问题
$500? Ain't a problem.

06:13.260 --> 06:16.320
我不是在这说香烟或者点心什么的
I ain't talking cigarettes and extra chow line desserts here.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.610
我要的是印有那些白鬼头像的绿颜色大钞票
I'm talking green paper with dead white guys on it.

06:19.740 --> 06:21.980
我说了 不成问题
I said it ain't a problem.

06:38.810 --> 06:39.750
走
Come on.

06:40.780 --> 06:43.740
-去哪?  -给你个惊喜
-Where?  -It's a surprise.

06:58.690 --> 07:00.450
我没穿纸尿布
I don't wear a diaper.

07:00.590 --> 07:02.250
我从没说过你穿了
I never said you did.

07:02.810 --> 07:04.480
那你想干什么?
Then what are you doing?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.320
你牙齿里有东西
You got something in your teeth.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.130
-什么?  -哦 好 就在那儿
-What?  -Oh, yeah. Right there.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.610
就在背面
It's right there in the back.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.130
来吧
Come on.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.440
你干吗这么做?
Why are you doing this?

07:22.580 --> 07:24.340
我是在帮你
I am helping you.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.100
记得你曾把这些药片称为什么吗?
Remember what you used to call those little pills?

07:27.190 --> 07:28.920
"无形的手铐"
"Invisible handcuffs."

07:29.100 --> 07:32.810
你精神上的束缚
Handcuffs on your mind.

07:33.610 --> 07:37.000
你讨厌这个 记得吗?
You hate them, remember?

07:46.650 --> 07:47.840
有电话
You got a phone call.

07:47.980 --> 07:51.510
-是谁?  -你儿子. 有急事
-Who is it?  -Your son. It's an emergency.

07:53.100 --> 07:56.010
哦 L.J. 你在想什么 孩子?
Oh, LJ, what were you thinking, kid?

07:56.150 --> 07:58.720
我豁出去了 他妈的不管了
I don't care what happens to me anymore, okay?

07:58.870 --> 08:00.720
他们赢了 他们总是赢
They won. They'll always win.

08:00.860 --> 08:03.290
我只想拖一个下水
I just wanted to take one of them down with me.

08:04.130 --> 08:07.260
让维罗妮卡听电话
Put Veronica back on.

08:09.740 --> 08:13.850
-林肯?  -什么指控?
-Lincoln?  -What are the charges?

08:13.970 --> 08:15.110
杀人未遂
Attempted murder.

08:15.250 --> 08:18.550
他同时还将被指控 谋杀她的母亲和他的继父
He's also being arraigned for the murder of his mother and his stepfather.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.330
我猜保释是不太可能了?
I guess bail is out of the question?

08:20.340 --> 08:21.570
是的
Exactly.

08:21.950 --> 08:23.560
你还能做些什么吗?
Anything you can do?

08:23.700 --> 08:26.950
此刻 唯一的希望是让他作为 未成年犯受审
Right now, his only shot is if we can get him tried as a minor.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.280
但是他必须表现出一些悔意
But he needs to show some remorse.

08:29.370 --> 08:31.860
我要向法庭表明 他只是个受到过度惊吓的孩子
I need to sell to the court that he was just a scared kid.

08:31.890 --> 08:34.350
但他现在头脑发热 根本不听我的话
But where his head's at right now, he won't listen to me.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.200
他会听我的 我得见他
He'll listen to me. I need to see him.

08:36.230 --> 08:37.500
林肯 不可能的
Lincoln, there's no way.

08:37.690 --> 08:41.220
如果他被作为成人指控 很可能也会像我一样被判死刑
He gets tried as an adult, he may as well sit in my lap in the chair.

08:41.600 --> 08:45.990
-你必须得做点什么 维罗妮卡  -好吧 我向纠正部门申请试试
-You got to do something, Veronica.  -Okay. Look, I'll petition the DOC,

08:46.050 --> 08:49.190
但允许你出去见他的可能性 几乎微乎其微
but it's a million-to-one shot they're gonna let you out to see him.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.130
好吧
All right.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.500
嘿 伙计
Yo, Trumpets.

08:59.510 --> 09:03.420
我要你尽快收回所有的欠款 行吗?
You all gotta round up all outstanding debts that are due ASAP, all right?

09:03.520 --> 09:06.620
-现在?  -跟往常一样 好吗?
-Do it right now?  -Like yesterday, all right?

09:06.720 --> 09:08.270
-我马上搞定  -好
-I'll put it out there.  -Good.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.510
你疯了?
Are you insane?

09:36.320 --> 09:38.700
没你的事了 做保镖的
You are done, bodyguard.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.060
林肯的儿子 一个16岁的吸毒小孩
Lincoln's son, a 16-year-old pothead,

09:43.200 --> 09:45.120
轻易的查到了你的住址 并打伤了你
managed to track you down and shoot you.

09:45.150 --> 09:47.750
你现在是他的案子的目击证人了
You are now a witness in his criminal investigation.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.340
我照样可以干我的活
I can still do my job.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.820
你无论如何都不能 再管布伦斯的案子了
You are not to make a move on Burrows under any circumstance.

09:52.910 --> 09:54.810
一切由我们来管
We make that call.

09:54.950 --> 09:57.190
知道吗 特里克茜?
You know what, trixie?

09:57.750 --> 10:00.280
其实我们还有更重要的任务安排要做
There are actually higher agendas here.

10:00.370 --> 10:04.720
是的 说的没错 但都没你参加的份儿了
Yes, there are, and they don't belong to you.

10:04.810 --> 10:07.910
保罗·凯勒曼不再为特勤部门工作
Paul Kellerman no longer works for the Secret Service.

10:08.520 --> 10:12.020
从现在开始 你就是以前那个欧文·克雷维克了
You're just good old Owen Kravecki from now on.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.480
我说得明白吗?
Have I made myself clear?

10:19.010 --> 10:19.720
嘿
Hey.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.250
我要你集中精力
I need you to focus.

10:24.340 --> 10:26.380
我需要你回忆起你画的东西
I need you to remember what you drew.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.540
海威尔 集体活动了
Haywire. Time for group.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.380
来吧 伙计 我们走
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.300
走吧
There we go.

10:49.990 --> 10:51.050
是条通道
It's a path.

10:53.510 --> 10:56.670
对 就是一条通道
Yes. It is a path.

10:57.550 --> 10:58.750
我们走
Let's go.

11:15.470 --> 11:16.800
什么事 伙计?
So, what's up, man?

11:17.120 --> 11:20.400
事情是这样 你什么都拿不到了
Here's the thing. You got nothing coming.

11:20.490 --> 11:23.730
你那些出色的手下 现在都是我的了
All your outstanding markers, they're mine now.

11:23.830 --> 11:24.580
是这样吗?
Is that so?

11:24.720 --> 11:27.320
觉得有问题的话 跟你那些新混混哭去吧
You got a problem with it, go cry to your new crew,

11:27.340 --> 11:29.720
帝博格和那些小白脸
T-Bag and the white boys.

11:30.050 --> 11:33.580
哦... 好 原来是关于这个
Okay, so that's what this is all about.

11:33.670 --> 11:36.010
这是关于站稳你自己
This is about staying true to your own.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.010
知道吗 伙计?
Well, you know what, man?

11:38.090 --> 11:42.250
只要我想 我可以一边和3K党的老大们喝喝茶
I can have tea with the grand wizard of the KKK if I want,

11:42.380 --> 11:45.340
一边 钱照样拿 你明白吗 臭小子?
and I still get my money. You got that, little boy?

11:45.390 --> 11:48.010
不 我们不明白
No. We don't got that.

11:48.620 --> 11:53.060
看在你以前的份上 我就让你走着离开这儿
Now, out of respect for what you once were, I'm gonna let you walk away.

13:02.410 --> 13:03.940
你说得对
You were right.

13:05.950 --> 13:08.230
药物使得我记不起那条通道
The pills don't let me see the pathway.

13:20.290 --> 13:21.980
那是一条通向地狱的路
That's a pathway to hell.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.820
不 不是 恰恰相反
No, it's not. It's just the opposite.

13:40.260 --> 13:41.840
我记起来了
I remember.

13:51.950 --> 13:55.050
看来"非洲银行"提不出钱来了
Looks like the Bank of Africa wasn't allowing any withdrawals.

13:55.140 --> 13:58.300
听着 我们得另找法子搞钱
Look, we are gonna have to find another way to get that money, okay?

13:58.330 --> 14:00.780
嗯 我想这对我们这位 在坐的朋友来说
Well, then I reckon it ain't too much of a problem

14:00.810 --> 14:03.960
搞到钱不是太难啊 对吗 D.B?
for our friend here to rummage up, ain't that so, D.B.?

14:04.100 --> 14:09.260
首先 我不是D.B库珀 其次 今天没有探监
A, I'm not D.B. Cooper, and, B, there's no visitation today.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.810
也就是说 没人可以从外面给我们捎钱
Which means that none of us can get any money from the outside world.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.640
看来只有一条路可走了
I guess that only leaves us with one real option.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.040
厨房游戏
The kitchen game.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.470
赌博? 这就你所谓的办法?
Gambling? And that's your solution?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.990
小子 相信我
Son, trust me.

14:25.130 --> 14:28.040
我玩牌的时候 那不叫赌博
When I play cards, it ain't gambling.

14:28.370 --> 14:30.810
这个国家也许只有5个人
There's maybe five people in this country that

14:30.840 --> 14:32.890
可以像我一样玩转堵牌
can do what I do with a deck of cards.

14:33.030 --> 14:35.120
为什么你现在才说?
So why are you just bringing this up now?

14:35.220 --> 14:39.140
因为如果被上帝看到我在如此玩牌
'Cause if Jesus, over there,

14:39.300 --> 14:42.340
这么说吧 我会被上帝搞死
catches you sleeving aces in the kitchen game,

14:42.570 --> 14:44.740
当然 你至少要有50美金才能坐下玩
Of course, you need 50 bucks just for the sit-in,

14:44.770 --> 14:46.470
可我们一分都没有
and since we don't have any money,

14:46.890 --> 14:50.130
我不得不说 这下我们是真陷入困境了
I'd say we're in a catch-doubley-deuce.

14:54.630 --> 14:56.920
坐这儿
You sit right here.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.900
拿好这个
Take this.

15:04.590 --> 15:05.720
还有这个
And this.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.850
哦 不... 一块没了
Oh, no. It's gone.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.520
所以我才要你补好它
That's why I need you to fix it.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.480
所以我才要你回忆起它原来是什么样子
That's why I need you to remember what was there before.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.130
哦 太糟糕了 你不能把路给弄断了
Oh, this is bad. You can't break a path.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.960
不然就找不到出路了
Then it doesn't lead anywhere.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.190
说得没错
That's right.

15:30.330 --> 15:34.870
所以我才要你回忆起我把它弄糟之前是什么样子
That's why I need you to remember what was there before it was broken.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.810
我记得
I remember.

15:38.210 --> 15:39.870
我记得有个鬼怪的图
I remember the demons.

15:39.970 --> 15:41.730
等等 也许是个朝圣者的头像
Wait, no, maybe they were pilgrims.

15:41.870 --> 15:46.180
他们指着路的方向 好像是在说:"往这边走 往这边走"
They were pointing to the way, and they were saying, "This is the way, this is the way."

15:46.970 --> 15:48.670
我不明白
I can't see it.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.440
我看的到图 但我搞不明白
I can see it, but I can't see it.

15:52.470 --> 15:54.090
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.590
嘿!
Hey!

16:03.650 --> 16:05.750
我要你帮我给苏克雷捎个信
I need you to give Sucre a message.

16:05.850 --> 16:09.190
告诉他我没事儿 我在尽量填补空白
Tell him I'm okay, and that I'm trying to fill in the blanks.

16:09.270 --> 16:10.840
他会知道我的意思
He'll know what that means.

16:10.930 --> 16:12.890
你在尽量填补空白?
You're trying to fill in the blanks?

16:12.980 --> 16:15.220
照着做就是了.拜托了
Just do it. Please.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.240
这下我该怎么办?
What the hell am I gonna do now?

16:38.040 --> 16:40.490
就我所知 你在13号牢房已经呆到现在了
You've been down in 13 as long as I can remember.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.200
为什么突然有兴趣换地方?
Why the sudden interest in moving?

16:42.210 --> 16:46.080
像这样的二层牢房并不多得
Second-story units like this don't come on the market too much.

16:46.170 --> 16:48.600
我想 年纪都已经这么大了
I figure since I'm getting on in age,

16:48.710 --> 16:51.440
是该享享清福了
maybe it's time I retired in comfort.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.980
打开40号牢房
Open on 40!

16:55.790 --> 16:56.980
动作快点
Make it quick.

17:12.580 --> 17:16.330
嘿... 鲍勃·维拉 这只是个牢房而已
Hey, Bob Vila, it's a cell.

17:16.570 --> 17:19.120
别磨蹭时间 快做出决定
Quit kicking the tires and make a decision.

17:19.230 --> 17:21.570
我付你100块 换这个房间
I'll give you 100 bucks for it.

17:21.710 --> 17:24.550
别浪费我的时间了 还是走吧
You wasted my time. Get the hell out of here.

17:24.660 --> 17:28.180
抱歉 老大 我还以为我出价不错
Sorry, boss. I thought it was a good bid.

17:28.270 --> 17:30.140
40号关上
Close on 40!

17:46.490 --> 17:48.370
好啊 本杰明(钞票上的总统头像)
Hello, Benjamin.

17:48.590 --> 17:54.020
我看看 是在19..72年制造
Now, let me see, minted in 19 and 72.

17:54.250 --> 17:58.650
这是你的本钱 剩下的只能靠你了
That's your buy-in. The rest is up to you.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.160
可恶的...
Hot damn.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.730
继续走 啄木鸟
Keep walking, peckerwood.

18:10.870 --> 18:13.020
搞到本钱了
Got the buy-in for the card game.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.630
那就去搞剩下的部分吧
Go get our money, boy.

18:14.770 --> 18:18.390
不幸的是 这次行动你必须做我的搭档
Unfortunately, you and I are gonna have to be partners in this endeavor.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.640
哦 不 不行
Oh, hell, no.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.150
我不会玩牌 我只会玩骰子
I don't play cards, I'm a dice man.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.620
听着 你只需这么做
Look, all you need to know is this,

18:23.650 --> 18:27.950
每次我发牌时 你都要赌大的 不许不要
every time I deal, you bet big and never fold.

18:28.060 --> 18:29.960
如果每次我发牌 且还都是我赢的话
See, if I'm winning every time I deal,

18:29.960 --> 18:32.970
我最后的结局会是和 哥伦比亚绳索长眠 懂我意思吗?
I end up with a Colombian necktie. You know what I'm saying?

18:33.090 --> 18:35.340
但如果每次都是你赢钱
But if you're the one raking in all the cash,

18:35.450 --> 18:39.750
他们就不会想到 其实我和你是一伙的
well, I seriously doubt anyone would ever think you and I are working together.

18:48.320 --> 18:52.530
打扰一下 哪里都找不到这手机的充电器
Excuse me. I've been all over town. I can't find a charger for this.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.450
-让我查查看  -谢谢
-Well, let me check.  -Thanks.

19:08.660 --> 19:10.430
别来无恙啊 萨维恩?
How you doing, Savrinn?

19:10.870 --> 19:12.160
你那女孩呢?
Where's your girl?

19:12.430 --> 19:14.340
她在做她的事 行吗?
She's doing her job, all right?

19:14.660 --> 19:17.050
向法院写申请书
Filing a petition down at the courts.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.050
她... 她将于一个小时后回到我的住所
She'll be at my place in about an hour.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.170
看 很容易吧
See, that was easy.

19:23.250 --> 19:26.140
我本不必向你追要那条信息的
I shouldn't have to chase you down to get that information.

19:26.170 --> 19:27.970
你为什么就不能退后一步?
Why don't you just take a step back?

19:28.010 --> 19:32.690
你为什么不想想你在跟谁讲话 我是为谁工作的?
And why don't you remember who you're talking to, who I work for?

19:35.380 --> 19:38.460
你给我认真盯着维罗妮卡·多诺万
You need to keep an eye on Veronica Donovan.

19:38.570 --> 19:41.180
不是偶尔盯着 是一直给我盯着
Not some of the time, all of the time.

19:41.290 --> 19:43.790
因为马上事态就会偏向我们这一边了
'Cause pretty soon, we're gonna call in our favor,

19:43.870 --> 19:46.740
除非你想回到我们的老交易上去
unless you want to go back on our deal.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.220
-我懂了  -很好
-No.  -Good.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.040
保持联系
Be in touch.

20:03.140 --> 20:04.000
海威尔
Haywire.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.200
海威尔... 你吃药了吗?
Haywire, did you take your meds?

20:12.530 --> 20:13.620
来
Well, come on.

20:14.030 --> 20:15.930
你牙缝里又有东西了
You got something in your teeth again.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.320
要别人回忆往事可以 但自己也得小心点儿 迈克尔
You should be careful when you tell people to remember things, Michael.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.210
因为我记起了所有的事情
Because I remember everything now.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.120
包括你是怎么陷害我的!
I remember how you set me up!

20:33.350 --> 20:36.690
以及你如何撞破你的头...
How you smashed your own head

20:36.780 --> 20:40.410
害得我被遣送到这里
and had me sent back here.

20:40.550 --> 20:41.860
我同时...
I also

20:42.470 --> 20:44.230
也记起了这个
remember this.

20:47.930 --> 20:49.220
通道
The pathway.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.370
你的地图
Your map.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.820
你的越狱
Your escape.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.830
-给我  -别.别
-Give me that.  -Don't. Don't.

20:58.540 --> 21:02.060
现在 你是要我把这撕了...
Now, do I tear this up

21:03.080 --> 21:07.430
...还是告诉我 何时 何地开始你的越狱行动?
or do you tell me exactly where and when you're doing this?

21:17.750 --> 21:20.100
-从地下室开始  -好
-It starts in the basement.  -Okay.

21:21.720 --> 21:26.560
这条线连接着煤房舱口和这边的管道系统
This line leads from the hatch in the coal room, to this pipe system here,

21:26.640 --> 21:28.740
而那条线可以通到医务室
and that runs to the infirmary.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.730
我们就是走这条线出去的
That's how we'll get out.

21:30.870 --> 21:33.220
我得离开精神病区补全工作
I just need to get out of psych ward to set things up.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.300
三天以后
But three days after I'm gone,

21:35.440 --> 21:38.710
我再折回到地下室把你接出去
I'll come back up through the basement and get you out.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.600
你只是说些我想听的话
You're just telling me what I want to hear.

21:40.630 --> 21:41.410
不 我没有
No, I'm not.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.120
我需要你帮我们离开这儿
I need you to let me get us out of here.

21:45.850 --> 21:47.890
你需要相信我
I need you to trust me.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.870
如果你再陷害我 我会杀了你
If you try to screw me over again I'll kill you.

22:12.300 --> 22:12.900
嘿
Hey.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.920
嘿 进展怎么样?
Hi. How did it go?

22:16.050 --> 22:17.770
申请是挺容易的
Filing the petition was easy,

22:17.850 --> 22:20.480
但能否通过 那就是另一回事儿了
getting it approved, that's a whole 'nother story.

22:22.630 --> 22:25.030
-你找到充电器了?  -哦 是的
-You found the charger?  -Oh, yeah.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.910
你怎么不把它装上去?
Why didn't you plug it in?

22:31.000 --> 22:34.340
我只是在 嗯... 在想些其它的事情
I was just... Just thinking for a minute.

22:34.390 --> 22:37.140
-想什么?  -没什么
-About what?  -Nothing.

22:41.260 --> 22:44.030
-看来有事做了  -什么?
-We're in business.  -What is it?

22:44.120 --> 22:47.580
他的整本电话簿都还在 总共322个号码
His entire phone book is still in here, 322 numbers.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.700
没空位了 旁边等等
No open seats. Gotta wait.

23:24.880 --> 23:29.010
西诺 押还是不押?
C-Note, crap or get off the pot.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.250
我再想想
I'm thinking.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.700
嘿 我们这不是在加拿大扑克邀请赛上玩
We ain't betting on CPT here, man.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.000
你要么跟 要么滚开让位置
Either you gonna see his bet or you can go outside

23:35.030 --> 23:38.100
去搞个囚犯大游行什么的 随你怎么搞
and Million Con March or whatever your people do.

23:38.180 --> 23:40.130
不管你选择哪一种 快做决定就是了 伙计
Either way, get on with it, son.

23:43.980 --> 23:45.070
我跟
I'm in.

23:47.360 --> 23:53.920
三张Q娘么 你的呢?
Three bitches, bitches. What you holding?

23:58.530 --> 24:00.020
你说呢
You tell me.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.090
-满堂红  -满堂红?
-Full house.  -A full house?

24:04.230 --> 24:08.820
这东西 墨西哥人应该非常熟悉 嗯 小子?
That's a concept a Mexican should be quite familiar with, eh, Jesus?

24:13.950 --> 24:15.210
她说什么?
She said what?

24:15.370 --> 24:17.050
她毫不含糊说
She said, in unequivocal terms,

24:17.200 --> 24:18.900
布伦斯的事我不准再插手
that I was not to move on Burrows.

24:19.070 --> 24:21.820
不管他们有何计划 和我们的肯定不一样
Whatever their agenda is with Burrows, it is not the same as ours.

24:22.220 --> 24:23.830
他父亲的介入 
This whole business with his father,

24:23.860 --> 24:26.030
阻碍了我们最初计划的实施
it interferes with the one thing that we set out to do in the first place.

24:26.060 --> 24:29.580
使我们对林肯·布伦斯的 一切行程安排落空
Put Lincoln Burrows in the ground.

24:29.740 --> 24:33.970
只要他活着 你就只能等着认输 而不是公司
If he lives, you're the one that stands to lose, not the Company.

24:34.060 --> 24:35.960
他们会再选个候选人
They get themselves another candidate,

24:35.960 --> 24:38.290
而你却得承担所有损失
and you're the one that suffers the brunt of it.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.350
也许是时候搞乱他们的棋盘了
Then maybe it's time we broke ranks.

24:42.490 --> 24:46.240
如果我们那么做 他们将不再支持你的竞选 这你是知道的
We do that, they pull support for the campaign. You know that, don't you?

24:46.910 --> 24:50.960
前提是... 如果被他们知道 保罗
That is, if they know, Paul.

24:54.250 --> 25:01.020
嗯! 闻闻这些钱的味道 得来一对J或者更好 来三个就赢了
Smell that kitty. Jacks or better, Trips to win.

25:05.900 --> 25:10.220
最后一手了 我今天已经输得不耐烦了
Last hand. I'm tired of losing all my money today.

25:11.250 --> 25:15.910
-你那有多少?  -不知道 300上下
-How much you up?  -I don't know. $300.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.070
-疼吗?  -什么?
-Does it hurt?  -What?

25:18.310 --> 25:20.070
你屁股上的马蹄铁 (意指狗屎运)
The horseshoe up your ass.

25:20.210 --> 25:23.070
今天运气很好 乒乓小子
Rather be lucky than good, ping-pong.

25:29.380 --> 25:32.230
掉牌得弃牌
Misdeal. Bury the card.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.270
伙计 我不在乎你有没看到我的牌
Man, I don't care if you all saw my card.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.720
是啊 你当然不在乎
Yeah, I bet you don't.

25:36.860 --> 25:38.760
弃牌吧 毛小子
Bury the card, young blood.

25:38.850 --> 25:42.860
嘿 扫兴的家伙 这又不是我的错
Hey, chill, wrinkles. Ain't my fault saltine here got a sloppy deal.

25:43.020 --> 25:44.940
啊 这种事情谁料得到 
That there was just uncalled for.

25:45.020 --> 25:46.730
好吧 听着 要不这么做
Now, all right. You know what? I'll tell you what.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.060
我重新洗牌 你们也不要太孩子脾气了
I'm gonna deal another hand, you gonna be such a baby about it.

25:52.190 --> 25:57.080
发错牌 就得弃牌 把牌发完
On a misdeal, you bury the card, finish out the hand.

25:57.230 --> 25:59.010
这是规矩
House rules.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.470
狱长
Warden.

26:35.730 --> 26:37.750
有好消息 林肯
I have some good news for you, Linc.

26:38.170 --> 26:41.080
不知怎的 你的律师的申请通过了
Somehow, your lawyer's petition went through.

26:42.020 --> 26:45.870
纠正部门给你一个小时的时间来探望你儿子
The Department of Corrections is allowing you a one-hour visit with your son.

26:47.220 --> 26:51.500
我还从没见过有这种优待 从没有
I've never seen one of these granted before, ever.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.240
好律师
Good lawyers.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.440
没律师能好到这种程度
No lawyer's that good.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.450
我去安排行程
I'll make the travel arrangements,

26:58.480 --> 27:00.190
不过这不是全国旅行
but this is not going to be a ride in the country.

27:00.220 --> 27:02.830
你照样会被铐住 并有人全副武装看守
You're gonna be y-cuffed, and the men are gonna be heavily armed.

27:02.860 --> 27:04.290
我不想造成任何不必要的麻烦
I don't want any problems.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.580
不会的 我只想见见我的儿子
There won't be, I just want to see my son.

27:24.490 --> 27:26.210
我全压了
I'll bet all I got.

27:30.470 --> 27:31.730
82块钱
$82.

27:33.840 --> 27:37.070
除非你运气好到连来几张A
You better have some aces shoved up there with that horseshoe,

27:37.230 --> 27:43.920
否则我赢定了 跟还是不跟?
or that pot's mine. You in or out?

28:12.080 --> 28:13.270
我跟
I'm in.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.750
再加74块
And I raise you $74.

28:21.030 --> 28:23.340
我说了我只有82
I said I only got $82 left.

28:23.450 --> 28:24.990
我只能说你今天不走运
Well, then I guess you're out of luck.

28:25.020 --> 28:26.580
你没听说过这是绅士游戏吗?
You never heard of a gentleman's game?

28:26.610 --> 28:28.170
是的 我听说过 但这次不算
Yes, I have, but this ain't it.

28:28.960 --> 28:32.230
要不要借点钱? 向你手下问问
You want to borrow some money? Ask your boys.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.000
我今天是来这里赢钱的 老兄
But I'm in here to make money, bro.

28:35.150 --> 28:38.540
你想要福利 最好投票给民主党 
You want welfare, you'd better vote Democrat.

28:53.410 --> 28:55.210
你知道怎么做对你有好处
If you know what's good for you,

28:55.300 --> 28:57.240
最好在院子里离我远远的
you'll stay away from me in the yard.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.480
你以为你比我更聪明?
You think you're smarter than me?

29:37.790 --> 29:40.000
不!不!不 不 不!
No, no, no!

29:41.350 --> 29:44.220
有条通道  不 有条通道!有条通道!
Okay, there's a pathway. No, there's a pathway! There's a pathway!

29:44.250 --> 29:47.690
他想逃跑! 他想逃跑  这就是他的地图
Look, he's trying to escape! He's trying to escape. This is his map!

29:48.210 --> 29:49.980
他陷害我!
He set me up!

29:50.050 --> 29:51.100
电击!
Zap him!

30:07.270 --> 30:08.370
他来了
There he is.

30:14.420 --> 30:17.500
嘿 老大 你掉了点东西
Hey, boss. I think you dropped something, man.

30:19.510 --> 30:22.360
这里有500 什么时候让我搬进去?
That's half a G-note. So when do I move in?

30:22.540 --> 30:24.290
-不用搬  -什么?
-You don't.  -What?

30:24.440 --> 30:26.520
拜托 头儿 我们说好的
Oh, come on, chief, now, we had a deal.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.700
新价 涨到700了
Renegotiation, the price is $700 now.

30:30.440 --> 30:33.660
这样太说不过去了 我已经给你500了
That ain't right. I just gave you $500.

30:33.780 --> 30:35.880
你给我的只是定金
What you gave me was a down payment.

30:36.030 --> 30:38.060
如果你支付不了余下部分 那么...
If you can't come up with the rest, well...

30:38.090 --> 30:41.860
不 不 不 不 不! 等 等 等 稍等一会儿
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on. One minute, all right?

30:45.590 --> 30:48.050
这家伙想把我们淘空
Oh, man, he's trying to shake us down.

30:48.230 --> 30:50.970
-我需要你的表  -没门儿
-I'm gonna need that watch.  -Not an option.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.430
听着 你是宁可在这里看你女儿的照片呢
Look, would you rather be looking at a picture of your daughter

30:54.850 --> 30:58.340
还是想出去并有机会抱她一下?
or holding her in your arms once you get outside?

31:19.870 --> 31:22.970
听着 伙计 老头儿欠我些钱
Hey, look, man, Father Time owed me a few bones.

31:23.050 --> 31:24.960
用这个作抵押了
He gave me this in trade.

31:25.110 --> 31:27.400
现在多的都有了
That should be more than enough to cover it.

31:27.530 --> 31:29.040
嗯 还不赖
Not bad.

31:29.330 --> 31:35.250
问题是已经有人出价700要那个房间了 看来你被卡住了
Your problem is somebody already gave me $700 for the cell, so, you're S.O.L.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.590
不! 嘿 等等! 等等! 等等!
No! No! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Look.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.720
你想拿了我的钱就走人?
So you're just gonna take my money and walk?

31:40.750 --> 31:43.210
是啊 写信去投诉我吧
Yeah, well, write to your congressman.

31:48.580 --> 31:49.820
要命了!
Oh, come on!

32:02.000 --> 32:02.680
来了
Hey.

32:02.970 --> 32:05.350
恩 他们说你想跟我谈谈
Hi. They said you wanted to talk to me.

32:05.450 --> 32:08.030
是的 是啊
Yeah, yeah.

32:08.290 --> 32:09.160
好吧
Okay.

32:09.690 --> 32:10.380
好
Good.

32:14.080 --> 32:14.930
请坐
Please.

32:17.350 --> 32:18.340
谢谢
Thanks.

32:20.970 --> 32:22.490
我给你做了个东西
I made you something.

32:29.290 --> 32:30.620
是个烟灰缸
It's an ashtray.

32:30.770 --> 32:32.480
嗯... 可我不抽烟
I don't smoke.

32:32.650 --> 32:36.910
是 我知道 但他们只让我们做这个和珠宝
Yeah, I know. But they only let us make these and jewelry,

32:37.060 --> 32:39.810
而且我觉得你不是那种喜欢带面条项链的人
and I didn't figure you for the macaroni necklace type.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.850
真好! 嗯...
It's very sweet.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.070
我们谈谈你的情况吧?
How about we talk about how you're doing?

32:47.990 --> 32:50.810
我想 你和我都知道 我不应该呆这里
I think we both know I don't belong here.

32:50.990 --> 32:53.640
我记不清那晚发生了什么事
I don't remember much about that night,

32:53.740 --> 32:57.940
但被关单独禁闭的时候 一定是什么东西让我头脑发涨
but being locked up in ad seg, something must've snapped.

32:59.650 --> 33:03.460
我想说的是 我已经干了很多的手工艺活
What I'm trying to say is, I think I've had enough of arts and crafts.

33:04.730 --> 33:06.430
但那是由你决定的
But that's your call.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.160
这里的医生确实是说 你表现还不错
And the doctors here do say that you've been acting fine.

33:09.190 --> 33:11.530
问题是 如果你不告诉狱长是谁烫伤了你
The problem is that if you don't tell the Pope who burned you,

33:11.560 --> 33:13.960
他还是会把你单独禁闭的
he's gonna lock you back up in ad seg.

33:14.060 --> 33:17.310
几天以后 你可能又会被送回来
And after a couple days of that, you're gonna be right back here.

33:21.590 --> 33:25.310
迈克尔 我很不愿看到在你身上发生的一切 以及你坐在这儿
Michael, I hate what happened to you, and I hate that you're here.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.550
但你得让我帮你
But you have got to let me help you.

33:29.910 --> 33:33.370
如果你想离开这个精神病区 
If you want to get out of psych ward, and stay out,

33:33.490 --> 33:36.190
你就得把事实告诉狱长
you've got to tell the Pope the truth about that burn.

33:39.470 --> 33:42.380
换洗衣物了 朋友们
Out with the old, in with the new, cons.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.380
你室友让我给你捎个信儿 哥
I got a message from your cellie, bro.

33:54.490 --> 33:57.790
他说他没事儿 并努力填补空白
He says he's okay and he's trying to fill in the blanks.

33:57.900 --> 34:01.070
他说他正在尝试 还是说已经填好了?
Did he say he's trying, or that he already got the blanks filled in?

34:01.100 --> 34:03.400
我不知道 我没写下来
Yo, man, I don't know. I didn't write it down.

34:03.430 --> 34:06.440
好吧 你告诉他 我已经把洞填平了
Okay. Now you gotta tell him that I filled in the hole.

34:06.590 --> 34:10.200
好 好 我已经厌烦了你的秘密和口信儿
Yeah, yeah, I'm done with your little secrets and messages, bro.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.140
我看到斯科菲尔德的背部了
I saw Scofield's back.

34:12.230 --> 34:15.490
他背部被烫伤的部分 和警服的那一块是同一个位置
He's got a burn in the same spot as the burn in that guard's shirt.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.330
我不知道你在干什么 但我已经有点头绪了
I don't know what you're doing but I have an idea, huh?

34:19.430 --> 34:22.870
除非你告诉我发生了什么事 否则我不帮你了
And I'm through helping you until you tell me what's going on.

34:23.010 --> 34:24.330
我不能告诉你 兄弟
I can't, bro.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.080
那祝你好运吧
Then good luck in the hole, jefe.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.970
不 不 不 不 不! 等 等
No, no, no! Wait, wait.

34:29.070 --> 34:29.630
曼而彻
Manche.

34:30.430 --> 34:31.760
谁在叫?
Who's that?

34:32.180 --> 34:33.650
是林肯 兄弟
That's Linc, bro.

34:33.930 --> 34:35.580
-判死刑的林肯?  -是的
-Linc the Sink?  -Yeah.

34:35.760 --> 34:36.470
过来
Come here.

34:48.270 --> 34:50.450
我想我们可以解决点问题
I think we can work something out.

34:51.360 --> 34:56.420
我想说的是 在我离开这儿之前 加里会付出代价的 相信我
All I can say is, before I get out of here, Geary will pay. Believe that.

34:56.690 --> 35:00.750
如果维修部换新了斯科菲尔德的马桶 谁都走不了
No one's getting out of here if maintenance goes to replacing Scofield's toilet.

35:01.580 --> 35:04.140
我有办法帮你们 解决斯科菲尔德的问题
I got a way to help you with your Scofield problem.

35:04.250 --> 35:05.720
你说什么 瘦竹竿?
What'd you say, slim?

35:05.900 --> 35:07.840
我说我有办法帮你们...
I said I got a way to help you with...

35:08.810 --> 35:10.820
谁告诉你我们有问题?
Who the hell said we had a problem?

35:10.940 --> 35:12.430
冷静点 老兄 放轻松
It's cool, man. Relax.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.180
林肯和苏克雷把什么都告诉我了
Lincoln and Sucre told me everything.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.230
他们告诉你什么了?
What in the hell did they tell you?

35:17.310 --> 35:18.860
他们到底告诉你什么了?
Exactly, what did they tell you?

35:18.950 --> 35:21.460
什么都说了 他们说 我可以和你们一起
Everything. They said I can come with you, you know,

35:21.490 --> 35:25.090
提前假释 如果我能帮你们 把迈克尔弄出精神病区的话
on early parole, if I can help get the Fish out of psych.

35:26.350 --> 35:30.010
我们算什么 火车吗? 你以为谁都能上我们的火车?
What are we, the A train? Everyone gets to ride with us?

35:31.270 --> 35:34.840
在我给你一拳之前 先给我滚蛋?
Why don't you take a walk, before I give you a smack?

35:36.760 --> 35:39.900
你有其它的好办法吗?
You got another solution to our situation?

35:42.710 --> 35:44.520
我可不这么认为
I didn't think so.

35:47.800 --> 35:53.990
我 我堂哥还有林肯... 想了个法子
Me and my cuz and Lincoln came up with something.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.490
行得通... 但有一定风险
Now, it can work, but it's risky.

36:13.310 --> 36:15.990
准备好离开这鱼缸了吗 小鱼儿?
You ready to get out of this aquarium, Fish?

37:20.810 --> 37:23.060
你必须保证我没事
Assure me I'll be protected.

37:23.620 --> 37:28.160
迈克尔 你已经够了解我了 你知道我会怎么做
Michael, you know me well enough by now. Such assurances are not necessary.

37:28.250 --> 37:29.870
恕我直言 狱长
With all due respect, Warden,

37:29.980 --> 37:33.830
如果当初安全措施够好的话 那样的事就不会发生了
if I had been protected in the first place, none of this would have happened.

37:42.450 --> 37:43.170
名字
A name.

37:45.100 --> 37:48.210
-加里  -加里?
-Geary.  -Geary?

37:48.390 --> 37:52.450
他想尽办法从我们这捞钱 不择手段
He shakes cons down for money, anything he can get his hands on.

37:52.730 --> 37:54.880
他知道我上过大学 所以他理所当然认为我...
He knew I went to college, so he must've...

37:55.340 --> 37:57.720
他一定认为我很有钱
He must've thought I was rich or something.

37:57.910 --> 37:59.640
总之 当 嗯...
Anyway,

37:59.820 --> 38:02.890
我付不出钱的时候 他用一只手把我摁住
when I couldn't pay up, he held me down with one arm,

38:04.030 --> 38:05.710
用另一只手烫我
and burned me with the other.

38:09.030 --> 38:10.850
我不知道他用什么烫的 但...
but it was hot as hell. but

38:12.530 --> 38:13.760
真的是烫的要命
it was hot as hell.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.800
真是让人诧异啊 又接不通

38:31.330 --> 38:34.510
魁恩一失踪 几天内他们就把数据全部销毁了
As soon as Quinn disappeared, they must've erased the paper trail within days.

38:34.540 --> 38:36.660
还有什么他们办不到的?
Is there anything they can't do?

38:38.820 --> 38:40.600
我在华盛顿的朋友
My P.I. Buddy in DC.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.200
我把这个都寄过去
What if I send him all this,

38:42.200 --> 38:44.750
看他能不能在这些号码之间找到某种联系?
see if he can make a connection between the numbers?

38:44.780 --> 38:46.900
我会告诉他尽快
I'll tell him I need it ASAP.

38:47.080 --> 38:47.980

Thank you.

38:48.170 --> 38:51.110
没什么大不了的 我会让他通宵处理这些材料
Oh, it's no big deal. I'll just overnight him all this stuff.

38:53.810 --> 38:55.330

38:55.890 --> 38:58.190

39:09.060 --> 39:12.000
你也干得很遭 你也向狱长要求加薪啊
You suck at your job. You should ask the Pope for a raise.

39:12.180 --> 39:13.350
很有意思
Very funny.

39:19.250 --> 39:21.880
狱长 什么风把你吹来了?
Warden, what brings you to our little clubhouse?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.220
嘿 是什么...?
Hey, what gives?

39:49.560 --> 39:51.280

40:33.290 --> 40:36.870
别像看罪犯那样看着我 你也不是个好东西

40:39.520 --> 40:41.500
我没有被抓住
I don't get caught.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.440

我会卸下你的手铐 让你稍微活动一下
I'll take you out of the y-cuffs and put you in a four-piece.

什么都看
Everything.
