02:07.690 --> 02:09.000
你在说我是个骗子?
You calling me a liar now?

02:09.010 --> 02:10.430
他说你满口谎话
He says you're full of it.

02:10.820 --> 02:12.530
他说他从没做一个大使
He said he was never an ambassador.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.030

02:15.330 --> 02:16.750

02:26.700 --> 02:28.190
我经常磕药
I was high half the time.

02:28.580 --> 02:30.150
这也是我被炒的原因

02:30.940 --> 02:32.360
是我在这儿的原因

02:32.370 --> 02:33.810

41分钟 但我们还没办法进禁入区

02:42.520 --> 02:44.870
-只是我得先查探一下 -那监狱围栏呢?

你那个掘墓人朋友只洒过一次药水
Your grave digger friends only sprayed the thing once,

02:46.490 --> 02:48.180
我可不希望今天我被上电刑
And I'd just assume not get electrocuted today.

苏克雷多洒一次会让我更有安心点吗 是的
Would I feel better if Sucre had sprayed the fence again? Yes.

02:50.390 --> 02:52.400
这可能吗 不
Is that an option? No.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.660
除非他又有进来的理由
Unless he had another reason to be there.

02:54.960 --> 02:55.530
你要做什么?
What are you going to do?

02:55.540 --> 02:57.630
杀个人好让他进来洒药水?
Kill someone to get more spray on the fence?

02:57.790 --> 03:00.310
我倒想杀了你 如果这能帮我们逃出去的话
I'd think about killing you if it helped us get out of here today.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.520
知道什么能帮我们逃出去吗
You know what'll help us get out of here?

03:02.530 --> 03:03.530
一把梯子
A ladder.

03:03.730 --> 03:04.640
迈克
Michael

03:05.560 --> 03:07.680
我们逃出去后要去哪儿?
where are we gonna go once we get through that fence?

03:08.950 --> 03:10.300
去弄把梯子来
Just get me a ladder.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.490
这张吊床比以前那个短
This hammock's shorter than the last one.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.110
那我们得弄点别的东西来接长它
Well, we might need something to extend it.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.870
好了 我来想办法
All right, I'll take care of it.

03:20.980 --> 03:22.550
我从没去过尼斯
I've never been to Nice.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.290
听说那儿很美

03:24.860 --> 03:25.800
我怎么知道
I wouldn't know.

03:25.810 --> 03:27.610
我不管这个人是不是认识你
I don't care if this guy knows you or not.

03:27.620 --> 03:28.780
我在意的是
But what I do care about is

03:28.790 --> 03:31.420
他很明显一直在盯着你
his apparent fixation with watching you at all times.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.920

03:34.120 --> 03:35.540

03:35.550 --> 03:36.680

Come to my cell, I'll teach you.

03:52.420 --> 03:55.290

You want me to come back to your cell and"roll bones"?

我昨天给了你吃的
I gave you food yesterday.

04:05.090 --> 04:06.850
我给了你睡觉的地方

04:06.860 --> 04:07.930
我很好奇原因
I wonder why.

04:08.770 --> 04:09.500
你该死的有什么毛病?
What the hell is your problem?

04:09.510 --> 04:12.650
听着 我不想和你上床 明白吗
Look, I just don't want to have sex with you, okay?

04:15.060 --> 04:16.460

04:30.020 --> 04:31.910
要穿过禁入区
To make it across no-man's-land,

04:39.900 --> 04:40.510
是他的午休时间

04:40.520 --> 04:41.870
他会喝一杯咖啡
He gets a cup of coffee.

04:41.990 --> 04:45.050
你得找出放杯子的地方 下点药进去
You need to find out where and put something in that cup.

04:45.060 --> 04:46.920
确保我们越狱时他意识不清
Make sure he's unconscious during the escape.

看看有没有办法把莎拉和LJ救出来
to figure out if we can get LJ and Sara out of there

05:05.640 --> 05:07.130

几年前 我在摩苏尔打仗
A couple of years ago, I was serving in Mosul.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.920
我被敌人俘虏了
And I was taken prisoner.

06:47.580 --> 06:48.600
过了几个漫长的晚上后

06:48.610 --> 06:52.160
我听到了美军直升机的声音
I could hear the sound of U.S. Army helicopters.

06:52.410 --> 06:53.900
越来越近

06:55.940 --> 06:57.350

06:57.360 --> 06:58.920
但我还是逃了
and I I ran.

06:59.340 --> 07:00.960
我当时没有想到
It didn't occur to me

07:01.070 --> 07:03.050
如果这是一次营救任务
that if this was a rescue mission,

07:03.480 --> 07:05.690
那么敌人也会听到直升机声音的
my captors could hear the choppers.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.710
我没有想到
It didn't occur to me

07:07.720 --> 07:10.640
这次的任务其实是人质交换
that this was actually a hostage exchange,

07:12.330 --> 07:13.320
但是
and that

07:13.670 --> 07:16.320
我的逃跑会被视为
jumping would be viewed

07:16.660 --> 07:18.420
敌对行为
as a hostile act.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.420
我很快又被抓起来了
I got recaptured immediately.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.410
6名突击队员死于

And for the next three weeks

07:39.100 --> 07:40.360
这么说吧
Let's just say

07:41.640 --> 07:42.860
人都是畜牲
men are pigs.

07:47.810 --> 07:49.070
我们丑话说在前头
Let's be clear.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.690
这是一次交换
This is an exchange.

07:53.660 --> 07:55.410
不要逞能
If you don't try to be a hero,

07:55.480 --> 07:57.240
这样你和你爸爸都不会有事
you and your father will be okay.

07:58.070 --> 07:59.960

Okay? Okay.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.290

Norman? Norman?

08:13.310 --> 08:14.010

As you can imagine,

08:14.020 --> 08:15.300
他喜欢勒齐
he prefers Lechero.

08:15.310 --> 08:16.340
诺曼?
Norman?

08:16.730 --> 08:19.140
他不管你交不交保护费都会杀了你
He kills you before or after he does your taxes.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.570
他杀你可不需要理由
He Kills you when he pleases.

08:23.950 --> 08:25.390
我口渴了
I'm feeling thirsty.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.620
你为什么不帮我们拿点喝的 小子
Why don't you go fix us something to drink, boy?

08:27.630 --> 08:29.270
也许你还没接到通知
Maybe you ain't got the memorandum,

08:29.280 --> 08:30.860
我已经被提升了
but I've been promoted.

08:31.020 --> 08:32.140
小子
Boy.

08:35.730 --> 08:36.910
你刚才对我说什么?
What did you say to me?

08:37.860 --> 08:38.940
有什么事吗
What's the problem?

08:39.960 --> 08:41.600
有人打肿脸充胖子
Stumpy herand his mouth.

08:41.610 --> 08:42.620
就是这个问题
That's the problem.

08:42.630 --> 08:44.340

我会和他谈谈 你出去
I'll talk to him. Leave.

08:50.410 --> 08:50.990

This isn't over.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.170
都出去
Leave

08:58.830 --> 08:59.760

We was just, uh

09:01.190 --> 09:02.430

The favor you owe me

09:02.440 --> 09:03.890
你发现了什么吗
What have you found out?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.810
这种事情是要时间的
A thing like this takes time.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.380
我不可能走到他面前直接问
I can't just walk up to them and say,"Hey, whoever's been

09:08.390 --> 09:10.640
谁背叛了勒齐请举手
betraying Lechero, raise your hand."You know?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.960
我让你在这里当我的耳线
I asked you to be my ears in this prison,

09:12.970 --> 09:14.340
你什么料都收不到?
and you hear nothing?

09:14.350 --> 09:16.450
我只知道每一次我坐下来准备
All I know is every time I try and sit down and begin

09:16.460 --> 09:19.230
了解点什么的时候 萨米总是扯开话题
sussing things out, Sammy always changes the subject.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.860
我不是说他就是叛徒 但
Not that I'm saying he's the guy, but

09:20.870 --> 09:23.390
我不想听你的理论
I don't want to hear your theories.

09:24.090 --> 09:25.390
我要的是结论
I want results.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.350
情况还好吗
Is everything okay?

09:46.510 --> 09:48.230
-詹姆斯怎么样? -是的 他很好
Is James all right? Yeah, he's fine.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.220
这东西哪里来的?
Where is this from?

09:51.620 --> 09:53.110
乌瑞伯 在波德格的
Uribe's, the roadside

09:53.120 --> 09:54.910
路边 就几公里远
Bodega a few kilometers away.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.920
如果我想你去辩认一个警卫
If I needed you to ID a specific guard

09:56.920 --> 09:58.320
哨塔的警卫 你能做得到吗?
a tower guard could you do it?

09:59.320 --> 10:00.820
我只是不想被抓起来
I just don't want to get busted.

10:00.820 --> 10:01.820
到底能不能做到?
Could you do it or not?

10:02.320 --> 10:03.220
可以
Yes.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.120
-林肯? -是的
Lincoln? Yeah.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.920
-什么事? -我需要点帮助
What is it? I need something.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.210
蒂博格也干不了什么坏事的 老兄
Teodoro's harmless, man.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.820
-他是一个 小丑 -一个该死的小丑
He's a he's clown. He's a dead clown.

10:48.220 --> 10:49.610
老兄 我不会到处说
Hey, man, I wasn't going to say anything,

10:49.620 --> 10:52.120
但是 昨晚
but, uh, last night,

10:53.220 --> 10:55.820
我在找扑克的时候 你猜怎么着
I was looking for my playing cards and guess what?

10:57.520 --> 10:58.520
我发现了这个
I found these.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.120
你竟然瞒着我
You're holding out on me.

11:00.920 --> 11:01.810
喜欢都拿去
Take'em.

11:01.820 --> 11:02.920
口感很差
They taste nasty.

11:03.220 --> 11:06.120
老兄 你找不到再好的雪茄了
Man, you cannot get a better cigar than this.

11:06.220 --> 11:08.220
你从谁那里拿的? 奥古斯特?
Where'd you get these? Augusto?

11:09.020 --> 11:10.010
他要给我 我也阻止不了
I can't make him stop sending them in to me,

11:10.020 --> 11:12.020
不过我可不是他的人 你明白吗?
but I don't work for him, you understand?

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
你确定不介意?
You sure you don't mind?

11:49.920 --> 11:51.720
我在这附近
I was in the neighborhood.

11:56.220 --> 11:57.920
我那么老远过来探望我?
You came all this way to visit?

11:58.520 --> 11:59.920
我来是想把你弄出来
I came to get you out of here.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.110
我能在48小时之后把你转去Schaum
I can have you in Schaum Correctional Facility

12:02.120 --> 12:03.320
的监禁中心
in 48 hours.

12:04.420 --> 12:05.520
在圣路易斯
In St. Louis.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.410
苏林斯希望把你关在相对戒备森严的地方
Sullins wanted a medium security,

12:07.420 --> 12:09.420
但我说服了他
but, uh, talked him down.

12:09.820 --> 12:11.420
他给我什么的方案作为交易?
What sort of deal is he getting me?

12:11.620 --> 12:13.020
25年?
25 years?

12:13.320 --> 12:14.320
终身监禁?
Life?

12:14.420 --> 12:16.310
上级给予我们很大的让步
The director's giving us a lot of latitude

12:16.320 --> 12:18.210
以此交换你在政府对林肯·布鲁斯
in exchange for testimony against the government

12:18.220 --> 12:19.820
这次阴谋事件上的证词
in the Lincoln Burrows conspiracy.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.720
那么
So

12:23.120 --> 12:24.620
8年怎么样?
how does eight years sound?

12:26.220 --> 12:27.920
苏林斯安排好
Soon as Sullins finishes up,

12:27.920 --> 12:29.320
我们准备好车
we can have a van ready

12:30.020 --> 12:31.220
我不接受
I don't think so.

12:32.020 --> 12:33.020
什么?
What?

12:33.720 --> 12:35.310
谢谢你们的努力
I appreciate the effort,

12:35.320 --> 12:39.320
你的努力 但是 我不能忍受被关押8年
your effort, but, um, I can't do eight years.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.020
你现在最起码要坐10年
You're doing ten now.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.720
政府现在需要你做点事
The government is calling in some favors.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.310
一旦你回到美国 如果你不合作
Once you're in the U.S., if you don't cooperate,

12:47.320 --> 12:48.410
他们会起诉你所有的犯罪行为
they're going to charge you with everything.

12:48.420 --> 12:50.320
那可包括多起谋杀案的
That's multiple homicide counts.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.310
你不答应这交易
Without this deal,

12:56.320 --> 12:58.620
你一辈子都要在牢里了
you are gonna be in prison for the rest of your life.

13:01.220 --> 13:02.720
谢谢你们的努力
I appreciate the effort,

13:03.320 --> 13:04.420
你的努力
your effort.

13:05.420 --> 13:06.420
但我不能
But I can't.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.920
阿历克斯
Alex.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.300
我们行动的时候 如果
While we're getting out of here, and

13:16.100 --> 13:17.500
如果我不能成功
if I don't make it,

13:18.300 --> 13:20.600
你能答应我一定将这个给我女朋友吗
will you make sure this gets to my girlfriend?

13:23.600 --> 13:24.700
好的
All right.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.490
你知道的 如果你 我也可以帮你这么做
You know, uh I could do the same for you.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.000
把这个绑紧了
Tie an anchor bend there.

13:34.800 --> 13:35.490
我只是提一下
I was just offering.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.600
你知道吗 如果我逃不出去
You know what, if I'm the one who doesn't make it,

13:37.700 --> 13:39.200
如果你真心想帮我
and you really want to do me a favor,

13:39.200 --> 13:40.800
就是坚持与对方的谈判
just hold up your end of the bargain.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.900
我会尽我所能的
I'll do everything I can.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.100
我希望那是真的
I hope that's true.

13:46.300 --> 13:47.500
那个结是从哪来的?
How's that knot coming?

13:49.300 --> 13:50.400
你看
There.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.200
我合格了吗?
Did I pass your test?

13:54.200 --> 13:55.800
我告诉过你我是个渔民
I told you I'm a fisherman.

13:58.000 --> 13:58.790
进展如何?
Where are we?

13:58.800 --> 14:00.890
我发现了一个能让我们到达禁入区的牢房
I found a cell that'll get us into no-man's-land.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.090
比从我的旧牢房到达围墙要远一些
It's a longer run to the fence than my old one,

14:03.100 --> 14:04.300
但必须得从那走
but it's gonna have to do.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.000
哪一间? 谁住那?
Which one? Who liveshere?

14:06.600 --> 14:08.700
帕波乔还有萨米
Papo, Cheo and Sammy.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.600
听着 我知道你在想什么
Look, I know what you're thinking,

14:10.700 --> 14:12.390
但这是第二层唯一另一间
but it's the only other cell on the second floor

14:12.400 --> 14:14.990
可以不被岗哨发现直达围墙的牢房
with a direct line to the fence, where we won't be seen

14:15.000 --> 14:16.590
我们怎么保证
the other tower guards. And how do we

14:16.600 --> 14:17.990
他们不会在那出现?
guarantee that they won't be there?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.990
到两点时 每个人都会到操场
By 2:00, everyone should be out in the courtyard

14:20.000 --> 14:21.800
观看午餐足球比赛
for the lunchtime soccer game.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.100
你确信那还没开始?
You sure it hasn't started already?

14:33.900 --> 14:36.600
某人不经过决斗来解决问题
Someone went outside the ring to settle a dispute.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.990
现在 谁破坏了这个规矩
Now, anyone who affronts our justice system

14:41.000 --> 14:43.100
谁就要被依此受惩罚
in this way must be punished.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.500
现在 我知道那懦夫不敢吭声
Now, I know the coward won't come forward.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.000
但如果有人有关于此事的信息
But if anyone has information about this shameful act,

14:51.100 --> 14:52.600
告诉我
I demand to know.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.790
-走吧 穆多 -干吗?
Let's go, Menudo. Why?

15:03.800 --> 15:05.900
勒齐想找你 快走
Lechero wants you. Move your ass.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.690
每天我看你在院子里呆着
Now, every day I see you out in the yard,

15:09.700 --> 15:10.790
玩你的美国运动
you play your American sports

15:10.800 --> 15:12.090
穿着你的美国球衣
and wear your American clothes.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.090
我觉得从你来之后
I don't think I've heard you

15:13.100 --> 15:15.000
没你说过一句西班牙语
speak one word of Spanish since you've been here.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.000
我想练习英文
I like to practice my English.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.300
没什么不好
And why shouldn't you?

15:19.400 --> 15:20.800
美国是个伟大的国家
America is a great nation.

15:21.900 --> 15:25.190
"一个不可分割的国家 自由与公正属于所有人"
"One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."

15:25.200 --> 15:26.100
没错吧?
Is that right?

15:26.600 --> 15:27.390
对
Yes.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.500
没错
Yes.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.500
对所有人都要公平
Justice for all.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.200
你我都一样
Justice for you and justice for me.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.300
而对
And justice for

15:37.600 --> 15:39.700
那个在院子里杀了布朗齐多的凶手也要公平
whoever killed that blanquito in the yard.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.300
我知道你为什么在那一言不发
Now, I know why you didn't say anything out there.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.690
但你每天都在那玩恶心的美国游戏
But you play your silly American games all day long,

15:46.700 --> 15:49.200
就在尸体被发现的楼梯前面
right in front of the stairs where the body was found.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.500
现在 如果你不告诉我你看到了什么
Now, if you don't tell me what you saw,

15:55.200 --> 15:56.900
会有你好看的
there will be consequences.

16:02.700 --> 16:06.100
我 我看到一个人走进楼梯间
Well, I-I saw one person go into the stairwell.

16:08.500 --> 16:12.100
好像一分钟之后 我听到争吵声
A-And then maybe a minute later, I heard an argument.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.700
你看到谁了?
Who did you see?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.100
那么在我们松开绳子后
So after we tie the cord off

16:21.700 --> 16:23.590
我们切断栏杆 打通窗户
we dig out the bar, we pop open the grate,

16:23.600 --> 16:24.690
然后我们就逃出去 没错吧迈克?
and we're, and we're down, right, Michael?

16:24.700 --> 16:25.790
有人想说说
Does anyone want to say anything

16:25.800 --> 16:27.500
我们刚看到的东西吗?
about what we just saw out there?

16:29.000 --> 16:29.890
说什么?
What is there to say?

16:29.900 --> 16:31.290
首先 一小时前
Well, for starters, an hour ago,

16:31.300 --> 16:32.590
你说也许我们得杀个人
you say maybe we should kill someone

16:32.600 --> 16:33.690
然后就有人被杀了
and then someone gets killed.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.290
我没说过 而那
I didn't say that, and this is exactly

16:35.300 --> 16:36.590
就是我们现在必须关注的
what we should be focusing on right now.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.890
让我们花几个小时
Let's spend a couple of hours worrying

16:37.900 --> 16:40.200
担心在这鬼地方的另一具尸体
about another dead body in this hellhole.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.700
你们要干吗?
What do you want?

16:42.500 --> 16:43.400
你们要干吗?
What are you doing?

16:43.500 --> 16:44.690
勒齐想见你
Lechero wants to see you.

16:44.700 --> 16:45.990
我什么信息都没有
I don't have any information.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.400
他不需要信息
He doesn't want information.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.700
他需要招供
He wants a confession.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.600
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.000
他说的没错 他是无辜的
Listen to him; he's innocent.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.700
那你想招供?
You want to confess?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.400
那你来代替他啊
You can easily switch places.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.190
也许现在我们得开始担心
Maybe now we should start worrying

17:10.200 --> 17:11.900
那个真正的杀手了吧?
about who the real killer is, huh?

17:12.600 --> 17:14.590
是啊 但在这里
Yeah, but in this place,

17:14.600 --> 17:16.090
也许有一百个人在嫌疑名单上
there could be a hundred people on that list.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.790
除了我觉得在死者脖子底部
Except I'm thinking a single stab wound

17:17.800 --> 17:20.100
有个刀疤 而那伤口一看就是高手干的 阿历克斯
to the base of the neck looks pretty professional, Alex.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.690
我当时正有人探视 老兄
I was in visitation, Kojak.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.300
什么让你这么肯定惠斯勒没杀人?
And what makes you so sure that Whistler didn't do it?

17:24.300 --> 17:26.090
他可是与他有纠葛的人
He's the one that had the run-in with the guy.

17:26.100 --> 17:27.590
不可能 他不会为这事去冒险
No, he's got too much to lose.

17:27.600 --> 17:28.690
惠斯勒出局了 即使不是现在
Whistler's gone, and if not now,

17:28.700 --> 17:30.490
也快了 所以就剩我们俩
he probably will be soon, so it's you and me.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.800
没有所谓的我们俩
There's no you and me.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.500
我们不会丢下他逃走的
We're not leaving here without him.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.090
在两个小时内 我将要爬出窗户 翻过那围墙
In two hours, I'm going out that window and through that fence.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.890
是吗? 很好
Oh, yeah? Yeah, that's right.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.190
你想跑哪去 阿历克斯?
And where are you going to go to, Alex?

17:39.200 --> 17:40.290
哪都去不了
Anywhere but here.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.700
只有一条路能出去
There's only one road out,

17:41.900 --> 17:43.990
树林里有24小时不间断巡逻
and the jungle is under constant patrol by police 24-7,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.100
那我再问一次 你想跑哪去阿历克斯?
so, again, where are you going to go to, Alex?

17:46.100 --> 17:48.200
3点13分 我会离开的
3:13, I'm gone.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.000
我说过我对此一无所知
I told you I know nothing about this.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.600
我不应该
I shouldn't

17:57.900 --> 17:59.090
我不该被带这来
I shouldn't be here.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.700
我能向你保证 我没杀人
I can promise you I, I did not kill that man.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.500
有人看到你走下楼梯
Someone saw you go down the staircase.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.900
楼梯 还有什么证据吗?
Stai.. is there any other proof?

18:06.200 --> 18:07.500
我的人会找到证据的
My men will find something.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.200
那你看到我身上有凶器吗?
Well, do you see a weapon on me?

18:09.200 --> 18:11.090
我才不期望能在你身上看到凶器
I didn't expect to see a weapon on you.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.890
那他们怎么不去找那个?
Well, w-why don't they look for that?

18:12.900 --> 18:14.590
找到凶器 就找到了真正的杀手
You find that, you'll find the real killer.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.490
或者也许他们找到了你埋凶器的地方
Or maybe they find where you planted it.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.990
你是说我在栽赃?
So, what, I'm framing someone?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.190
那你想过
Well, did it ever occur to you

18:19.200 --> 18:21.590
也许有人在设计陷害我? 谁会这样做?
that someone might be framing me? Who would bother?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.690
你知道我被关在这的原因
You know the reason I'm here.

18:22.700 --> 18:23.890
你知道我有强大的敌人
You know I have powerful enemies.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.200
你认为我的判断会被市长的朋友左右吗?
You think my judgment is swayed by the mayor's friends?

18:26.400 --> 18:27.900
坐下吧
Sit your ass down.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.200
当我13岁时
When I was 13,

18:32.400 --> 18:34.500
我妈妈在一个有钱人家当仆人
my mother worked for a wealthy man as a maid

18:35.600 --> 18:36.900
直到有一天
until one day

18:38.500 --> 18:40.300
她一个人呆在房子里
she was alone in the house

18:42.200 --> 18:43.600
和他待在一起
with him and he

18:49.100 --> 18:50.700
所有人都知道他干了什么
Everybody knew what he did,

18:53.600 --> 18:55.300
但是由于他是富人
but because he was rich

18:55.600 --> 18:57.500
而我们是移民
and we were immigrants,

18:58.700 --> 19:00.800
警察连报案都不接受
the police wouldn't even take a report.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.400
然后 一周之后
So, a week later,

19:05.500 --> 19:07.500
为了接近他
to gain access through his gates,

19:08.500 --> 19:11.700
我装扮成送牛奶的——一个勒齐
I dressed as a milkman a Lechero

19:12.800 --> 19:16.300
我确保 他得到其应有的惩罚
and I made sure that fair punishment was rendered.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.900
现在你来说说我会怎么偏袒富人
Now you want to tell me how I favor the rich.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.500
我知道这里的规矩 我也尊重它
I understand the rules here, and I respect them.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.600
为什么这么急着下结论?
But why the rush to judgment?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.790
有哪个条款规定你必须在
Is there a rule saying you must convict a suspect

19:32.800 --> 19:34.000
10分钟内找到嫌疑犯吗
within ten minutes?

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
没有
No.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.100
我们有大把时间慢慢研究
We have all the time in the world.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.400
谢谢你
Thank you.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.700
当然 现在我哪也不会去
Now, obviously, I'm not going anywhere.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.900
如果你还想聊聊 我就在我的单间里
If you need to talk again, I'm gonna be in my cell.

19:53.000 --> 19:53.900
不用了
No.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.500
你只能坐在这把椅子上
You'll be right here in this chair.

20:12.650 --> 20:14.140
你到底想要做什么?
What the hell do you want?

20:14.150 --> 20:15.150
我不喜欢你
I don't like you.

20:16.150 --> 20:18.050
当然也没有尊重你
I certainly don't respect you.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.640
够了 你在伤害我的感觉
Stop. You're hurting my feelings.

20:19.650 --> 20:21.740
你也知道你能干什么
I've seen at you're capable of,

20:21.750 --> 20:22.950
但我不得不承认
but I got to say

20:22.950 --> 20:24.650
我从来没想过你会杀人
I never pegged you as a murderer.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.450
你认为是我杀了帝格?
You think I killed Tyge?

20:27.950 --> 20:31.540
我今早在院子里看见你们俩了
I saw the two of you in the courtyard this morning.

20:31.550 --> 20:32.840
我只是想跟他交朋友
I was trying to be Nice to him.

20:32.850 --> 20:33.940
是他先和我过不去的
He started with me.

20:33.950 --> 20:35.450
如果不是你杀的 那会是谁?
Well, if you didn't kill him, who did?

20:35.950 --> 20:36.650
不是我
Not me.

20:36.650 --> 20:37.850
别嘴硬了 布拉德
Come on, Brad.

20:38.350 --> 20:39.850
除了你以为谁还会想要他的小命?
Who wanted him dead besides you?

20:39.850 --> 20:41.450
你当真以为是我杀了那个呆瓜?
You really think I killed that frog?

20:41.750 --> 20:44.050
我拿着枪口对着你多少次了?
How many times have I had you at gunpoint?

20:44.350 --> 20:46.150
你以为我不想开枪?
You think I didn't want to pull that trigger?

20:50.350 --> 20:50.950
天啊
Hell

20:52.650 --> 20:54.450
我连自杀都没办法
I can't even kill myself.

21:04.550 --> 21:07.450
你知道有谁看见惠斯勒从这楼梯下去吗?
Hey, you seen anyone see Whistler go down the stairway?

21:07.750 --> 21:09.250
我们才出来1分钟
We only been out here a minute.

21:09.350 --> 21:10.540
那么快点了
Well, hurry up, then.

21:10.550 --> 21:11.950
惠斯勒死的越早
The sooner Whistler dies,

21:12.750 --> 21:14.650
那我就能越早给你鸡爪
the sooner I can give you the chicken foot,

21:14.850 --> 21:17.040
也许你更喜欢给我鸡爪
or if you prefer, you can give me the chicken foot

21:17.050 --> 21:19.150
像个男人一样试试
you know, try and go out like a man.

21:19.850 --> 21:22.550
随便选 你今天得和我决斗
Either way, you're getting in the ring with me today.

21:32.350 --> 21:35.650
Zylafol 用来麻醉狗的
Zylafol. It's used to anesthetize dogs.

21:35.650 --> 21:37.950
2滴 守卫就会在一个小时内昏迷
Two drops, and the guard should be out within an hour.

21:39.150 --> 21:41.250
我还以为惠斯勒的女朋友会参与行动
I was expecting Whistler's girlfriend to join you.

21:41.350 --> 21:43.040
她在哪 转角的车里?
Where is she? Around the corner in the car?

21:43.050 --> 21:44.150
她来找过我
She came to me.

21:44.550 --> 21:45.740
我不介意她帮助你
I don't mind that she's helping you.

21:45.750 --> 21:47.350
我介意的是你对我保密
I mind that you kept it from me.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.040
有什么关系呢
What difference does it make?

21:49.050 --> 21:50.140
我是说 我们明天就散伙了 对吧?
I mean, we're done by tomorrow, right?

21:50.150 --> 21:52.050
别再耍花样了林肯
No more surprises, Lincoln.

21:54.250 --> 21:55.250
干吗? 说出来
What? Say it.

21:55.650 --> 21:57.350
你能给我更多莎拉的照片吗?
Can you get any more pictures of Sara?

21:58.150 --> 21:59.950
活着的? 当然不
Alive? No.

22:03.050 --> 22:04.150
你没告诉他
You didn't tell him.

22:04.950 --> 22:07.050
你没告诉迈克 莎拉已经死了
You didn't tell Michael that Sara's dead.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.550
到底能不能弄出照片来?
Can we get pictures or not?

22:10.250 --> 22:11.940
当然我们可以拼张出来
I'm sure we can cobble something together,

22:11.950 --> 22:14.750
真聪明 你竟然没告诉你弟弟
but smart move not telling your brother.

22:14.850 --> 22:16.650
他似乎对我不怎么信任
He seems a little sensitive to me.

22:18.950 --> 22:21.040
这就是交换地点 LJ和我会那等待
This is the exchange point LJ and I will be waiting.

22:21.050 --> 22:22.640
你迈克和惠斯勒
You, Michael and Whistler will meet us there.

22:22.650 --> 22:25.850
一切顺利的话 你9点就能跟你儿子团聚了
Everything goes as planned, you'll have your son back by 9:00.

22:26.950 --> 22:27.550
林肯?
Lincoln?

22:28.650 --> 22:29.550
9点
9:00.

22:45.550 --> 22:46.750
是哪个?
Which one is it?

22:46.950 --> 22:48.240
不知道 我猜是高的那个
I don't know, I think it's the taller one.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.550
-另外个一直在喝橘子汁 -你确定吗?
The other one is always drinking orange juice. You sure?

22:50.550 --> 22:52.040
我想是的 不过不大肯定
I think so, I'm not completely sure,

22:52.050 --> 22:52.840
他们看起来都差不多
but they all look the same. Hey

22:53.550 --> 22:54.840
我们一直在找你
We've been trying to reach you.

22:54.850 --> 22:56.250
索纳里面又有一具尸体
There's another dead body in Sona.

22:56.350 --> 22:57.040
我是在
I was just

23:01.650 --> 23:03.150

You want a coffee?

23:03.250 --> 23:04.450
给我买杯果汁吧
Get me a juice.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.550
橘子汁
Orange juice.

23:09.350 --> 23:12.350
请给我一杯橘子汁和一杯咖啡
One orange juice and one coffee, please.

23:24.550 --> 23:25.650
走路看着点
Watch where you're going

23:25.750 --> 23:26.540

Here, look, uh

23:26.550 --> 23:28.140
这是我伙伴的 请拿去吧
this is a buddy's, please.

23:28.150 --> 23:29.450
不好意思 我坚持
Please, I insist.

23:30.350 --> 23:32.450
胡塔多队长 给你重新弄了杯咖啡
Captain Hurtado Here's a new coffee.

23:32.550 --> 23:33.040
不是的
No really.

23:33.050 --> 23:33.950
托马 托马

23:36.250 --> 23:37.050
谢谢
Gracias.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.750
伙计 我
Man, I

23:39.750 --> 23:40.650
还是谢谢了
Thank you anyway.

23:41.650 --> 23:42.240
不好意思 先生
Excuse me, Se?or.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.950
我想去索纳
I need to go to Sona.

23:44.050 --> 23:44.840
我
I

23:44.850 --> 23:46.640
-我的车没气了 -抱歉
my car's run out of gas and Sorry.

23:46.650 --> 23:48.940
我开的方向不对
I'm-I'm heading in the wrong, wrong direction.

23:48.950 --> 23:50.440
我真的得到索纳去
I really need to go to Sona.

23:50.450 --> 23:53.050
我可以载你一程
I'll give you a ride.

23:53.050 --> 23:54.350
来吧
Come along.

23:54.750 --> 23:55.450
谢谢你
Thank you.

23:59.450 --> 24:01.250
小心点 别穿帮了
Watch the lid.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.450
请接受我的哀悼
My condolences.

24:18.050 --> 24:20.540
你终于有了个朋友 但他现在又要挂了
You finally make a friend, and now he's about to die.

24:20.550 --> 24:21.650
真丢脸啊
Damn shame.

24:22.350 --> 24:23.750
你可以阻止的
You can stop it, you know.

24:24.750 --> 24:25.840
也许你还没注意到
If you hadn't noticed,

24:25.850 --> 24:28.550
我的位置能让我获得不少事情
my position enables me to hear things.

24:32.950 --> 24:33.750
我在听
I'm listening.

24:34.150 --> 24:35.840
勒齐所拥有的唯一证据
The only proof Lechero's got is

24:35.850 --> 24:37.740
就是你们下了那个楼梯 对吧
that your man went down that staircase, t?

24:37.750 --> 24:38.840
如果你有更有说服力的证据呢?
What if you had more compelling

24:38.850 --> 24:40.450
我没有
evidence? Well, I don't.

24:40.550 --> 24:41.650
但如果你有呢
But if you did

24:41.950 --> 24:43.440
你在建议我伪造点什么?
You're suggesting I make something up?

24:43.450 --> 24:45.240
如果它能让你良心过的去的话
If it makes your conscience feel better,

24:45.250 --> 24:46.740
然后嫁祸到某个应该得到惩罚的人的头上
then blame it on somebody who deserves it.

24:46.750 --> 24:47.840
某个曾经杀了人
Someone who's killed before

24:47.850 --> 24:48.740
但并未得到惩罚的凶手
and gone unpunished.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.050
对啊 比如你
Yeah, like you maybe.

24:51.550 --> 24:52.450
萨米
Sammy.

24:56.550 --> 24:57.740
你想要我告诉勒齐
You want me to tell Lechero

24:57.750 --> 24:59.450
他的左右手罪有应得?
that his right hand man should die?

25:00.250 --> 25:03.550
你不需要要求勒齐低头
You don't tell Lechero squat.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.140
勒齐知道
Lechero knows

25:05.150 --> 25:06.550
这是萨米的戒指
this is Sammy's ring.

25:07.250 --> 25:07.940
如果你把它丢到
If you drop it

25:07.950 --> 25:09.340
楼梯上的那摊血里
in the blood by the staircase,

25:09.350 --> 25:11.340
然后对勒齐大喊你的发现
then yell up to Lechero what you've found

25:11.350 --> 25:12.840
那这整个
the whole entire

25:12.850 --> 25:14.840
监狱都会听说有明确证据
prison will hear clear-cut evidence

25:14.850 --> 25:16.250
证明萨米有罪
of Sammy's guilt.

25:16.450 --> 25:19.650
勒齐除了遵守规定以外别无他法
Lechero will have no choice but to comply.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.950
这就是索纳
This is Sona.

25:28.150 --> 25:30.140
没啥好担心的
Don't worry your pretty little head about it.

25:30.150 --> 25:32.640
你只要把戒指放进血泊中
All you have to do is drop the ring in the blood

25:32.650 --> 25:34.040
说是萨米干的
and say it was Sammy.

25:34.050 --> 25:35.250
剩下的就交给我
I'll take care of the rest.

25:38.950 --> 25:40.850
想救你朋友的命么?
You want to save your friend's life?

25:41.650 --> 25:43.350
那有人就得死
Someone else has to die.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.600
跟帝格解释下为什么你不同意
Explain your disagreement with this Tyge man.

26:36.000 --> 26:36.890
我听说
From what I just heard,

26:36.900 --> 26:38.100
他知道你的一些事?
he knew something about you?

26:39.200 --> 26:40.800
他以为他知道我的一些事
He thought he knew something about me.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.390
时机和动机
Opportunity and a motive.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.500
这些可不妙啊
That's not a good combination.

26:43.600 --> 26:44.990
你也一定知道了
You must know there's discontent

26:45.000 --> 26:47.300
大家对你的管理心存不满
from many prisoners over how you run Sona.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.500
现在不是攻击我的时候
Now would not be a good time to insult me.

26:50.300 --> 26:54.490
你杀了我 得到了你要的正义
you execute me, you get your swift justice

26:54.500 --> 26:55.790
你或许可以安抚大家
and you may placate the masses.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.400
但当他们最终发现谁做的
But when they find out who really did it

26:58.000 --> 26:59.900
他们就会说 你杀了个无辜的人
they will know you killed an innocent man.

26:59.900 --> 27:01.600
你还没回答我的问题
You're still not answering my question.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.190
你和帝格到底怎么回事?
What was your disagreement with Tyge?

27:03.200 --> 27:03.990
他是个爱管闲事的人
He was a nosy guy.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.200
他来干涉我的事
He got into my business.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.190
我肯定他也去管了别人的闲事
I'm sure he did the same with someone else,

27:07.200 --> 27:08.400
所以被杀了
and that's what got him killed.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.290
那你是承认你和他有矛盾了?
Would you just admit that you had an argument?

27:10.300 --> 27:11.200
这里是监狱
This is prison.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.390
如果有人对我横加指责 我当然受不了
If someone makes false accusations, I can't back down.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.690
这点你应该清楚
You must respect that.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.600
我已经回答了你的每个问题
Look, I've answered every one of your questions.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.490
我已经尽全力澄清了
I've acquitted myself the best that I can.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.400
要怎样你才相信我
Now what can I do to make you trust me?

27:24.600 --> 27:25.700
这年头 我谁都不信
I don't trust anybody today.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.800
一定很多人对你说过 但我还是要说
You must get this a lot, but

27:33.100 --> 27:34.400
你真美
You're very pretty.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.700
非常非常美
I mean very, very pretty.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.600
怎么了?
What's the trouble?

28:08.100 --> 28:12.500
可能你不知道 不过
You probably don't know this, but

28:12.900 --> 28:14.700
有一种为特别的人
There is a special visitation

28:14.800 --> 28:16.400
准备的特殊探视
for special people

28:16.900 --> 28:19.700
我可以安排你进入索纳
I could arrange for you to go inside Sona

28:20.400 --> 28:24.200
和你的爱人享受点二人世界
and have some private time with your love.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.800
要想进去
And everything you would need

28:29.600 --> 28:31.100
你所要做的
to assure your entry

28:32.400 --> 28:33.700
都能在这辆车里完成
could be performed right here in this car.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
是啊
Yeah.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.100
照片到手了
We have the picture.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.500
看上去怎样
How does it look?

28:48.700 --> 28:50.100
很像莎拉
It looks like Sara.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.590
我半小时后到索纳
I'll be at Sona in half an hour.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.000
停车场等我
Meet me in the parking lot.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.000
没出什么岔子吧
Is everything okay?

28:56.200 --> 28:57.700
等下 等下 等下
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.900
难道你不爱你的男人?
Don't you love your man?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.090
我不知你是否知道 但是
I don't know if you know this, but

29:05.100 --> 29:07.700
诺曼脾气很暴躁
Norman has a terrible temper.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.700
诺曼? 诺曼·圣约翰?
Norman? Norman St. John?

29:11.100 --> 29:12.000
是
Si?

29:12.900 --> 29:14.590
你是勒齐的女人?
You're one of Lechero's girls?

29:14.600 --> 29:15.500
是
Si?

29:35.900 --> 29:37.300
我等着呢
I'm waiting.

29:37.700 --> 29:39.500
守卫这有点麻烦
There was a complication with the guard.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.300
给他下药有点麻烦?
Complications drugging the guard?

29:42.400 --> 29:43.900
是 不过还有希望
Yeah, but it's been taken care of.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.190
好 不错
Well, that's encouraging,

29:46.200 --> 29:47.490
你们现在下药干吗
but why are you drugging the guard

29:47.500 --> 29:49.200
不是晚上才行动么?
now when you're escaping tonight?

29:49.500 --> 29:50.790
要那么久才会有药物才会起效
Well, it takes that long for the drugs to work

29:50.800 --> 29:53.100
药物1小时候就起效 我告诉过你
They take an hour, like I told you.

30:00.800 --> 30:01.600
阿历克斯
Alex

30:31.090 --> 30:33.400
你的表现可越来越差了 阿历克斯
You are getting sloppy,Alex.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.340
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

30:37.110 --> 30:38.310
这是跟我开玩笑吗 -我很久以前就
Is this is a joke? I stopped hiding

30:38.490 --> 30:40.240
不再把东西藏在床底下了
things under my mattress a long time ago.

30:40.420 --> 30:41.250
你在我床下找到的?
Did you find that under my mattress?

30:41.400 --> 30:43.160
如果是的话 那也是别人故意放在那里的
Cause if you did somebody put it there.

30:43.620 --> 30:44.930
这么跟我解释可说不通
You're gonna have to do better than that.

30:45.090 --> 30:45.520
是吗
Really?

30:45.690 --> 30:46.630
你在刀上发现我的指纹了吗
Did you find some fingerprints on it?

30:46.790 --> 30:47.700
啊? 还是你发现一些我的纤维了
Huh? Did you get some fibers?

30:47.870 --> 30:49.920
你打算怎么做? 把它交给索纳的鉴证室检验一下?
What are you gonna do take it to the Sona crime lab?

30:50.090 --> 30:50.710
他们认定是惠斯勒
They got Whistler nailed

30:50.860 --> 30:52.130
就因为他在错误的时间去过这个楼道
for walking into the wrong stairwell.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.140
我想凭这个
I'm thinking this is enough

30:53.150 --> 30:54.640
就足够可以让你们俩换个处境了
to get you guys to switch places.

30:54.650 --> 30:55.650
明白我的意思么?
You know what I mean?

30:55.850 --> 30:57.340
什么意思? 这又能证明什么呢?
What does that mean, huh? What does that prove?

30:57.350 --> 30:58.250
证明了一切
It proves everything

30:58.250 --> 31:00.250
我确定勒齐也一定这么想
I'm gonna make sure Lechero thinks so, too.

31:00.250 --> 31:00.950
迈克
Michael.

31:01.850 --> 31:03.540
迈克我没杀他
Michael, I did not kill that man.

31:03.550 --> 31:05.450
我没杀他
I did not kill the man.

31:13.650 --> 31:14.850
怎么了?
What's, what's going on?

31:15.950 --> 31:16.950
没事吧?
Is everything okay?

31:19.950 --> 31:21.150
你想干吗?
What the hell you doing?

31:22.950 --> 31:23.740
这是为什么?
What's that for?

31:23.750 --> 31:25.850
你爸爸想逞英雄
Your father tried to be a hero.

31:26.750 --> 31:27.650
不 不
No, no.

31:27.750 --> 31:29.340
求你了 求你了
Hey, please, please.

31:29.350 --> 31:30.050
求你了
Please.

31:30.150 --> 31:33.240
求你了 不 停下 停下
Please, no, stop Stop

31:33.250 --> 31:35.340
等我切断你的脊髓 再弄断几根末梢神经
Once I cut the spinal cord and the sever nerve endings,

31:35.350 --> 31:36.340
你就什么都感觉不到了
you won't feel a thing.

31:36.350 --> 31:37.040
不 不
No, no.

31:37.050 --> 31:39.050
不 不
No, no

31:45.150 --> 31:46.440
苏珊对不起
Susan, I'm sorry.

31:46.450 --> 31:47.850
我们不是故意的
We didn't mean to do that.

31:48.150 --> 31:49.950
爸爸 他们要杀我
Dad, they're gonna kill me.

31:50.050 --> 31:51.350
什么 LJ?
What? LJ?

31:51.350 --> 31:53.250
他们要割断我的喉咙
Yeah, they got a knife to my throat.

31:53.450 --> 31:54.250
LJ
LJ

31:54.850 --> 31:55.840
-苏珊你敢 -爸爸
Susan, don't you hurt Dad

31:55.850 --> 31:57.050
说真话
The truth.

31:57.450 --> 31:58.150
真话
Truth.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.340
迈克他们3:13会出来
Michael's getting out at 3:13.

32:03.350 --> 32:05.550
我们3:45在碰头地点会合
We're meeting at the exchange point at 3:45.

32:05.650 --> 32:06.840
苏珊求你了 我们这么做
Susan, please, we did this

32:06.850 --> 32:09.250
只是为了确保安全
because we wanted to make sure the site was safe.

32:09.350 --> 32:11.450
仅此而已 这就是唯一的原因
That's it, that's the only reason why we did it.

32:11.450 --> 32:13.640
似乎你们在耍诡计啊
Sounds to me like you're planning another end round.

32:13.650 --> 32:14.850
再一次营救计划
Another rescue.

32:14.850 --> 32:15.850
不 不
No, no.

32:15.950 --> 32:17.950
不是的 我们没有
We're not, we're not planning,

32:18.050 --> 32:19.750
没耍诡计
re not planning another end round.

32:20.050 --> 32:22.150
不 求你 只是
No. Please, just

32:22.250 --> 32:23.150
放我儿子一马
let my son go.

32:23.350 --> 32:24.150
放了他
Leave my son.

32:48.150 --> 32:49.450
活的不错?
Living the good life, huh?

32:51.150 --> 32:52.250
不是吧
Is that what this is?

32:53.150 --> 32:54.340
过的太滋润了
Having too good a time here

32:54.350 --> 32:55.950
都不想离开了?
to contemplate leaving?

32:58.350 --> 33:00.150
我需要点时间想想
I needed some time to think.

33:00.350 --> 33:01.740
我也需要点时间
Well, I needed some time

33:01.750 --> 33:03.840
来和巴拿马人敲定协议
to finalize our agreement with the Panamanians,

33:03.850 --> 33:05.740
但我被人拉来了这里
but instead I get dragged down here.

33:05.750 --> 33:06.840
是 我知道 好不容易
Yeah, I'm sure it was really hard

33:06.850 --> 33:08.350
才说服你到这来
to convince you to come down here.

33:10.650 --> 33:11.850
实话实说
I'm gonna be honest.

33:13.050 --> 33:14.240
我是希望看到你这个样子
I was looking forward to seeing you

33:14.250 --> 33:19.150
不过现在来了 我倒不这么想了
down here like this, but now i that i am here, i wouldn't wish this on anymore.

33:22.450 --> 33:24.340
这些事能否稍后再谈
Can we just save all this till after

33:24.350 --> 33:25.240
我不知道
I don't know if we can or not.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.950
想好了么 阿历克斯?
Made up your mind yet, Alex?

33:27.050 --> 33:28.850
8年 最低监禁安全级别
Eight years, minimum security.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.350
我让他们减到4年
I got'em down to four.

33:31.250 --> 33:32.840
今晚就去美国?
And I leave for the US tonight?

33:32.850 --> 33:33.440
一旦
Once the special

33:33.450 --> 33:34.840
特别检查官确认你的事
prosecutor clears you,

33:34.850 --> 33:35.440
你就可以上路了
you'll be on your way.

33:37.350 --> 33:38.540
特别检察官是干嘛的
What about a special prosecutor?

33:38.550 --> 33:39.940
就是你站在人们面前
You stand in front of a guy,

33:39.950 --> 33:41.940
告诉检察官你的经历 由他决定
you, you tell your story and he determines

33:41.950 --> 33:44.040
当然如果你决定做证人
if you're gonna be a useful and credible witness.

33:44.050 --> 33:45.150
那些就只是些形式了
It's a formality.

33:45.850 --> 33:46.850
只是些形式?
"It's a formality"?

33:47.550 --> 33:48.850
就只是形式?
This is just a formality?

33:48.850 --> 33:50.750
小子 如果换作是我
You know, if it were up to me,

33:51.350 --> 33:52.850
你下半辈子就等着把牢底坐穿吧
you could rot in here for the rest of your life.

33:54.150 --> 33:55.240
但是司法部
But the Justice Department

33:55.250 --> 33:57.750
下了很大的决心
is extremely motivated to get to the bottom

33:57.950 --> 33:59.850
把罗纳德总统的案子一查到底
of this President Reynolds business.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.950
阿历克斯这绝对是个好出路
Alex, this is a hundred percent above board.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.950
你的职业生涯犯错太多
You've made a lot of mistakes in your career.

34:05.150 --> 34:06.340
你清楚 我也清楚
You know it and I know it,

34:06.350 --> 34:07.840
不管是不是故意的
intentional or otherwise.

34:07.850 --> 34:11.350
我桌上已经摞了8个对你的举报
I've got eight files in my office attesting to that.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.850
如果你不接受这些条件
And if you don't take this offer,

34:14.250 --> 34:15.840
我敢肯定
then I assure you it would be

34:15.850 --> 34:17.350
你一定会后悔的
the biggest mistake of your life.

34:25.750 --> 34:26.640
我知道是谁杀的
I know who killed that man.

34:26.650 --> 34:27.550
你当然知道了
I'm sure you do.

34:27.550 --> 34:28.350
勒齐
Lechero

34:34.150 --> 34:35.150
我们找到了什么
What do we have here?

34:35.250 --> 34:36.250
我找到这个
I found this

34:36.850 --> 34:38.550
在阿历克斯山德罗 马宏的号子里
in Alexander Mahone's cell.

34:58.750 --> 34:59.750
你可想得真周到
Convenient

34:59.850 --> 35:02.150
把责任都推到一个明显不再能回答问题的人身上
To blame this on a man who can't even be questioned.

35:03.650 --> 35:05.450
够了 乔
Enough of this already. Cheo

35:08.350 --> 35:09.450
把人都叫来
Get the prison up.

35:10.050 --> 35:11.150
现在
this time

35:25.650 --> 35:27.040
你知道不是惠斯勒干的
You kno Whistler didn't do this.

35:27.050 --> 35:29.150
他说了他在马宏号子里找到匕首了啊
He just said he found the shank in Mahone's cell?

35:29.150 --> 35:30.240
还不能证明我是清白的?
Doesn't that prove I'm innocent?

35:30.250 --> 35:31.050
你就会扯蛋
You're a joke

35:32.050 --> 35:32.940
你口口声声公平
You talk about equality.

35:32.950 --> 35:34.440
公正 但归根结底
You talk justice, but at the end of the day

35:34.450 --> 35:36.640
你不过就是一个独裁者 跟别的独裁者一样
you're a dictator, and just like any dictator

35:36.650 --> 35:38.340
你害怕失去权力
you're terrified of losing your power.

35:38.350 --> 35:40.440
别再考验我的耐心了 小子
It'd be very unwise to go any further.

35:40.450 --> 35:41.840
你并不关心真正的杀人犯是谁
You don't care who the real killer is

35:41.850 --> 35:43.640
随便抓个人就行了
just as long as you get to string somebody up.

35:43.650 --> 35:45.340
这对你来说就完事了 对不对
That's all that matters to you, isn't it?

35:45.350 --> 35:48.240
谁有罪 我说了算 而有罪的 都要死
I've determined who's guilty, and the punishment is death.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.840
你错了 这是谋杀
You're making a mistake. This is murder

35:49.850 --> 35:51.250
你清楚 我也清楚
You know it and I know it

35:51.450 --> 35:52.840
至少你得有胆量承认
At least have the guts to admit it

35:52.850 --> 35:53.650
没错
You're right

35:54.850 --> 35:55.550
是谋杀
It's murder.

35:59.550 --> 36:00.250
不要
Don't

36:16.450 --> 36:17.650
我在院子里发现这个
I found this in the yard

36:21.450 --> 36:23.650
这是原来奥古斯特上供给我的
Augusto used to give them to me as tribute.

36:24.150 --> 36:25.750
现在你玷污了它
And now you reek of them.

36:37.650 --> 36:38.450
滚吧
Go.

37:12.050 --> 37:12.950
有什么事吗
Everything okay?

37:13.550 --> 37:14.850
很惨吧
It's sad

37:16.150 --> 37:17.950
走错一步 就得让个陌生人
one wrong move and a stranger

37:17.950 --> 37:19.950
来给你下葬了
is throwing dirt on top of you.

37:39.450 --> 37:40.450
他会没事的
He will be okay.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.350
你怀疑你是不是真的爱自己的儿子
I question your love for your son.

38:01.150 --> 38:03.650
他差一点就被我砍头了
He was two seconds away from being decapitated

38:04.250 --> 38:05.150
就因为你
because of you.

38:05.550 --> 38:06.450
我跟你说的都是实话
I told you the truth.

38:07.050 --> 38:07.850
也许吧
Maybe.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.640
如果你还有什么小想法
But if you have anything else planned,

38:09.650 --> 38:10.750
趁早放弃
now it's scrapped.

38:10.950 --> 38:13.250
因为 你知道那意味着什么
Because, what happens if you try something?

38:14.850 --> 38:15.550
我知道
I know.

38:15.650 --> 38:16.450
知道就好
Oh, good.

38:24.350 --> 38:26.540
这报纸与上张照片里的是一样的
This is the same newspaper she was holding in the last picture.

38:26.550 --> 38:28.040
我的人只能拿到这个
That's what my guy could get.

38:28.050 --> 38:29.240
你给我的时间太有限了
You didn't give me a lot of time.

38:29.250 --> 38:31.150
你以为迈克察觉不出?
You think Michael's not going to notice this?

38:31.150 --> 38:34.250
那还能怎么样"迈克就就是照片"
Yeah."Hey, Michael, here's the pictures."

38:34.350 --> 38:36.050
他会仔细看照片的
He's going to want to see this close up.

38:36.250 --> 38:37.950
我已经帮你帮到头了
I'm done doing favors for you.

38:38.050 --> 38:38.950
滚出去
Get out.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.250
一小时后见
I'll see you in an hour.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.050
今天没足球赛?
No football today?

39:08.550 --> 39:10.050
没有
No, no football today.

39:15.350 --> 39:16.650
我们是好兄弟吧 萨米?
You're my brother, Sammy?

39:20.150 --> 39:21.050
那当然
Of course.

39:43.450 --> 39:44.150
好了?
It's done?

39:44.750 --> 39:46.250
警卫半小时内就会睡着
The guard will be asleep in a half hour.

39:46.350 --> 39:47.250
太好了
So we're good.

39:48.150 --> 39:48.950
还有点问题
Not quite.

39:50.450 --> 39:52.950
他们 呃 知道了我们下午要越狱
They, uh, they know we're breaking out this afternoon.

39:56.550 --> 39:57.350
你告诉她了?
You told her?

39:58.050 --> 39:58.940
她猜到了
Man, she worked it out

39:58.950 --> 40:00.850
-你撒个谎不就得了? -她猜出来了
Why didn't you lie? She worked out.

40:00.950 --> 40:03.150
那我们现在怎么才能占到上风呢 林肯?
So what are we gonna do to get the upper hand here, Linc?

40:03.850 --> 40:05.240
-没事 -你以为他们会给我们
Nothing. You think they're just going to turn over

40:05.250 --> 40:07.140
-LJ和莎拉? -太冒险了
LJ and Sara? This is too dangerous.

40:07.150 --> 40:08.440
如果我们试图救他们 他们就会
If we try anything, they're just going to

40:08.450 --> 40:09.550
就会怎么样? 伤害他们?
What, hurt them?

40:11.650 --> 40:14.050
不会的 只要没得到惠斯勒他们就不会乱来
No, not if they want us to deliver on Whistler, they won't.

40:15.050 --> 40:16.250
我们直接了当点吧
We're playing this one straight.

40:16.350 --> 40:18.040
不耍他们 不出奇兵
No games. No surprises.

40:18.050 --> 40:18.750
行么
All right?

40:20.950 --> 40:22.150
给我看看照片
Show me the pictures.

40:25.950 --> 40:27.550
给我看看照片 林肯
Show me the pictures, Linc.

40:27.950 --> 40:28.750
快点
Come on

40:30.250 --> 40:31.250
照片
The pictures.

40:31.550 --> 40:33.050
我不能给你看
I can't show you the pictures, man.

40:37.950 --> 40:39.050
为什么
Why not, Linc?

40:47.850 --> 40:49.150
她死了 迈克
She's dead, Michael.

40:54.650 --> 40:55.650
我撒谎了
I lied to you.

40:55.950 --> 40:56.950
对不起
I'm sorry.

40:58.850 --> 41:00.850
如果你今天不越狱 他们会杀掉我儿子
If you don't break out today, they're going to kill my son.

41:01.950 --> 41:03.250
他们真的会杀掉LJ
They're going to kill LJ.

41:04.950 --> 41:06.250
迈克我们必须得干
Michael, we've got to do this.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.650
迈克我们必须得干
Michael, we've got to do this

41:09.450 --> 41:10.250
迈克
Michael

42:18.650 --> 42:19.750
莎拉死了
Sara's dead.

42:23.150 --> 42:24.250
他们杀了莎拉
They killed her.

42:27.950 --> 42:29.050
真遗憾 兄弟
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

42:32.650 --> 42:35.950
我爱她 现在她就这么去了
I loved her and now she's gone.

42:38.150 --> 42:39.650
全是因为你
And it's all because of you.

42:40.850 --> 42:41.550
