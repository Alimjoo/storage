我没有杀他 迈克尔

00:04.390 --> 00:06.140
如果你没有杀特伦斯 斯蒂德曼
If you didn't kill Terrence Steadman,

00:07.100 --> 00:09.010
究竟是谁要陷害你?
how the hell did someone make it look like you did?

00:09.550 --> 00:10.360
我会救你出去的
I'm getting you out of here.

00:10.360 --> 00:13.240
不可能   除非监狱是你设计的
That's impossible. Not if you designed the place,it isn't.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.580
最好是开着的
Better be open,bro.

00:35.580 --> 00:37.320
你要我触犯法律
You're asking me to break the law.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.780
我只是让你犯个小错误
I'm asking you to make a mistake

00:38.780 --> 00:39.730
忘记锁门就行了
forget to lock up.

00:41.790 --> 00:42.630
我们进去了
We're in.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.150
谁杀了特伦斯 斯蒂德曼?
Who killed Terrence Steadman?

00:51.150 --> 00:52.220
没人

00:52.220 --> 00:54.020
特伦斯 斯蒂德曼还活着

00:54.020 --> 00:55.420
你好  特伦斯
Hello,Terrence.

00:55.420 --> 00:56.670
快拉警报
Sound the alarm!

01:06.400 --> 01:07.230
发生什么事了?
What's going on?

01:19.970 --> 01:22.200
不! 不要!
No! No!

01:22.780 --> 01:23.740
我们现在怎么办?
What do we do now?

01:23.740 --> 01:24.750
跑
We run

01:33.240 --> 01:34.870
那些逃犯是谁?
The escapees,who were they?

01:34.880 --> 01:36.470

Got a list right here.

他们越狱多久了?

02:49.390 --> 02:50.290
昨晚八点逃跑的
8:00 last night

02:51.520 --> 02:53.450
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯是亲兄弟
Scofield-- he and Burrows were brothers.

02:53.930 --> 02:54.620
没错
That's right.

02:56.730 --> 02:58.430
斯科菲尔德就是整个越狱计划的主谋
And he's the mastermin of this whole thing

02:59.170 --> 02:59.980
他们是这么说的
That's what they're saying

03:01.650 --> 03:03.070
我要有关他的所有信息
I want everything they've got on him.

03:40.040 --> 03:40.820
他们在哪里?
Where are they?

03:42.980 --> 03:43.840
什么声音?
What the hell is that?

03:51.480 --> 03:52.180
我们走
Let's go.

03:57.340 --> 03:59.430
我们必须想办法到对面去    你说什么？
All we got to do is make it to the other side. What?

03:59.430 --> 04:01.010
想法子到对面去
Make it to the other side.

04:04.930 --> 04:06.330
快点 跑起来
Come on,guys

04:14.680 --> 04:15.900
再快点
Pick it up

04:17.490 --> 04:19.220
火车加速了!
The thing is gaining speed,man!

04:23.030 --> 04:24.220
太快了!
It's going too fast!

04:24.220 --> 04:24.860
穿过去!
Go through

04:25.190 --> 04:26.160
什么?  穿过去!
What?  Go through!

04:29.610 --> 04:30.770
快!
Go!

04:43.400 --> 04:44.350
站住!别动!
Freeze!

04:44.360 --> 04:47.090
斯科菲尔德  我会开枪的
I will gun you down,Scofield!

05:06.090 --> 05:07.240
直升机还有其他人在哪?
Where's the aerial and the others?

05:07.250 --> 05:08.490
他们返回加油了
They're back on the ground refueling.

05:11.390 --> 05:12.440
这帮畜生
Son of a bitch.

05:48.200 --> 05:48.970
先生
Sir

05:49.700 --> 05:50.480
记者们都到场了
Media's ready.

06:21.770 --> 06:27.900
我想谈一下谋杀林肯总统的凶犯 约翰 威尔克斯 布斯
I'd like to,uh,talk about John Wilkes Booth for a moment if I could,Abraham Lincoln's killer

06:28.720 --> 06:32.010
总共费时12天把他抓捕归案
12 days,that's how long it took to find him.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.610
他在逃期间的日记中写道
In his journal during this period,he wrote

06:34.610 --> 06:37.930
影子左右为伴 夜幕我来主宰
that the shadow was his friend,the night his domain.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.470
他承认不管犯罪时的精神状态如何
He acknowledged that whatever neuroses drove the criminal

06:42.470 --> 06:51.580
精神问题会由于逃跑和追捕进一步恶化
to commit the original crime is compounded,magnified by flight,by the sounds of dogs at his heels.

06:52.770 --> 06:53.930
恐惧变成了妄想
Fear becomes paranoia,

06:55.430 --> 06:57.180
妄想最终变为精神错乱
paranoia ultimately psychosis.

06:59.310 --> 07:02.670
我在这里提这件事是因为
I bring this up,because,in 140 years,

07:02.670 --> 07:06.380
140年以来 逃犯的基本心理没有改变过
the fundamental mind of the escaped man has not changed.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.490
逃犯也是人
The escaped man is still human.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.960
他们也会害怕
He is still afraid,

07:11.400 --> 07:14.380
他们不惜一切要逃脱追捕
and he will stop at nothing in his attempt at flight.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.460
所幸的是
Fortunately for us

07:18.240 --> 07:23.050
尽管我们的追捕尚未有突破 夜色也站在他们一边
while our quarry has shadow and night as his ally

07:24.060 --> 07:28.560
我们还有样更厉害的法宝:电视
we have something far greater: television.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.450
我想动员所有正在收看节目的人
I would encourage everyone who is watching,

07:33.450 --> 07:34.390
这个国家的每个人
everyone in this country

07:35.150 --> 07:36.520
好好看看这些脸
to take a good look at these faces.

07:37.350 --> 07:38.610
就是这些人
These men right here

07:39.100 --> 07:41.320
现在是美国头八号通缉犯
are now the eight-most-wanted men in America.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.140
我以为我们都计划好了
I thought I thought this out.

07:51.150 --> 07:52.590
怎么会被他们追得这么惨?
You saw all those guys back there?

07:52.600 --> 07:53.690
关键就是他们只能在后面追
The key is they're back there,

07:54.320 --> 07:55.180
而我们快他们一步
and we're up here.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.210
这个样子还要持续多久?
Yeah,and how long is that going to last?

07:57.210 --> 07:59.220
特别是我们连小便都要憋着
Yeah,especially since we don't have a pot to piss in

07:59.230 --> 08:01.690
这都要归功于阿布鲁奇神奇消失的飞机
thanks to Abruzzi's magically disappearing jet.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.850
反正你本来就上不了那架飞机
Hey,you were never going to be on that plane,brother.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.760
不要以为我不知道你要去哪 斯科菲尔德
And don't think I don't know where you were going either,Scofield.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.730
我要去哪?
Where am I going?

08:06.730 --> 08:07.660
我不知道
Oh,I don't know.

08:08.110 --> 08:08.820
犹他州?
Utah?

08:11.110 --> 08:12.850
你打算何时给我们说说钱的事情?
When were you planning on telling us about the money,man?

08:13.250 --> 08:13.960
什么钱?
What money?

08:15.240 --> 08:17.490
韦斯特莫兰德藏的500万美元
$5 million that Westmoreland planted

08:17.490 --> 08:19.000
在犹他州的沙漠里
in the desert in Utah.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.140
不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

08:22.150 --> 08:23.890
是你希望我不知道吧
You wish I didn't know.

08:24.610 --> 08:25.520
等等 等等 什么钱?
Wait,wait. What money?

08:29.370 --> 08:29.940
狱长?
Warden?

08:31.670 --> 08:34.430
FBI介入得早了些 你认为呢?
It's a little early for the FBI to be showing up,don't you think?

08:35.070 --> 08:35.720
听着 我明白
Look,I get it.

08:36.220 --> 08:37.480
现在还是由你主导调查
It's still your investigation,

08:37.490 --> 08:39.120
但是一旦逃犯越过州界线
but once those criminals cross state lines,

08:39.120 --> 08:40.330
那就由联邦政府来处理了
it'll become a federal matter.

08:40.330 --> 08:42.080
没错  不会出现这种情况的
Yeah,well,that is not going to happen.

08:42.080 --> 08:42.830
但愿你是对的
I hope you're right.

08:43.570 --> 08:45.070
那就是为什么我提议
That's why I was going to suggest that we cut

08:45.080 --> 08:47.740
不要让部门间的政策碍手碍脚
through any interagency politics from the outset.

08:47.750 --> 08:48.660
完全透明
Full transparency.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.140
那当然
Absolutely.

08:50.140 --> 08:51.030
很好
Good.

08:52.310 --> 08:54.270
或许你能和我说说有关唐克雷蒂医生的事
Then maybe you can tell me about Dr. Tancredi.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.620
没什么好说的
There's nothing to tell.

08:57.980 --> 09:00.480
从我掌握的情况来看 她或许也参与了这次逃跑计划
From what I'm hearing,she may have abetted the escapees

09:01.160 --> 09:03.120
门不上锁 默许他们跑出去
opened the door that allowed them to get out.

09:04.030 --> 09:05.450
正如我刚才所说的 没什么好说的
Like I said,there's nothing to tell.

09:06.350 --> 09:07.840
你可不太不透明 狱长
You're not being very transparent,Warden.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.200
听着 我不想讨论我的手下
Look,I don't discuss my staff.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.030
或许你应该这么做
Maybe you should,

09:11.770 --> 09:13.380
因为她可能是整个事情的关键
because she may be the key to this thing.

09:15.150 --> 09:16.620
我们需要和她谈谈
We need to speak with her.

09:18.610 --> 09:19.800
就是现在 马宏先生
Right now. Mr. Mahone,

09:20.360 --> 09:22.040
她现在不想和任何人说话
she's not going to be speaking with anyone.

09:30.780 --> 09:31.420
情况怎么样?
How are we doing?

09:32.120 --> 09:33.340
她现在正在输液
Well,the IVs are hydrating her.

09:34.550 --> 09:37.290
我们给她注射了解毒剂 每小时半毫克
We got her on a naloxone infusion,half milligram per hour.

09:38.470 --> 09:39.570
你觉得存活下来的几率多大?
What do you think the chances are?

09:40.980 --> 09:42.000
我们已经尽力了
Well,we've done everything on our end.

09:42.000 --> 09:42.970
现在完全取决于她自身了
It's really up to her.

09:44.210 --> 09:48.060
求生意志强就可以活下去
Either she fights and lives,or she quits and dies.

10:39.810 --> 10:40.830
你想干什么...
Hey! What do you think...

10:46.440 --> 10:48.070
你要什么就拿去
Do whatever thing you got to do,man.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.370
孩子... 如果你敢报警
boy... you call the cops,

10:59.380 --> 11:04.130
我就把这个戳进你的眼睛
I will put this thing right here......in your eye.

11:09.310 --> 11:10.060
谢谢
Thank you.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.500
建筑工程师?
Structural engineer,huh?

11:30.500 --> 11:32.450
和平常的不一样 这么多纹身
Not the kind, you'd expect to get that much ink.

11:33.330 --> 11:34.100
绝对与众不同
Not the kind at all.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.880
你觉得要纹成这样需要花多久?
How long do you think it'd take to get something like that?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.850
几百小时吧... 200小时
Hundred hours... 200.

11:41.570 --> 11:44.460
给他纹身的刺青师 一定和他接触时间很久
Tattoo artist who gave it to him must have spent a lot of time on him then.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.300
我去把这个人找出来
I'll find out who it was.

11:51.610 --> 11:52.160
贝利克先生
Mr. Bellick.

11:52.160 --> 11:52.970
不要和我说话
Don't talk to me.

11:53.460 --> 11:55.360
没问题 但这样不好合作
Fine,but it's going to make collaboration kind of hard.

11:55.940 --> 11:56.730
合作？
Collaboration?

11:57.350 --> 12:00.580
我带队冒着艰险搜寻 而你在开新闻发布会
I got men out here in harm's way, and you're giving press conferences.

12:01.350 --> 12:02.270
媒体不过是种工具
The press is a tool.

12:02.910 --> 12:04.950
我会比你更快把逃犯抓回来
I'll bring those men back quicker than bloodhounds will.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.060
我们不需要你
We don't need you.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.950
我们紧跟逃犯遗留的线索
We're hot on these guys' trail,

12:07.960 --> 12:09.510
追踪到他们不过是时间问题
and it's just a matter of time till we nail them.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.650
追踪遗留线索的最大问题是
The problem I find with being on a trail

12:11.660 --> 12:15.020
你们总是晚他们一步
is that by definition you'll always be behind your prey.

12:17.790 --> 12:18.860
等着瞧吧
We'll see about that.

12:27.190 --> 12:28.260
我没有武器
I'm not armed.

12:28.620 --> 12:29.380
你必须要原谅我
You'll have to excuse me

12:29.390 --> 12:31.350
在这个当口上  我不太信任人
if I'm a little short on trust at the moment.

12:31.770 --> 12:33.360
小姐 我向你保证
I assure you,young woman,

12:33.370 --> 12:35.640
我是最不具威胁的人物
I'm the furthest thing from a threat.

12:35.650 --> 12:38.230
我想我用止痛剂已经能证明这点了
I think the Percocet pretty much ensures that.

12:38.620 --> 12:42.110
很好 那么你不会介意我拍张照
Good,then you won't mind if I capture this moment

12:42.110 --> 12:43.060
为了子孙后代
for posterity.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.760
这么做对你没有任何好处
Won't do you any good.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.220
你对有人因为谋杀你而马上要被执行死刑 无动于衷
You don't care that someone's going to be executed for your murder

12:48.220 --> 12:49.010
依然端坐于此
while you're just sitting here.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.770
我不是那个挑选林肯 布伦斯 作为替死鬼的人
I'm not the one choose Lincoln Burrows as the fall guy.

12:51.800 --> 12:55.050
那是谁干的? 你那个总统妹妹?
Who did? Your sister,the president?

12:55.070 --> 12:56.380
你不会明白的
You don't understand.

12:56.390 --> 12:57.870
对于这一切 我就是个囚犯
I'm a prisoner to all of this.

12:57.870 --> 12:58.580
算了吧
Oh,come on.

12:58.580 --> 12:59.870
你可以站出来
You could have come forward.

13:00.350 --> 13:02.340
你甚至可以在事情发生之前就出手阻止它
You could have stopped this thing before it even got started.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.740
不 我真的被囚禁了
No,I really am a prisoner.

13:05.630 --> 13:06.810
现在你也是了
And now,you are,too.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.300
从你关上门那一刻开始
The moment you let that door shut behind you.

13:19.710 --> 13:21.350
你有没有感到惊讶过
Didn't it strike you as curious

13:22.400 --> 13:24.190
为什么外面一个保安都没有
that there wasn't any security out there?

13:24.190 --> 13:26.210
这扇门只能从外面打开
The doors only open from the outside.

13:27.070 --> 13:29.670
玻璃有两英寸这么厚 还是防弹的
The glass is two inches thick,bulletproof.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.740
进了这里就出不去了
There's no getting out of here,young woman.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.270
我们现在必须甩掉他们
We got to dump them now.

13:41.990 --> 13:42.790
不行
Can't.

13:43.610 --> 13:44.580
他们知道犹他的事情了
They know about Utah.

13:45.420 --> 13:46.700
更重要的原因是
All the more reason to dump them.

13:47.120 --> 13:47.720
一旦他们被抓
If they get caught,

13:47.730 --> 13:49.460
他们定会招供我们的去向
they feds will know exactly where we're going.

13:49.460 --> 13:50.250
我们去告诉他们
We'll tell them.

13:50.790 --> 13:52.400
我们需要保证他们别惹事
We just got to make sure they stay afloat

13:52.410 --> 13:55.730
等我们到了犹他州就分道扬镳
until we're off in Utah,doing what we got to do.

13:58.050 --> 13:59.540
你真的认为钱会藏在那儿?
You really think the money's going to be there?

14:02.210 --> 14:04.120
查尔斯平时可能真话不多
Charles might have had a flexible relationship

14:04.130 --> 14:09.260
但人之将死... 他没有理由再撒谎了
with the truth,but at the end...at the end,there'd be no reason for him to lie about it.

14:10.030 --> 14:12.520
我计划一旦拿到钱 就逃到墨西哥
I figure once we bag it,we cross over into Mexico,

14:13.150 --> 14:15.060
然后搭乘颠簸的破烂巴士
take a whole bunch of bumpy second-class bus rides

14:15.080 --> 14:16.210
直到我们抵达巴拿马
till we hit Panama.

14:17.670 --> 14:20.650
你还真计划了开潜水店的事情了?
You really got a fix on this dive shop thing,huh?

14:22.490 --> 14:24.420
目前来说 在接下去的10或20年中
Right now,I wouldn't mind swinging in a hammock

14:24.420 --> 14:25.820
有吊床睡就不错了
for the next ten or 20 years.

14:26.770 --> 14:28.130
全国上下都在搜捕我们
We got half the country after us.

14:28.140 --> 14:29.950
如果没有帮助的话
We ain't making it to Panama or Utah.

14:30.450 --> 14:31.240
我们去不了巴拿马或犹他州
Not without help.

14:33.610 --> 14:34.870
维罗妮卡帮不了我们
Veronica can't help us.

14:35.640 --> 14:36.410
你怎么能这么说?
How can you say that?

14:36.870 --> 14:38.210
我们没有钱 衣服...
We don't have money,clothes...

14:38.210 --> 14:39.610
我早就安排好一切了
I already got all that.

14:40.860 --> 14:43.970
我还以为整个计划就是阿布鲁奇的飞机   阿布鲁奇的飞机是A计划
I thought the plan was Abruzzi's jet. Abruzzi's jet was Plan A.

14:45.950 --> 14:46.590
这么说我们还有...
Then we got...

14:46.600 --> 14:47.550
我们所需要的一切
Everything we need.

14:47.550 --> 14:48.280
在哪？
Where?

14:50.230 --> 14:51.100
仓库里
Storage.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.520
斯科菲尔德设计了这个纹身而不是你?
Scofield designed the tattoo,not you?

15:03.890 --> 15:05.140
他把整个纹身都设计好了
He brought the entire thing in,

15:05.150 --> 15:06.130
每个细节
every element.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.080
比如说这个 奇怪的西斯廷教堂
I mean,look at it,it's the freakin' Sistine Chapel.

15:09.510 --> 15:11.030
我知道这家伙是个工程师之类的
I knew the guy was an engineer or whatever,

15:11.030 --> 15:13.710
但是看看他在艺术上的造诣简直难以置信
but man,his skill as an artist was unbelievable.

15:14.570 --> 15:16.730
还有什么? 你能告诉我他这个人的性情吗?
What else? What can you tell me about him as a person?

15:18.080 --> 15:19.140
他很酷
Uh,he was cool,you know.

15:19.530 --> 15:21.190
但是凡事都对细节要求苛刻
But talk about a detail nazi.

15:21.190 --> 15:22.980
是个完美主义者
Everything had to be perfect,

15:22.990 --> 15:24.580
要求纹的与他画的一模一样
exactly as he drew it.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.130
我一直对这件事有种异样的感觉
I always sort of had the feeling that the whole thing

15:27.140 --> 15:28.950
整件事别有内情
was some sort of inside joke

15:28.960 --> 15:30.220
只有他自己清楚
that only he was in on.

15:35.570 --> 15:36.970
我们有你的电话号码对吗?
We have your number,right?

15:36.980 --> 15:37.680
对
Yeah.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.620
我会再和你联系的 谢谢
I may be calling you. Thank you.

15:44.470 --> 15:45.130
福蕾!
Foley!

15:48.580 --> 15:49.830
那条长马路叫什么名字?
What was the name of that long road

15:49.840 --> 15:50.870
就是那条我们去监狱路过的?
we took to get to the prison?

15:50.870 --> 15:52.360
English Boulevard.
English Boulevard.

15:56.900 --> 15:57.820
还有出来后的那条呢
And out in front of the prison,

15:57.830 --> 15:59.590
两条路在那里有交错
the two streets that intersect with it?

15:59.940 --> 16:01.520
Fitz和Percy 为什么问这个？
Fitz and Percy. Why?

16:01.530 --> 16:02.270
谢谢
Thank you.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.960
准备出发   我们去哪?
Saddle up. Where we going?

16:09.330 --> 16:10.840
去一个不用再当乡下人
Somewhere where we can stop being cons

16:10.850 --> 16:12.390
可以光明正大做普通人的地方
and start being civilians.

16:12.390 --> 16:15.680
你为什么不把所有的谜团都直接告诉我们呢?
You know,why don't you cut out all the riddles,Snowflake,and just give it to us straight.

16:16.730 --> 16:17.290
怎么了?
What?

16:26.910 --> 16:27.740
小孩
little one.

16:28.310 --> 16:29.230
你们在干吗?
What are you doing?

16:30.050 --> 16:31.150
那个 呃...
Well,uh...

16:33.090 --> 16:33.900
我们在钓鱼
We're just fishing.

16:36.070 --> 16:37.260
不用鱼杆吗?
With no poles?

16:38.140 --> 16:40.220
我们喜欢用手抓鱼
Well,we like to fish with our hands.

16:40.690 --> 16:41.670

Yes,eh...

16:42.040 --> 16:42.880

16:43.560 --> 16:44.850

I think the question is,

What are you doing out here?

16:51.270 --> 16:52.640
打猎     格雷西?

16:53.490 --> 16:54.770

You're those guys from Fox River.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.700
别动 一步也不要动
Don't, don't any of you move a freakin' muscle.

17:13.540 --> 17:14.410
从她边上滚开!
Get away from her!

17:14.890 --> 17:18.230
好...别激动 冷静

17:21.380 --> 17:22.190
呆在原地别动
You stay where you are.

17:23.870 --> 17:26.000
把枪放下

17:31.360 --> 17:31.870
扔掉枪
Put the gun down.

17:31.870 --> 17:33.520
把枪放下
Drop the gun!

17:34.520 --> 17:35.630
马上扔掉枪
Put down the gun,John.

17:38.130 --> 17:39.080
把枪放下

18:07.510 --> 18:08.310

18:16.440 --> 18:17.350
在路边
Up on the road.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.460
钥匙呢

18:32.050 --> 18:34.110
你被认为是从犯
You're being considered an accessory to this;

18:34.120 --> 18:35.180
你知道吗?
you know that,don't you?

18:36.920 --> 18:38.630
我现在所知甚少
I know very little right now.

18:39.070 --> 18:40.820
你打开了医务室的门
You opened the door to the infirmary

18:40.830 --> 18:42.370
让斯科菲尔德从那逃跑
that allowed Scofield to escape,

18:42.370 --> 18:43.030
是你干得吗?
didn't you?

18:44.070 --> 18:44.680

19:17.130 --> 19:17.720
怎么了 先生?
Sorry,sir?

19:18.600 --> 19:21.440
看到吗 我需要你动手术
See,I'm going to need some work done,

19:21.450 --> 19:24.020
而且我需要秘密手术
and I'm going to need it done privately.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.230
抱歉 你刚才说你需要动手术?
I'm sorry,you said you needed the work done?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.390
这里不是医疗诊所吗?
This is a medical clinic,isn't it?

19:30.770 --> 19:33.070
当然是 不过是给动物看病的
Well,of course it is,sir,but for animals.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.830
你怎么伤成这样?
Oh,man,what happened to you?

19:39.230 --> 19:40.410
你需要去医院
You need medical attention.

19:41.020 --> 19:42.040
坚持住

19:42.050 --> 19:43.400
我帮你去喊救护车
I'm going to get an ambulance.

19:46.730 --> 19:49.840
在这谁都不许打电话 明白吗  医生?
Nobody's going to be doing any calling here,Doctor.

19:49.850 --> 19:50.450
听你的
Fine.

19:54.330 --> 19:55.110
你想要什么?
Wh-What do you want?

20:03.080 --> 20:04.290
真不敢相信

20:04.830 --> 20:06.430
我想那个没良心的东西滚下车
That's it. I want Eye-Tie out of the car right now,man.

20:06.430 --> 20:07.710
那还是个小女孩呀
That was a little girl!

20:08.680 --> 20:09.500
你们难道没有良心?
Don't you have a heart?

20:10.840 --> 20:11.370
上帝

20:14.090 --> 20:15.100
我也有一个
I got one,too.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.720
但是如果我不那么干的话
But if I hadn't done what I had to do,

20:19.970 --> 20:22.310
我们以后就看不到他们了 不是吗?
we wouldn't be on our way to see'em right now,would we?

20:22.820 --> 20:23.750
在那右转弯
Turn right up there.

20:24.980 --> 20:26.020
等等 我们去哪?
Hold on. Where we going?

20:27.070 --> 20:27.830

Oswego.

20:29.150 --> 20:30.060
那是西边
That's west,man.

20:30.070 --> 20:30.990
我们要往东边赶
We need to go east.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.350
我家在芝加哥
My family's back in Chicago.

20:32.350 --> 20:34.550
你认为警察会不知道么?
And you think the cops don't know about it?

20:35.540 --> 20:39.850
你不认为他们正在你家坐等着你自投罗网吗?
You think they're not just sitting there,waiting for you to come running back home?

20:41.370 --> 20:42.310
你有毛病吧?
What's the matter with you?

20:43.180 --> 20:44.120
那去纽约如何?
Well,what about New York?

20:44.710 --> 20:45.570
怎么样?
What about it?

20:45.580 --> 20:46.830
我老婆怀孕了
My girl's pregnant,bro.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.820
他们肯定知道你的弱点
Understand your love is your weakness right now,

20:51.530 --> 20:52.630
就是你的爱情
and they know about it.

20:52.630 --> 20:53.820
那不意味着你必须放弃爱情
Doesn't mean it has to stop you.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.320
应该在这方面学的聪明点
You just got to be smart about it.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.800
去奥斯威戈
Get to Oswego.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.720
奥斯威戈不在那个方向
Oswego was not on the way,Snowflake.

21:02.150 --> 21:03.790
问题不是奥斯威戈在哪
It's not where Oswego is.

21:06.380 --> 21:07.610
问题是奥斯威戈有什么
It's what's in Oswego.

21:08.950 --> 21:11.990
队长 斯科菲尔德的信用卡记录显示
Captain,Scofield's credit card transaction history.

21:13.150 --> 21:16.310
他入狱前曾在威尔郡花了一大笔钱
Spent a lot of money here in Will County  before he was incarcerated

21:16.310 --> 21:17.910
正是 他是芝加哥来的
Exactly. He was from Chicago.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.900
为什么一个芝加哥人会远道而来
Why does a guy from Chicago come all the way out here

21:19.910 --> 21:22.200
在短短一个月内在这里花上八千块钱
and spend north of eight grand in all these places in little over a month?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.630
洗车 语音邮件 保管费 租车...
Car wash,voice mail,storage,car rental...

21:24.640 --> 21:25.740

We got guys looking into it. Good.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.070
队长  联邦调查局的人怎么办? 我们要通知他们么?
Hey,Captain,what about the Feds? Should we tell them?

21:27.070 --> 21:29.800
你说呢? 贝利克队长
What do you think? Captain Bellick?  Captain Bellick

21:29.800 --> 21:30.470
我们有了些新信息
We got something.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.690
树林那边的猎人说 刚刚遇到了逃犯中的五个人
Hunter up by Tamarack just ran into five of the cons.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.460
斯科菲尔德就住这儿?
So this is where Scofield lived?

21:42.330 --> 21:45.150
是的  直到2个月被捕前 他一直住在这
Yeah,up until about two months ago when he was incarcerated.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.340
母亲去世了 父亲不知所踪
Mother's dead,father's a deadbeat.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.920
这个世界除了你哥哥 你一无所有
You got nothing in the whole world but your brother.

22:04.730 --> 22:05.860
所以你先是计划
So you plan.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.780
然后又准备了几个月
And you scheme for months...

22:20.960 --> 22:22.070
直到理出头绪
...till you get it right.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.720
万事俱备
Every single element

22:34.980 --> 22:37.340
然后你销毁所有证据
And then you destroy all the evidence.

22:49.020 --> 22:50.540
派潜水员到河里看看
I want divers down in the river.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.320
你手机不会有信号的
You won't get cell coverage.

22:57.050 --> 22:58.170
我们在一片荒地中间
We're in the middle of nowhere.

22:59.810 --> 23:02.750
西蒙大拿这附近
Digital carriers don't have cell towers way out here

23:02.760 --> 23:04.150
没有信号塔
in Western Montana.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.560
闭嘴吧  特伦斯
How about shutting up,Terrence?

23:06.100 --> 23:07.150
帮你省点力气罢了
Just trying to save you some effort.

23:07.150 --> 23:08.580
他们像一张网一样  这些人
They're like a web,these people.

23:08.590 --> 23:10.110
你越反抗情况就越糟糕
The harder you struggle,the worse it gets.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.050
怎么听起来像个懦夫 在为自己找借口
Sounds to me like a coward trying to justify himself.

23:13.990 --> 23:16.730
如果我不坏他们的事 什么都不说  我就能活
If I stay out of the way and stay quiet,I stay alive.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.690
他们这么告诉我的
That's what they said; that's what they told me.

23:19.350 --> 23:20.620
你愿意就这么活着么?
And you're willing to live like this,

23:21.320 --> 23:22.530
活在一个密封的盒子里面
in a hermetically-sealed box

23:22.530 --> 23:26.120
看着外面变得一团糟 我得保护自己
while everything out there goes to hell? Self-preservation is a strong motivator.

23:27.020 --> 23:27.930
真相也应得到保护
So is the truth.

23:32.610 --> 23:33.360
别这么做
Don't.

23:35.850 --> 23:36.600
小姐
Young woman?

23:44.550 --> 23:45.460
别这么做
Don't.

23:49.630 --> 23:50.400
你怎么样  伙计?
How you doing,buddy?

23:51.530 --> 23:53.090
我吓坏了  就这样
I'm pretty freaked out,that's how I'm doing.

23:53.860 --> 23:54.880
他们抢了你的车  对吧?
They took your car,didn't they?

23:54.890 --> 23:56.430
78年的大切罗基
1978 Grand Cherokee.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.650
对  他们往那边去了?
Yeah. Which way did they go?

23:58.590 --> 24:00.630

女士 放下电话

37:23.250 --> 37:23.960

斯蒂德曼先生
Mr. Steadman,

37:25.480 --> 37:26.330

take a few steps back.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.380

37:35.300 --> 37:36.090

Veronica!

38:17.270 --> 38:20.400
你知道我们监控所有打给当地警局的电话
I thought you knew that all calls to the local station are routed through us.

38:20.780 --> 38:22.230
这是联邦区域 还记得吗？
This is federal land,remember?

38:22.610 --> 38:23.540

38:23.540 --> 38:25.580
恩 然后你的小玩具
And,uh,as for your little toy here,

38:26.040 --> 38:26.790
是违禁品
it's contraband.

38:27.860 --> 38:29.030
能告诉我  你怎么弄进来的？
You gonna tell us how you got it in there?

38:29.620 --> 38:31.920
来的时候买的
I brought it when I got here.

38:33.250 --> 38:34.020

Whatever for?

38:34.600 --> 38:35.920
防身的
To protect myself. Mm.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.250

That's what we're here for,remember?

39:41.560 --> 39:45.690
有个办法能让事情都顺利
There's a plan to make all of this right.

39:50.380 --> 39:53.150
不到一天 逃犯线索就变少了
In less than a day,the trail has gone cold

39:53.160 --> 39:55.130
现在的追捕变得......
in the pursuit of what are now being called...

39:55.140 --> 39:56.240
好的 行
Yeah,that's fine.

39:56.250 --> 39:57.090
继续跟进 好吗？
Stay on top of it,all right?

39:57.510 --> 39:59.390
他们还在搜索奥斯威戈市
DOC's still doing a sweep of Oswego,

39:59.390 --> 40:00.770
不过这些逃犯好像消失了一样
but the guys have basically vanished.

40:00.780 --> 40:02.530
我不这么想 艾夫斯先生
I wouldn't be so sure about that,Mr. Ives.

40:03.210 --> 40:04.640
我不知道为什么你会这么自信
I don't know how you can be so confident.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.670
他们又没有给你留下地图
It's not like these guys left a map where they're going.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.400
其实他们真的有地图
Actually,that's exactly what they did.

40:10.760 --> 40:12.790
斯科菲尔德身上有所有的计划……
Scofield had the entire thing on his body--

40:13.520 --> 40:16.910
怎么越狱 怎么消失
how to get out of that prison,how to disappear afterward

40:17.710 --> 40:18.370
都有
It's all there

40:19.700 --> 40:21.860
我向你保证只是时间问题
I promise you that it's only a matter of time

40:21.860 --> 40:26.320
我们会知道所有 斯科菲尔德脑袋里的东西
before we know everything that is in Scofield's head--

40:27.510 --> 40:29.910
他计划去哪 怎么去
where he plans to run to,how he plans to get there.

40:29.910 --> 40:32.050
等他到达的时候
So when the time comes that he does get there,

40:33.490 --> 40:34.550
我们就在那里等着他
we'll be waiting for him.
