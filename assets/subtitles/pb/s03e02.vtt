如果我从这里走出去

07:54.640 --> 07:56.640
至少给我透露下吧

07:56.670 --> 07:59.000
你用这招装无辜?
Is this the part where you pretend you're innocent?

07:59.040 --> 08:00.770
整件事情都是走卒一个?
Just a pawn in all this?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.800
如果他们之前和你说任何关于我的事
If they told you anything about me before you came here,

08:03.840 --> 08:06.140
你应该明白是真的

事先准备过的威胁论
you're prepared to layout.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.400
要是莎拉和LJ有什么三长两短
Should anything happen to Sara to LJ,

08:35.440 --> 08:36.870

08:38.400 --> 08:40.070

这样你就能安心的做好你的工作
so we can put it to bed and you can focus on your work.

09:23.940 --> 09:26.140
鉴于惠斯勒犯罪的性质
There's a political spotlight on Whistler

09:26.170 --> 09:27.770
他在政界很受关注
due to the nature of his crime.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.640
暴力解决 贿赂 随便什么招
Raids, bribes, what have you,

09:29.700 --> 09:31.140

What's the next play?

15:55.840 --> 15:57.470
惠斯勒昨天放了张纸条
Whistler got a note out

15:57.500 --> 15:59.600
在尸体上面

15:59.640 --> 16:03.200
我不知道代表什么意思 或者要给谁
I don't know what it means or who it's for.

16:04.570 --> 16:06.270
但是我们要争取主动
But we need all the leverage we can get,

16:06.300 --> 16:08.340
而且
and, uh

16:08.370 --> 16:10.100
我要点钱

16:19.700 --> 16:22.000
以前从来没有人从这里成功越狱
No one's ever broken out of this place before,

16:22.040 --> 16:24.440
更不用说用一个星期来计划了
let alone with a week to plan it,

16:24.470 --> 16:27.070
所以

我会帮那家伙越狱的
I'm going to break this guy out of here,

16:42.700 --> 16:45.140
拼死去做

16:45.170 --> 16:47.140
要是真丢了这条命
And if it's the latter,

16:47.170 --> 16:49.840
某种程度来说也是值得的 对吗?
then that should count for something, right?

16:49.870 --> 16:51.940
会有意义的
Th's got to count for something.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.570

我 我猜他是不想让你发现 对吧
I-I figure he's hiding from you, right,

22:00.110 --> 22:01.670
因为你是这儿的老大
because you run this place, right?
