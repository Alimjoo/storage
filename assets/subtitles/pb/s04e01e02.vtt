我叫迈克尔·斯科菲尔德  我是一名逃犯
My name is Michael Scofield, I am a fugitive.

00:12.090 --> 00:17.190
三周前  我被关在巴拿马的一所监狱里
Three weeks ago, I was incarcerated In a Panamanian prison.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.850
在那里...
While I was there...

00:18.890 --> 00:21.250
公司找到了我
I was approached by the Company...

00:22.820 --> 00:23.820
公司是一个腐败堕落的...
The company is a corrupt organization...

00:23.850 --> 00:28.350
渗透到行业和政府中各个层面的组织
Involved in all levels of industry and government.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.150
他们给了我两个选择
They gave me two options.

00:30.540 --> 00:35.840
帮助他们的人詹姆斯·惠斯勒越狱
Break one of their men. James Whistler out of that prison.

00:35.870 --> 00:39.240
否则就杀了我最爱的女人

00:39.270 --> 00:42.470
莎拉·唐克雷蒂医生

00:43.120 --> 00:47.020
我遵守了承诺  帮助惠斯勒成功越狱
I held up my end of deal and I broke Whistler out.

00:47.050 --> 00:48.690
但公司...
But the Company...

00:50.650 --> 00:53.190
还是杀了莎拉

00:56.090 --> 00:59.190
我不知为何公司要詹姆斯·惠斯勒越狱
I don't know why the Company wanted James Whistler out of prison.

00:59.240 --> 01:03.050
但我跟踪他来到了洛杉矶

01:03.090 --> 01:07.350
他和一位叫格雷琴的公司的特工在一起
He's with an another company agent I know only as Gretchen.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.990
就是杀害莎拉的那位特工
The same agent who murdered Sara.

01:12.150 --> 01:15.150
这一切要在今天了结
This ends today.

01:16.350 --> 01:17.750
我来这里寻求公正
I came here seeking justice.

01:17.790 --> 01:21.290
当前司法系统无法提供的公正
The justice that I now know the system cannot provide.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.490
所以如果你在读这封信的话...
So if you're reading this letter...

01:27.520 --> 01:30.220
你就明白我为给莎拉报仇在所不惜
You'll know I died avenging Sara's death.

03:51.490 --> 03:53.120

03:53.160 --> 03:55.620

04:10.260 --> 04:12.960

04:55.360 --> 04:57.460
拿着那东西要小心点

04:57.480 --> 04:59.960
公司为了夺回它会不惜一切代价
The Company will do anything to get it back.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.260
我难道不知道吗
Don't I know it.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.660
-什么事  -你到底在干什么
-Yeah? -What the hell are you doing?

05:32.680 --> 05:33.980
我们得马上离开这里

05:34.020 --> 05:35.360
我要把枪藏好

05:35.380 --> 05:37.250
把枪带在身上
Take the gun with you!

05:47.950 --> 05:49.250
快呀
Come on.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.350
她在哪
Where is she?

05:53.310 --> 05:56.180
迈克尔  你不明白
Michael, you don't understand.

05:56.210 --> 05:59.210
给格雷琴打电话  让她马上来这儿
Call Gretchen, get her in here now.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.780
你得相信我
You have to trust me.

06:00.810 --> 06:02.350
我不是你的敌人  迈克尔
I'm not your enemy, Michael.

06:02.380 --> 06:03.750
詹姆斯
James.

06:06.180 --> 06:07.910
我们得快离开
We need to leave.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.280
知道吗  无论如何...
You know, despite everything...

06:10.310 --> 06:12.450
即使现在莎拉还活着 她也会让我别杀你
If Sara could weigh in right now. She'd tell me not to kill you.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.650
她就是这样的人
That's the kind of person she was.

06:15.010 --> 06:17.310
你就是把这样的人从我身边夺走了
That's the kind of person you took from me.

06:17.350 --> 06:19.650
詹姆斯  难道你没告诉他吗
James, didn't you tell him?

06:19.980 --> 06:21.250
-他刚刚才...  -闭嘴
-He walked in five... -Shut up!

06:21.280 --> 06:23.580
格雷琴  看着我

06:25.180 --> 06:26.350
这个为了莎拉
This is for Sara.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.750
我没杀莎拉
I never killed Sara.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.650
我就知道你这样的人是不会坦然承认的
I wouldn't expect someone like you to take this with dignity.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.160
我发誓她还活着
I swear to God she's alive.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.450
别侮辱我  也别侮辱她
Don't insult me and don't insult her.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.910
她逃掉了
She escaped.

06:36.950 --> 06:39.350
我们清楚如果你知道  我们就没有任何筹码了
We knew if you found out we wouldn't have any leverage.

06:39.380 --> 06:41.450
我编造了整件事
I fabricated the whole thing.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.260
我哥哥看到了...
My brother saw... 

06:43.270 --> 06:45.480

你问问林肯他看到的到底是什么

06:47.180 --> 06:48.750
-听她说  迈克尔  -别对我撒谎
-Listen to her, Michael. -Don't lie to me.

06:48.780 --> 06:50.280
我没撒谎  林肯上当了
I'm not lying to you. Lincoln bought it...

06:50.310 --> 06:53.180
你也上当了  骗局成功了
You bought it, it worked.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.180
迈克尔
Michael.

06:56.210 --> 06:57.450
那她在哪
Then where is she?

06:57.480 --> 06:58.980
我们出去后  我就告诉你
I'll tell you when we get outside.

06:59.010 --> 07:02.080
现在  我们要先离开这里
Right now, we need to get out of here.

07:02.150 --> 07:03.280
他们发现尸体了
They found the bodies.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.750
-把枪给我  -她在撒谎
-Give me the gun. -She's lying.

07:07.780 --> 07:08.910
是吗
Is she?

07:08.950 --> 07:10.780
如果你扣动扳机  就永远不会知道答案了
If you pull that trigger, you'll never know.

07:10.810 --> 07:12.710
杀了他  詹姆斯
Kill him, James.

07:12.750 --> 07:13.780
闭嘴
Shut up.

07:13.810 --> 07:15.010

Where is she?

07:15.050 --> 07:16.550
莎拉在哪
Where is Sara.

07:16.580 --> 07:18.080
迈克尔
Michael.

07:18.110 --> 07:20.210
如果你不把枪给我
If you don't give me that gun.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.210
我就打爆你的头
I'm going to shoot you in the head.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.830
我们走
Let's go.

07:39.130 --> 07:41.630
我们在罗斯福酒店发现两具尸体
We got a double homicide at the Roosevelt Hotel.

08:01.390 --> 08:03.490
莎拉
Sara

08:09.010 --> 08:10.730
莫哈维沙漠  加州
Mojave desert, california.

08:25.250 --> 08:29.390
你知道完美成功的行动和失败的行动...
Do you know the difference between a perfectly executed operation...

08:29.420 --> 08:31.190
之间的区别吗
And a failed mission?

08:31.220 --> 08:34.650
-长官  -取决于小团队的领导力
-Sir? -It's small unit leadership.

08:34.690 --> 08:36.490
盟军用了两年半时间...
The Allies spent two and a half years...

08:36.520 --> 08:38.550
策划进攻诺曼底
Planning the invasion of Normandy.

08:38.590 --> 08:40.490
但在登陆日那天  一排滩头上的...
But on D-Day it came down to a handful of men...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.820
一小股部队...
On a strip of beach...

08:42.850 --> 08:45.250
来决定整个世界的命运
To decide the fate of the world.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.760
格雷琴  我想说的是...
What I'm getting at, Gretchen...

08:47.790 --> 08:50.420
即便是最好的计划...
Is even the best plan is only as good...

08:50.460 --> 08:53.290
也需要有人去执行才会成功
As the moving parts on the ground executing it.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.560
-将军  我们拿到了数据卡  -有什么问题吗
-General, we got your card. -what's the problem?

08:57.160 --> 08:59.820
我们什么都没拿到  这是赝品
We have nothing. It's a duplicate.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.220
几乎一模一样  但是个赝品
Almost flawless, but a duplicate.

09:02.590 --> 09:04.560
这不可能  我看到...
That's impossible, I saw...

09:04.590 --> 09:06.360
你知道夺回数据卡对我来说...
You know how important the retrieval of this card...

09:06.390 --> 09:08.120
有多重要  格雷琴
Is to me, Gretchen.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.960
你知道这是一个很可能...
You know that this is a security breach...

09:09.990 --> 09:13.960
对公司产生灾难性的后果的安全隐患
that could have catastrophic ramifications for the Company.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.420
我想唯一的可能就是...
The only thing I can think of...

09:16.460 --> 09:19.720
当惠斯勒灭口的时候  有段时间可以做手脚
There was a blind spot when Whistler was hitting the target.

09:19.790 --> 09:22.590
他可能复制了一份  并且还保留着原件
Maybe he made a duplicate and he still has the original.

09:22.620 --> 09:24.390
你雇用了他
You hired him.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.930
你对他委以重任
You kept him at the tip of the spear.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.490
你坚持要把他从索纳监狱捞出来
You insisted that we get him out of Sona.

09:29.530 --> 09:30.960
我们别无选择
We had to.

09:30.990 --> 09:33.060
他当时已经和目标联系上
He had already made contact with the target.

09:33.090 --> 09:35.190
当时  他是唯一的选择  长官
At that point, it was him or no one, sir.

09:35.230 --> 09:38.790
你能从这件事中得到什么好处
What's your stake in all of this?

09:38.830 --> 09:41.730
这件事与我无关  是惠斯勒一手策划的
I had nothing to do with it, Whistler acted on his own.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.090
我向你发誓
I swear to you.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.790
将军  我会补救的
General, I can fix this.

09:46.830 --> 09:48.330
你训练了我
You trained me.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.860
显然训练的不够好
Not well enough, apparently.

09:54.230 --> 09:55.860
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

09:58.690 --> 09:59.760
求求你
Please.

09:59.790 --> 10:01.760
我在迪拜有一个帐户
I have a bank account in Dubai.

10:01.790 --> 10:04.530
存有眼镜蛇2次行动中的贿金  是你的了
Left over from a slush fund from COBRA II, it's yours.

10:04.730 --> 10:05.860

LJ和索菲亚怎么样
How's LJ and Sofia?

10:27.530 --> 10:31.290
他们...我正看着他们呢
Yeah, they're...I'm staring at them right now in fact.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.990
他们很好
They're fine.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.230
听说索纳监狱的事了吗
You hear about Sona?

10:34.260 --> 10:35.190
怎么了
What about it?

10:35.230 --> 10:37.530
三天前被囚犯夷为平地了
Burned down three days back by the inmates.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.530
囚犯暴乱了  没有贝里克  蒂博格和苏克雷的迹象
They rioted. no sign of Bellick, T-Bag, or Sucre.

10:40.990 --> 10:42.260
苏克雷
Sucre?

10:42.290 --> 10:43.930
他被抓了  我不知道原因
He got popped, I don't know how.

10:43.980 --> 10:45.360
报纸上登出了囚犯名单...
I mean, the papers listed the names of the inmates...

10:45.390 --> 10:47.760
监狱烧毁之前他在里面
And he was in there when it went down.

10:48.730 --> 10:50.930
我找到惠斯勒和格雷琴了
I found Whistler and Gretchen...

10:55.190 --> 10:56.860
格雷琴说...
Gretchen said...

10:58.860 --> 11:01.030
她说莎拉还活着
She said Sara is still alive.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.790
你究竟看到了什么  林肯
What did you see, Linc?

11:05.830 --> 11:07.590
你是什么意思  迈克尔
What do you mean what did I see, Michael?

11:07.630 --> 11:09.860
我要你告诉我  你到底看到了什么
I need you to tell me exactly what you saw.

11:09.890 --> 11:11.190
迈克尔  莎拉已经死了
Michael, Sara's gone.

11:11.530 --> 11:14.160
你说是在一个车库里  对吗  所以那一定很暗
You said it was in a garage, right? So it was dark.

11:14.190 --> 11:16.290
对  是很暗
Yeah, it was dark.

11:18.330 --> 11:20.530
但是如果你是在问  我是否拿起头...
But if you're asking me if I picked up the head...

11:20.560 --> 11:24.090
检查是不是莎拉  不  迈克尔  我...
To check to see if it was Sara, no, Michael, I-I...

11:24.130 --> 11:27.490
LJ说他...
LJ said he...

11:27.530 --> 11:29.260
他只是听到他们杀了莎拉  对吗
He only heard them kill Sara, right?

11:29.290 --> 11:31.430
你快回来吧  拜托
You just got to come back, please.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.090

11:33.130 --> 11:34.660
一起开始新生活
Let's just start a new life.

11:34.690 --> 11:37.090
替我向索菲亚问好
Tell Sofia I said hi.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.890
告诉LJ...
And tell LJ...

11:38.930 --> 11:40.890
告诉他  他叔叔很爱他
Tell him his uncle loves him.

11:40.930 --> 11:43.060
迈克尔  别这样  求你了
Michael, don't do this, please.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.830
亚利桑那沙漠  距离墨西哥边境5公里
Arizona Desert, 5 miles from the mexican border.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.430
出来  出来
Out, out!

12:06.460 --> 12:08.860
你该换一个好点的通风设备  朋友
You need some better ventilation back there, amigo.

12:10.190 --> 12:11.130
想要翻译一下吗
Want to translate that?

12:11.160 --> 12:12.090
不用了
Don't worry about it.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.260
谢谢
Gracias.

12:16.830 --> 12:17.830
你妈妈在哪儿
Where's your mom?

12:17.860 --> 12:18.760
她会来的
She'll be here.

12:18.790 --> 12:19.960
她回来的是什么意思
What do you mean she'll be here?

12:19.990 --> 12:21.060
我们没时间了
We're running out of time.

12:21.090 --> 12:22.660
-我得赶过去  -别担心
-I got to be up there. -Don't worry.

12:22.690 --> 12:24.030
我妈妈不会让我失望的
My mom wouldn't let me down.

12:26.190 --> 12:27.930
至少  目前还没有
At least, she hasn't yet.

12:29.190 --> 12:31.230
布莱利  这里
Bradley, over here!

12:31.430 --> 12:32.860
妈妈  妈妈
Mom! Mom!

12:32.890 --> 12:35.190
我告诉过你的  别担心  你会准时到的
I told you! Don't worry, you'll make it there!

12:45.990 --> 12:47.190
网址是什么
What is it called?

12:47.230 --> 12:49.230
EuropeanGoldfinch.net
EuropeanGoldfinch.net

12:49.260 --> 12:51.730
我们可以用它联系
It's what we can all use to communicate.

13:06.260 --> 13:09.260
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德  我有莎拉的消息
MS: I have info on Sara.

13:20.530 --> 13:21.530
迈克尔
Michael

13:27.630 --> 13:30.260
别紧张  我是一个人
Don't worry, I'm alone.

13:30.460 --> 13:31.560
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.200
你最好的朋友在哪
So where's your new best friend?

13:35.300 --> 13:36.400
我不知道
I don't know about that.

13:36.430 --> 13:38.500
但惠斯勒并不是你想的那样
But Whistler's not who you think he is.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.200
我们在联手对付公司
We're working together against the Company.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.000
-是吗  -是的
-Yeah?  -Yeah.

13:44.030 --> 13:45.500
那格雷琴呢
And what about Gretchen?

13:45.530 --> 13:46.500
她也是同你一起的
She working with you?

13:47.100 --> 13:49.530
他需要她来强化他的计划
He needed her to further his plan.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.800
听着  如果他是公司的人  上次见面的时候...
Look, if the guy was Company, he'd have shot you dead...

13:51.850 --> 13:53.430
他就该照她说的杀了你
Back at that conference like she wanted him to.

13:53.460 --> 13:57.200
你到底有没有莎拉的消息
Do you have any information about Sara or not?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.900
我们找个僻静一点的地方
Let's go somewhere a little more private.

14:00.930 --> 14:02.260
我要你现在就告诉我
I want you to tell me right now.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.500
我要你告诉我  就现在  就在这里
I want you to tell me right now, right here!

14:04.550 --> 14:05.940
或者我们可以给格雷琴挂电话
Or we can get Gretchen on the phone.

14:05.950 --> 14:07.400
格雷琴死了
Gretchen's dead.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.000
她一直没出现
She never showed up.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.300
来和我谈谈  拜托
Come and talk to me, please.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.700
惠斯勒和我去会面为的是拿一张数据卡
Whistler and I were at that conference to get a data card.

14:20.730 --> 14:22.400
那就像是公司的黑名册
It's like the Company's black book.

14:22.430 --> 14:25.700
记录着他们所有的特工和行动
And it lists all their agents, all their operations.

14:25.730 --> 14:27.530
他们称之为...
They refer to it as...

14:27.560 --> 14:29.200
锡拉
"Scylla."

14:29.500 --> 14:30.500
惠斯勒拿到手了
Whistler's got it.

14:30.530 --> 14:32.160
阿历克斯  跟我谈谈莎拉的事
Alex, talk to me about Sara.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.260
我只关心这点
That's all I care about.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.530
我理解
I understand that.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.530
我也只想回家跟妻儿团聚
I want nothing more than to get home to my wife and my son.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.600
但只要公司在追杀我们...
But that's not gonna happen for either of us...

14:39.650 --> 14:41.030
对我们来说  这都是可望不可求
With the Company out there trying to kill us.

14:41.060 --> 14:42.960
你根本就没有莎拉的消息  对吧
You don't know anything about Sara, do you?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.930
惠斯勒有  他告诉他知道
Whistler does, he tells me he does.

14:45.060 --> 14:47.560
他想告诉你
And he wants to tell you.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.960
但他要东西来交换
But he wants something in return.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.100
什么  他想要什么
What? What does he want from me?

14:51.130 --> 14:52.360
同你见面
To talk to you.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.000
对于那晚的事  我很抱歉
I'm sorry about all that the other night.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.100
当时如果有时间的话  我会解释的更清楚
If I had more time, I would've explained myself better.

15:08.130 --> 15:09.160
当然
Sure.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.200
我们来这做什么
What are we doing here?

15:10.230 --> 15:12.260
-阿历克斯告诉你锡拉的事了  -是的
-Alex told you about Scylla? -Yes.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.030
在我这里
I have it.

15:14.060 --> 15:16.560
还差一步就可以读取里面的数据了
There's one last step involved in order to read the data.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.730
要完成这一步  需要闯入一个戒备森严的地方
And that step involves breaking into a secured structure.

15:19.760 --> 15:20.830
所以你需要我帮忙
So now you need my help.

15:21.030 --> 15:22.030
对
Yeah.

15:22.060 --> 15:23.800
我的书  我在索纳监狱丢的那本鸟类书...
My book, the bird book, the one I lost in Sona...

15:23.830 --> 15:26.850
里面有能帮我们更容易的闯入的信息
Contained information that would've helped facilitate the break-in.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.430
但即便没有  我们也能做到
but it can still be accomplished,

15:28.460 --> 15:29.850
在你的帮助之下
With your help.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.000
莎拉在哪
Where's Sara?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.900
我唯一能确定的是...
The only thing I know for sure...

15:35.300 --> 15:38.900
一周前  有消息吐露
A week ago, some information came through the wire.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.330
莎拉在圣达菲买了一张巴士票
Sara may have bought a bus ticket in Santa Fe.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.560
开往哪的
Headed where?

15:43.600 --> 15:44.700
芝加哥
Chicago.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.100
迈克尔  如果莎拉在芝加哥  她并不安全
Michael, if Sara's out there, she's not safe.

15:47.130 --> 15:48.200
我们大家都不安全
None of us are.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.000
公司知道原始数据卡在我们手里
The Company knows we still have the original card.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.900
这就是格雷琴死了的原因
And that's why Gretchen was the first to go.

15:52.930 --> 15:54.200
我想我们没什么好谈的了
I think we're done here.

15:54.230 --> 15:57.100
迈克尔  我们只有这一次机会
Michael, We have a chance for once

15:57.400 --> 15:59.900
将锡拉交给那些想搞垮公司的人
To get Scylla to people that want to take the Company down.

15:59.930 --> 16:03.530
我不想再逃了  我们都不必再逃了
I don't want to run anymore. We won't have to run anymore.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.700
之前的一个月  我一直沉浸在失去莎拉的痛苦和...
I spent the last month thinking Sara was dead...

16:06.710 --> 16:08.230
害死莎拉的自责之中
and that it was my fault.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.460
如果她在芝加哥  我要去找她
If she's out there, I'm gonna find her.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.000
我只关心这个
That's all I care about.

16:12.050 --> 16:13.900
只要一周就能搞定
This can be done within a week.

16:13.930 --> 16:15.400
不到一周
Less.

16:15.430 --> 16:17.000
至少让我给你们...
At least let me show you...

16:54.120 --> 16:56.220
巴拿马城  巴拿马
Panama City, Panama

16:56.850 --> 17:00.520
我会想念这对美腿的  美女
Oh, I'm gonna miss these gams, girl.

17:00.570 --> 17:02.150
别走
Don't go.

17:02.750 --> 17:05.410
这里可不是来自阿拉巴马的白人的家
This ain't no home for a white boy from Alabama.

17:06.550 --> 17:09.150
他们到了  先生  行李都准备好了
They're here, seur, the bags are packed.

17:23.450 --> 17:25.810
你遵守了对我的诺言
You kept your word to me.

17:26.450 --> 17:28.710
你是第一个做到这点的人  谢谢
You're the first that's ever done that. Gracias.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.610
你为何一定要找这个人
Why must you go after this man?

17:33.650 --> 17:35.450
你可以选择不去的
You could choose not to.

17:35.470 --> 17:38.700
在我的家乡  有个词叫做宿敌
Where I come from, there's something called a blood feud.

17:38.730 --> 17:40.070
明白吗
Comprende?

17:40.120 --> 17:41.120
是的
Yes.

17:41.170 --> 17:42.770
结果是迈克尔·斯科菲尔德...
Michael Scofield left me for dead...

17:42.800 --> 17:44.730
很多次的都对我见死不救
One too many times, as it turns out.

17:46.470 --> 17:48.570
"小天使"用西班牙语怎么说
What is Spanish for "little angel"?

17:48.620 --> 17:50.300
Angelita
Angelita.

17:52.750 --> 17:55.750
再见  小天使
Adios, angelita.

18:04.120 --> 18:04.970
确定合法吗
Is this legit?

18:05.020 --> 18:06.020
当然  先生
Oh, Sí seur

18:06.050 --> 18:10.520
您付了那么多钱  全程头等服务
For the money you're paying, first class, all the way.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.820
这些人都可信吧
So these are coyotes one could trust.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.420
当然  先生
Oh, Sí seur.

18:14.820 --> 18:16.620
很好
Vamanos.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.660
如你所见...
As you've seen...

18:41.690 --> 18:45.590
你参与的这件事是很重要的
What you're entering into is quite serious.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.220
我明白
I realize that.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.690
你现在对此负责了
You're responsible for this now.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.060
您不必担心
You have nothing to worry about.

18:52.350 --> 18:54.920
稍后再谈
We'll talk soon.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.550
现在该收拾残局了
It's time to clean up now.

19:01.580 --> 19:02.650
彻底的
Thoroughly.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.850
所有曾跟惠斯勒接触过的人
Everyone who was close to Whistler.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.450
斯科菲尔德
Scofield.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.650
马宏  布鲁斯
Mahone, Burrows.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.180
布鲁斯还在巴拿马
Burrows is still in Panama.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.420
都干掉
Clean up.

19:24.850 --> 19:26.350

And Cameron?

19:54.420 --> 19:56.120

19:56.150 --> 19:58.620
我得告诉你  帕姆
I have to tell you, Pam, you know.

19:58.650 --> 20:02.650
为了我们能在一起  我有个计划
I had a plan for all of us to be together.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.150
而且...
And...

20:05.680 --> 20:09.020
我是不会放弃的
I'm not gonna stop working on it.

20:09.150 --> 20:13.080
你想和我们在一起的话  干嘛还需要计划呢
Why do you need a plan if you want to be with someone?

20:13.120 --> 20:15.880
去和他们在一起就是了
You just be with them.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.450
除非你是认真的  否则别这么说
Don't say that unless you mean it.

20:20.650 --> 20:24.050
因为为了和你们在一起  我会不惜一切
'Cse I'll turn this world upside down to get back to you.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.850
所以除非你是认真的  否则别这么说
So don't say it unless you mean it.

20:26.880 --> 20:30.150
我是认真的
I mean it.

20:30.650 --> 20:32.550
好
Okay.

20:34.950 --> 20:36.780

我讨厌芭蕉  你知道的
I-I hate plantains, you know that.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.530
我尝过你的辣汉堡了
I try your chili burger.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.730

我们已经安全了啊
We're safe now.

21:10.630 --> 21:13.100

22:01.960 --> 22:03.230
林肯

22:03.260 --> 22:04.700
林肯

22:22.650 --> 22:24.280
我找阿历克斯
I'm looking for Alex.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.580
我不知道他在哪儿
I don't know where he is.

22:27.810 --> 22:29.780
不知道
No?

22:29.810 --> 22:31.110
不知道
No.

22:31.130 --> 22:33.030
我们已经离婚快两年了
Uh, we've been divorced for almost two years now.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.890
好几个月都没有联系了
We haven't had contact in months.

22:34.930 --> 22:38.990
我想现在可能不同了  他回美国了
I would think that might change now that he's back in the U.S.

22:40.630 --> 22:43.130
我真受不了你们这群人  是联邦探员吗
I am so sick of you people, what are you a fed?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.960
以为可以不断骚扰我们吗
Thinking that you can keep on harassing...

22:44.990 --> 22:47.880
我不是政府官员  帕姆
I'm not with the government, Pam.

22:48.490 --> 22:50.390
妈妈  你能来一下吗
Mom, could you come here?

22:51.260 --> 22:53.830
我们没什么好谈的
We're done talking.

23:35.590 --> 23:36.760
布鲁斯·班尼特
Bruce Bennett.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.190
你知道我是谁吗
Do you know who this is?

23:40.460 --> 23:42.030
知道
I do.

23:42.060 --> 23:45.190
我在找莎拉  然而现在...
I'm looking for Sara, and right now...

23:45.230 --> 23:48.380
你是我能想到的唯一能帮我的人
You're the only person I can think of who can help me.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.380
等一下
Hold on.

24:00.030 --> 24:00.930
你在哪
Where are you?

24:00.960 --> 24:03.260
我回芝加哥了
Back in Chicago.

24:03.290 --> 24:04.330
你有她的消息吗
Have you heard from her?

24:04.360 --> 24:06.630
半小时后到德雷克酒店门口见我
Meet me in front of the Drake Hotel in a half hour.

24:06.660 --> 24:09.930
请告诉我  她还活着吗
Please just tell me, is she alive?

24:12.030 --> 24:14.090
你是迈克尔·斯科菲尔德吗
Are you Michael Scofield?

24:17.660 --> 24:19.890
你是迈克尔·斯科菲尔德吗
Are you Michael Scofield?

24:22.960 --> 24:24.630
是的  我是
Yes, I am.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.680
-把手放到头后  -迈克尔  迈克尔
-Hands on your head. -Michael, Michael

24:40.020 --> 24:41.290
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield

24:41.320 --> 24:45.020
我是国土安全局的特工当·赛尔夫
Special Agent Don Self, Homeland Security.

24:45.520 --> 24:48.820
詹姆士·惠斯勒被杀的时候  你在场吗
Were youhere when James Whistler was killed?

24:48.920 --> 24:50.120
不是我干的
I didn't kill him.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.520
我知道不是你干的
I know you didn't.

24:52.580 --> 24:55.820
他曾是一位为公司工作了...
He was an independent contractor.

24:56.220 --> 24:59.880
差不多10年的独立签约人
Who worked for the Company for about ten years.

24:59.920 --> 25:03.180
公司派他追寻遗失的锡拉的下落
He was assigned to retrieve Scylla once it went missing.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.920
你知道锡拉是什么吗
Do you know what Scylla is?

25:06.950 --> 25:09.120
是公司的黑名册
It's the Company's little black book.

25:09.170 --> 25:12.240
他本该拷贝一份交给我
So he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me.

25:12.270 --> 25:13.440
你想要我做什么
What do you want from me?

25:13.470 --> 25:16.210
你将被判以重罪
You're looking at major time.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.770
你知道的  对吗
You know that, right?

25:18.020 --> 25:22.120
你觉得如果让你摆脱干系...
So how would you like to walk away from it all...

25:22.150 --> 25:24.520
全身而退如何
not do a day?

25:24.550 --> 25:27.520
-用什么交换  -锡拉
-In exchange for...? -Scylla.

25:28.520 --> 25:32.750
好  莎拉·唐克雷蒂  最后出现在巴拿马
All right. Sara Tancredi, last seen in Panama.

25:32.780 --> 25:34.880
如果你帮我找到她...
If you help me find her...

25:34.920 --> 25:36.120
也许我们可以做交易
Maybe we've got a deal.

25:36.150 --> 25:38.320
对不起  她的事不归我管  我只管锡拉
I'm sorry, she's not my department, Scylla is.

25:38.350 --> 25:39.720
那你自己去找吧
Then go find it yourself.

25:39.750 --> 25:40.720
在我看来...
It seems to me...

25:40.730 --> 25:42.820
美国政府应该比要被判以重罪的人...
The U.S. government should have a little more reach...

25:42.850 --> 25:44.920
更有手段
Than someone who's looking at major time.

25:44.950 --> 25:46.950
如果要找莎拉的话  迈克尔
To perform the operation, Michael.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.980
需要大约20个...
That would require signatures...

25:49.020 --> 25:51.050
不同部门领导的签名才行
From about 20 different department heads.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.480
你要赌赌  他们之中至少有一个是公司的人吗
Do you want to bet at least one of them is Company?

25:53.520 --> 25:55.320
唯一可行的办法是...
The only way this is going to work...

25:55.350 --> 25:58.120
通过编外人员  地下行事
Is via freelancer, off the books.

25:58.150 --> 25:59.780
听起来很复杂
It sounds complicated.

25:59.820 --> 26:01.420
交易告吹
I'll take a pass.

26:01.450 --> 26:04.080
我提供给你的是一个免除15年刑期的机会...
I'm giving you an opportunity to avoid 15 years in jail...

26:04.120 --> 26:06.880
更不用说你哥哥所面临的了
Not to mention the time that your brother's facing.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.480
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

26:08.520 --> 26:10.620
公司想把他弄出巴拿马
The Company tried to take him out in Panama.

26:10.650 --> 26:13.580
他反抗了
He, um... reacted.

26:13.620 --> 26:15.620
很显然
Apparently.

26:15.650 --> 26:17.080
但我刚刚同...
But I just made a deal...

26:17.120 --> 26:18.480
巴拿马当局达成协议...
With the Panamanian authorities...

26:18.520 --> 26:20.580
让他返回美国服刑
For him to serve out his time in the U.S.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.580
他随时可能到达
He should be touching ground any time now.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.450
你能认出这笔迹吗
You recognize this handwriting?

26:31.780 --> 26:33.320
是你父亲的
This is your father's.

26:33.350 --> 26:34.880
在他生命的最后两年里...
He spent the last two years...

26:34.920 --> 26:38.480
一直在追查这件事
of his life going after this very thing.

26:44.620 --> 26:47.180
你相信命运吗  迈克尔
Do you believe in fate, Michael?

26:47.220 --> 26:50.850
我要跟我哥哥谈一谈
I think I'd like to talk to my brother.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.420
不
Oh, no.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.750
不
Oh, no.

27:10.180 --> 27:11.620
怎么回事...
What's going...?

27:14.120 --> 27:17.820
站住  站住  你不能进去
Stop! Stop! You don't want to go in there.

27:17.850 --> 27:20.220
你不能进去
You don't want to go in there.

27:23.820 --> 27:26.220
我们很遗憾
We're sorry, sorry.

27:50.780 --> 27:52.880
天啊  她...
God, she's...

27:52.920 --> 27:55.780
莉拉·玛丽亚·苏克雷
Lilah Maria Sucre.

27:55.820 --> 27:58.620
她用了我的姓
She gave her my name?

28:00.480 --> 28:03.420
我是你爸爸哦
Soy tu papa.

28:14.050 --> 28:15.380
你出卖我
You're setting me up?

28:15.420 --> 28:18.950
苏克雷  你不能再拖累玛丽克鲁兹了
Sucre, you can't keep bringing Maricruz down.

28:18.980 --> 28:22.020
你不能再这样对她了
You can't do this to her anymore.

28:22.220 --> 28:26.020
-没事的  -等等  别...
-It's OK. -Wait. Don't...

28:26.050 --> 28:27.720
苏克雷  不要
Sucre, don't...

28:28.780 --> 28:30.120
快  快
Go! Go!

28:30.150 --> 28:31.550
天啊
Oh, boy.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.320
我们完蛋了
We're screwed.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.350
你们知道为什么斯科菲尔德...
You know why Scofield...

28:48.380 --> 28:50.250
在我身边的时候总是苦恼不堪吗
Gets all twisted up when he's around me?

28:51.120 --> 28:53.420
我们很相似  可他却不想承认这一点
We're the same, and he just can't stand it.

28:53.460 --> 28:55.560
这让他近乎疯狂
Drives his ass crazy.

28:55.590 --> 28:57.160
我们有同样聪明的头脑
We got the same brilliant mind.

28:57.190 --> 29:00.020
同样与生俱来的领导能力
the same natural-born leader tendency.

29:00.060 --> 29:03.260
同样万里挑一的个人魅力  对吧
the same one-in-a-million-type charisma, yes?

29:03.290 --> 29:06.190
他却总是看不起我
He just gonna look down his nose at me?

29:06.220 --> 29:08.290
你要怎么找到他
How you gonna find him?

29:09.320 --> 29:11.320
这个
This.

29:11.620 --> 29:13.290
你们都喜欢鸟
You're both into birds?

29:13.320 --> 29:14.720
不
No, no.

29:14.760 --> 29:18.090
它要么带我找到他  要么就是他找到我
It's either gonna take me to him, or he to me.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.990
我就知道
I just know it.

29:20.020 --> 29:22.160
如果我是你  我就忘掉斯科菲尔德
If I was you, I'd forget about this Scofield.

29:22.190 --> 29:24.020
你有大把的钱  瞧  我是说...
You have plenty of money. See? I mean...

29:24.060 --> 29:26.120
你包里装了多少钱
How much money you have in that bag?

29:26.160 --> 29:28.520
为何不管好你们自己的事
Why don't you just mind your own beeswax, huh?

29:29.820 --> 29:30.920
你就把这破车...
You just keep pointing...

29:30.960 --> 29:33.320
一直往北开就行  好吗
this jalopy northbound, all right?

29:33.360 --> 29:35.190
带我回美国
Get me back to the land 'o cotton.

29:35.220 --> 29:36.720
当然
Of course.

29:37.020 --> 29:39.520
准备好了
Ready.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.360
政府只有几个人知道这次的行动
Only a few people in government will know of the operation.

30:02.390 --> 30:03.820
必须得这样...
It has to stay that way...

30:03.860 --> 30:06.590
否则大家都会处于危险之中  包括我
Or people's lives will be in danger, mine included.

30:06.620 --> 30:10.020
把公司搞跨听起来不太像是两个人的工作  对吧
Taking down the company sounds a little bit more than a two-man job, no?

30:10.060 --> 30:11.290
我会找人帮助你们
I'm going to get you help.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.340
你不是说你不能相信任何人吗
I thought you said, you couldn't trust anybody.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.360
是  不过也许你们可以
Yeah, but maybe you can.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.160
你们的两个朋友...
All right, two of your cohorts...

30:15.190 --> 30:18.760
费尔南多·苏克雷和布拉德·贝里克被捕了
Fernando Sucre, and Brad Bellick were arrested.

30:18.790 --> 30:20.220
他们都面临牢狱之灾
They're both facing time.

30:20.260 --> 30:23.120
亚历山大·马宏在科罗拉多的监狱里
And Alexander Mahone is in a Colorado jail cell.

30:23.140 --> 30:25.060
很好  就让他待在那好了
Good, let him sit there.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.760
想要成功  我们需要马宏
You're going to need Mahone if you want to make this happen.

30:26.990 --> 30:28.660
他曾经和惠斯勒合作过
He was working with Whistler.

30:28.990 --> 30:30.560
我也会加入
And you'll have me.

30:30.590 --> 30:33.120
如何  无论你们需要什么  我都会提供
Okay? Whatever you need, I'll provide.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.220
惠斯勒还提过第二步计划
Whistler also said something about a second step,

30:35.260 --> 30:37.120
关于闯入某个地方
Something about a break-in.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.520
是的  卡里储存着所有的数据
Yeah, the card has all the data on it.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.160
但是被加密了
But it's encrypted.

30:41.190 --> 30:42.490
一旦你开始行动
Once you get your hands on it.

30:42.520 --> 30:43.820
你就必须找到一个进入...
You're going to need to find a way to break...

30:43.860 --> 30:45.320
公司总部的办法
Into the Company's headquarters.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.990
这是解密那张卡的唯一办法
It's the only way to unlock what's on the card.

30:47.020 --> 30:47.990
总部在哪
Where's the building?

30:48.020 --> 30:49.590
-洛杉矶  -洛杉矶的哪里
-L.A. -Where in L.A.?

30:49.620 --> 30:50.920
我不清楚
I don't know.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.260
所以  我们要找到不知在何处的数据卡
So, we've got a data card, which could be anywhere.

30:53.290 --> 30:54.660
然后闯入一个...
And we've got to break into a building...

30:54.690 --> 30:56.690
确切地址不明的总部大楼
The location of which has yet to be determined.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.260
很简单
Simple enough.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.590
你曾经两次成功越狱
You've broken out of two penitentiaries.

30:59.620 --> 31:02.390
我想闯入一座总部大楼...
I'm thinking, uh, breaking into a building...

31:02.420 --> 31:04.760
对你来说应该不是太难吧
Isn't too far outside your wheelhouse.

31:04.790 --> 31:06.160
你怎么知道我们父亲的
How do you know our dad?

31:06.190 --> 31:10.320
他通过线人了解到我可以信任
He heard from contacts that I could be trusted.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.890
你爸爸是个好人
Your father was a good man.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.460
为什么是现在
Why now?

31:13.490 --> 31:15.590
听着  我已经追查公司5年了
Look, I've been going after the Company for five years.

31:15.620 --> 31:18.320
好吗  昨天惠斯勒被杀后...
Okay? When Whistler was killed yesterday...

31:18.360 --> 31:20.860
整个调查行动都应该停止了
The plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation.

31:20.890 --> 31:22.960
但是...
But, uh...

31:22.990 --> 31:25.490
我说服我的上司再试最后一次
I convinced my superiors to give it one more chance.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.760
这就像是你的保住饭碗行动
So this is like job security for you?

31:27.790 --> 31:28.760
什么
What's that?

31:28.790 --> 31:30.820
所以当我们冲锋陷阵的时候...
Well, when we go out there and risk our necks...

31:30.830 --> 31:32.320
你就能确保你的退休金了
You can collect your pension.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.790
不  不  林肯
No, no, no, Lincoln.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.560
有些人关心的是自己的工作
Okay, some people still care about their job.

31:35.590 --> 31:37.520
有些人是在为这个国家而奋斗
Some people still fight for this country.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.420
也许你太过于...
Maybe you've been a little too distracted...

31:39.460 --> 31:42.720
固执己见  一意孤行了
Boosting car stereos and breaking heads to remember that.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.190
如果我们参加的话...
If we do this deal...

31:53.220 --> 31:55.620
事成之后
After it's done.

31:55.660 --> 31:59.320
你就可以去找莎拉了  如果她还活着
You can look for Sara, if she's alive.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.490
如果我们参加  在我有机会...
If we take this deal, we'll both be dead...

32:01.520 --> 32:03.920
找她之前  我们就都会死的  林肯
Long before I get the chance, Linc.

32:10.790 --> 32:13.390
你们一定有些有权有势的朋友
You guys must have some big-time friends.

32:13.420 --> 32:14.720
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

32:14.760 --> 32:16.120
有人刚刚交了一笔...
Somebody just posted...

32:16.160 --> 32:18.060
数额可观的保释金替你们保释
A significant amount of bail for both of you.

32:18.090 --> 32:19.160
谁
Who?

32:19.190 --> 32:20.920
我不知道  他们在外面
I don't know, but they're outside.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.020
你们可以走了
You're free to go.

32:23.060 --> 32:26.690
拿着  带上你爸爸的文件  里面有我的电话
Here, take your dad's file. My number's inside.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.120
-我们不参加  -拿着吧
-We ain't doing this. -Just take it anyway.

32:29.140 --> 32:30.820
这文件对我来说已经没有用了
This file, it means nothing to me anymore.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.620
布鲁斯·班尼特
Bruce Bennett.

32:53.660 --> 32:55.760
我们走吧
Let's go for a drive.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.540
我以为再也见不到你了
I thought I'd never see you again.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.970
我有东西要给你
I have something for you.

34:43.340 --> 34:45.500
好啊
Okay.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.440
你忘记这个了
You left this behind.

34:55.770 --> 34:58.040
你把玫瑰找回来了
Is that what this is about?

34:58.070 --> 35:00.270
是这个意思吗
You just getting me my rose back?

35:00.300 --> 35:01.900
是的  我想我完成任务了
Yeah. I guess I'm done now.

35:01.940 --> 35:03.100
我可以退休了
I can retire.

35:06.470 --> 35:09.170
你会入狱多久
How much time are you looking at?

35:11.940 --> 35:14.640
他们说要15年
They're saying 15 years.

35:14.670 --> 35:17.700
我得确定一下
I have to find out for sure.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.640
我听林肯说有个什么交易
I heard Lincoln say something about a deal.

35:21.670 --> 35:23.140
不必坐牢
No jail time.

35:23.170 --> 35:26.840
条件是弄跨公司
In exchange for taking down the Company.

35:26.870 --> 35:28.970
如何弄垮
How?

35:30.500 --> 35:33.070
这就是问题所在
Exactly.

35:36.540 --> 35:38.500
我爱你
I love you.

35:38.540 --> 35:41.000
我现在只知道这一点
That's all I know right now.

36:00.300 --> 36:03.670
你难道不会向万能的主屈服吗
"Will you not yield to the immortal gods?"

36:04.640 --> 36:06.070
噩梦不会觉醒
"That nightmare cannot die."

36:06.100 --> 36:07.740
永不休止的罪恶
"Eternal evil itself."

36:07.770 --> 36:10.440
没人能打败她  没有
"There is no fighting her, no."

36:10.470 --> 36:13.170
没有力量能打败她
"No power that can fight her."

36:13.200 --> 36:16.240
听我说  现在由你们自己做主了
Now, listen to me, it's up to you now.

36:16.600 --> 36:19.400
逃跑是最好的办法
"All that avails is flight."

36:37.600 --> 36:40.100
抱歉  我没想吓你
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.270
对不起
I'm sorry.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.100
想跟我聊聊吗
Do you want to talk about it?

37:19.600 --> 37:21.870
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.400
不是
It's not.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.540
告诉我是怎么回事
Tell me what happened.

37:33.340 --> 37:35.270
是公司
It's just the Company.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.700
这就是他们的所作所为
It's just what they do.

37:37.740 --> 37:39.370
不仅是我
It wasn't just me.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.700
上帝  你和LJ...
God, it was you and LJ and-and

37:41.740 --> 37:43.540
还有林肯
Lincoln.

37:45.700 --> 37:48.270
他们不会罢手的
And they won't stop.

37:48.300 --> 37:51.640
我不知道该怎么办
and I don't know how to deal with that.

37:51.670 --> 37:54.070
过来
Hey, come here.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.900
过来  到我这儿来
Come here. Come here.

38:05.300 --> 38:06.600
我们走!
Let's go!

38:23.700 --> 38:25.170
你没事吧
Are you okay?

38:25.200 --> 38:28.340
难以置信他们这么快就找到我们了
I can't believe they found us so fast.

38:28.370 --> 38:30.170
我是不是该打电话给布鲁斯
Should I call, should I call Bruce

38:30.200 --> 38:31.740
叫他找个安全的地方
And-and get some place safe?

38:31.770 --> 38:33.640
没有地方是安全的
No place is safe.

38:33.670 --> 38:35.740
除非我们弄垮公司  否则他们不会罢休的  林肯
They're not gonna stop unless we stop them. Linc?

38:35.770 --> 38:38.370
你和我想的一样吧  让我们结束这一切
You are thinking what I'm thinking? Let's end this.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.470
我不会再次丢下你不管的
But I'm not gonna leave you behind again.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.170
喂
Yeah?

38:49.200 --> 38:50.940
我们加入了
We're in.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.300
你好  兄弟
Hey, papi.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.170
林肯
Linc.

39:07.400 --> 39:10.270
我不知道如何表达你让我加入的感激之情
I can't tell you how grateful I am for you including me.

39:10.300 --> 39:11.900
是苏克雷给你担保的  贝里克
Well, Sucre vouched for you, Bellick.

39:11.940 --> 39:15.670
他说在巴拿马 你是因为他才被抓的
He said you came through...For him down in Panama.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.070
阿历克斯
Alex?

39:17.100 --> 39:19.170
迈克尔
Michael.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.940
你准备好了吗
You ready for this?

39:20.970 --> 39:22.970
是的  我准备好了
Yeah. I am.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.040
我听说惠斯勒的那本鸟类书籍里...
So I hear Whistler's bird book...

39:25.070 --> 39:27.100
有我们要偷的东西的详细资料
Has details about what we need to steal.

39:27.140 --> 39:28.670
是的
Yeah.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.200
你知道在谁手里  对吧
You know who's got it, right?

39:33.670 --> 39:34.840
求你了
Please.

39:34.870 --> 39:36.340
我们会死在这里的
We'll die out here.

39:36.370 --> 39:38.370
谢谢你的钞票  外国佬
Thanks for the cash, gringo.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.600
全程头等服务
First class all the way.

39:45.320 --> 39:48.080
你知道帝博格在哪儿吗
Do we have any idea where T-Bag is?

39:48.120 --> 39:49.850
谁知道那狡猾的家伙在哪
That snake could be anywhere.

39:49.870 --> 39:52.070
在洛杉矶  我们可以像犯人一样思考
When we're in L.A., we can think like convicts.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.270
但却不能那样行事
We just can't act like them.

39:53.290 --> 39:54.270
如果那么做  我们就死定了
If we do, we're done.

39:54.290 --> 39:55.650
显而易见...
It goes without saying...

39:55.680 --> 39:56.950
现在是退出的最后机会
This is your last chance to back out.

39:56.980 --> 39:58.280
因为我无法保证的事情中...
'cause first on the list of things...

39:58.320 --> 40:01.680
最重要的一点就是你们的命
I cannot guarantee you is your safety.

40:03.580 --> 40:05.780
我们偏离原先的初衷...
We're all a long way...

40:05.820 --> 40:07.050
太远了
From where this started.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.250
但我向你保证的是...
But what I can guarantee you...

40:09.280 --> 40:11.180
如果我们成功的话
Is that if we do this thing right.

40:11.220 --> 40:13.980
就距离我们的目标更近了
We'll be close to where it ends.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.320
就是自由
Freedom.

40:16.350 --> 40:18.480
最终的自由
Finally.

40:19.770 --> 40:22.000
你们俩  我们走吧
You two, let's go.

40:23.900 --> 40:26.200
麦克
Hey, Mike?

40:27.470 --> 40:28.600
莎拉怎么样了
What about Sara?

40:32.070 --> 40:34.200
莎拉加入了
Sara's in.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.040
好的  我们明天出发
All right, we're heading out tomorrow.

40:42.070 --> 40:44.500
离开之前我要最后确认一些事
I have to finalize a few things before we go.

40:44.540 --> 40:47.540
不玩阴谋  不耍花招
No games and no stunts.

40:47.570 --> 40:48.870
否则的话  我保证...
Otherwise, I promise...

40:48.900 --> 40:51.000
你会看到我完全不一样的另一面
You're gonna see a whole different side of me.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.100
我们也是
Likewise.

40:53.140 --> 40:54.640
假身份证
Fake IDs.

40:54.670 --> 40:57.240
不错的开始
It's a good start.

40:57.270 --> 41:00.340
但有些东西无法作假
But there are some things you can't fake.

41:00.370 --> 41:01.900
有些东西...
And there are some things...

41:01.940 --> 41:06.100
无法隐藏
You can't hide.

41:06.140 --> 41:08.040
明白我的意思吗
Know what I mean?

41:09.600 --> 41:11.970
你对痛觉的忍受度有多高
How high is your threshold for pain?

41:16.500 --> 41:19.840
你确定不用镇痛剂吗
You sure you don't want a sedative?

41:21.370 --> 41:23.570
现在是最痛的时候了
We're gonna go into the night.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.600
感觉如何
How do you feel?

41:47.640 --> 41:49.100
不知为何  变轻了
Lighter somehow.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.700
我都不知道该如何搞垮公司
Look, I don't know how we're gonna take them down.

41:51.740 --> 41:53.570
我甚至不知道他们的身份
I don't even know who they are.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.770
我只知道一件事...
But I do know one thing...

41:55.800 --> 41:58.870
公司将为他们对你的所作所为付出代价
The Company's gonna pay for what they did to you.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.570
我们走吧
Let's go.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.240
你确定你要加入
You sure you're up for this?

42:03.270 --> 42:04.900
如果我们...
If we can...

42:04.940 --> 42:07.940
能一起的话  是的
do it together, yeah.

42:08.540 --> 42:10.670
-好  -当然
-OK. -Absolutely.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.340
AC-130运输机  他们要干什么...
AC-130? What do they want...

42:18.370 --> 42:20.500
难道让我们跳伞吗
Want us to parachute out of this thing?

42:20.540 --> 42:23.100
那家伙找了空军协助
This guy called in a favor to the Air Force.

42:23.140 --> 42:26.340
我们总不能坐民航飞机  对吧
It's not like we can be flying commercial, you know?

42:29.000 --> 42:32.100
如果你们成功拿到锡拉
If you're successful with obtaining Scylla.

42:32.140 --> 42:35.200
不仅可以免除牢狱之灾  而且你们会为...
You'll not only avoid jail time, but you can take great pride...

42:35.240 --> 42:37.940
铲除对这个国家民主的最大威胁...
In knowing you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat...

42:37.970 --> 42:39.800
而感到自豪
To its own democracy.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.700
如果在执行任务过程中身亡...
If you're killed while doing so...

42:41.740 --> 42:43.540
将会被赋予体面的葬礼
A proper funeral will be provided.

42:43.570 --> 42:46.700
但如果你们试图逃跑...
But if you try to escape...

42:46.740 --> 42:48.340
不但没有葬礼
You will have no funeral.

42:48.370 --> 42:49.700
什么都不会得到
You will have nothing,

42:49.740 --> 42:51.670
你们会被追捕...
And you will be apprehended and buried where...

42:51.700 --> 42:53.170
并被就地处决
We find you.

42:53.200 --> 42:56.340
我衷心希望我们能互相理解
I sincerely hope we understand each other.

42:58.770 --> 43:01.470
你最好信守诺言
You better hold up your end of the deal.

43:01.500 --> 43:02.740
我们走
let's go!

43:21.820 --> 43:24.270
洛杉矶  加利福尼亚
Los Angeles, California.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.910
他们答应您的要求了  将军
They are in projection you asked for, general.

43:39.970 --> 43:41.420
线路安全  说吧
You clear, go ahead.

43:41.740 --> 43:43.150
事情有些复杂了
There has been a complication.

43:43.470 --> 43:45.450
布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德已经被转移到...
Burrows and scofield had been transferred to...

43:45.630 --> 43:47.400
我看过报纸了
I read the newspapers,

43:47.630 --> 43:49.900
你不必告诉我头版头条的新闻
You don't have to tell me what's in the headlines.

43:50.630 --> 43:53.540
他们到底被关在哪座监狱还不得而知
The exact penitary where they are been held is under disclosed.

43:53.990 --> 43:55.900
不过肯定是联邦级的  重型监狱
But you can guarantee it'll be the federal, supremax.

43:56.910 --> 43:57.960
不必再汇报了
No more updates.

43:58.140 --> 44:01.410
干掉他们后再给我电话
Call me when they are dead.

44:02.410 --> 44:04.410
欢迎来到洛杉矶
Welcome to Los angles.

44:04.410 --> 44:07.140
问题是  越狱过不止一次的人...
As it turns out, Men who have escaped not one...

44:07.140 --> 44:11.130
被认为是有一定的潜逃隐患的
But two penitaries are considered as a bit of flight risks.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.670
所以我们需要时刻了解...
So we need to know where you are...

44:12.700 --> 44:14.230
你们的位置和行动
And what you're doing at all times.

44:14.270 --> 44:15.770
这些是脚踝全球定位跟踪器
These are GPS ankle monitors.

44:15.800 --> 44:18.000
现在过来拿一个带上
Now step up, take one and put it on.

44:18.030 --> 44:19.930
我不带
I ain't wearing that.

44:19.970 --> 44:21.930
让我们说清楚
Let's make this clear.

44:21.970 --> 44:23.270
我是你们的盟友
I'm your ally.

44:23.300 --> 44:25.430
但更重要的是  我是你们的老板
But more importantly, I'm your boss.

44:25.470 --> 44:27.770
也就是说  如果这次行动失败
Which means if this fails.

44:27.800 --> 44:30.100
和你们比起来 我会面临更大的麻烦
It's my ass on the line as much If not more than yours,

44:30.130 --> 44:30.870
所以从现在开始
 so from this point on.

44:30.900 --> 44:33.500
我让你们做什么  你们就做什么
If I ask you to do something, you do it.

44:33.530 --> 44:35.030
我让你们说什么
If I ask you to say something.

44:35.070 --> 44:35.970
你们就说什么
You say it.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.870
我让你们带上跟踪器
And if I ask you to put on a monitor.

44:37.900 --> 44:39.670
你们就带上跟踪器
You put on a monitor.

44:59.700 --> 45:02.030
目前为止所有人都认为...
As far as the general public is concerned...

45:02.070 --> 45:06.130
你们被关押在美国境内某个重型监狱里
You're being contained in a supermax facility somewhere In the United States

45:06.170 --> 45:08.030
所以要避免无谓的解释
So to avoid any messy explanations.

45:08.070 --> 45:09.330
避免被公司发现
And stay off the Company's radar.

45:09.370 --> 45:13.400
你们要低调行事并且保持警惕
You need to keep your heads down and your ears open.

45:14.030 --> 45:16.830
我们提供了手机  衣物和洗漱用品
We've provided cell phones, clothing, and toiletries.

45:16.870 --> 45:18.900
所有的基本必需品都已准备好了
All the basic necessities to get you up and running.

45:19.970 --> 45:22.030
你让这些家伙进来之前都搜过身了吧
You patted these guys down before you let them in, right?

45:22.430 --> 45:23.830
我可不想被暗算
Cause I can't be getting shanked or shivved.

45:23.870 --> 45:24.830
他是谁
Who's this?

45:24.870 --> 45:27.030
他是罗兰·格伦
This is Roland Glenn.

45:27.070 --> 45:28.100
他会协助你们
He'll be assisting you.

45:28.130 --> 45:29.300
我们的队伍已经满员了
We've already got our team.

45:29.330 --> 45:31.770
不是  斯科菲尔德  这是我的队伍
No, Scofield, see, this is my team.

45:31.800 --> 45:32.730
罗兰和你们一样...
And Roland's working off...

45:32.770 --> 45:34.070
也要干活来免除牢狱之灾
A sentence just like the rest of you.

45:34.100 --> 45:36.970
事实上  就对锡拉保安的严密程度而言...
In fact, with the amount of security that's gonna be around Scylla...

45:37.070 --> 45:39.170
罗兰的专长是必要的
Roland's expertise will be a necessity.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.230
所以  如果没有其它问题
So, if no more questions.

45:41.270 --> 45:42.700
我们开始寻找锡拉的工作吧
Let's get to work on finding Scylla.

45:42.730 --> 45:43.830
那个第二步怎么办
What about that second step?

45:43.870 --> 45:45.200
闯入的问题呢
What about the break-in?

45:45.230 --> 45:46.670
我来负责第二步  好吗
You let me worry about step two, okay?

45:46.700 --> 45:48.130
你把精力放在寻找锡拉就好
You just worry about finding Scylla.

45:48.170 --> 45:49.800
关于从哪入手  我有个想法
I've got an idea where to start.

45:50.930 --> 45:52.230
非常棒  亚历山大
That's excellent, Alexander.

45:52.270 --> 45:53.700
你瞧  还有人在思考
See, there's a man who's thinking.

45:53.730 --> 45:57.230
好了  大家开始工作吧
All right, let's let these men get to work.

45:57.270 --> 46:00.700
祝我们大家都好运
Good luck, to all of us.

46:02.700 --> 46:04.330
既然我是第一个到的...
Since I was here first I think I'll...

46:04.370 --> 46:07.470
如果大家没意见  那个最舒服的房间就归我了
Just go ahead and grab that S.S. bedroom, if that's cool.

46:07.530 --> 46:09.800
-莎拉  -怎么
-Sara. -Yeah?

46:09.830 --> 46:12.000
那个位置归你
You take the bunk.

46:14.230 --> 46:16.530
当这一切结束以后
You know, when this is, when this is all done.

46:16.570 --> 46:19.830
你和我  我们要做个了断
You and me, we're gonna settle up.

46:25.330 --> 46:26.630
很明显
All right, obviously.

46:26.670 --> 46:29.070
这里的恩怨很多
There's a lot of history in this room.

46:29.100 --> 46:30.430
这显而易见
That's a given.

46:30.470 --> 46:31.530
但如果我们要完成任务
But it we're gonna pull this off.

46:31.570 --> 46:33.470
需要所有人的努力
It's gonna take all of us.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.700
我们要团结一致
We got to work together.

46:34.730 --> 46:37.030
如果谁有问题  现在就说出来
So if anyone has a problem, get it out now.

46:37.070 --> 46:39.000
谁想要和别人解决恩怨...
You want to clear the air with someone...

46:39.030 --> 46:41.870
就是现在了
Now's the time.

46:49.530 --> 46:51.400
好的
All right.

46:51.430 --> 46:52.900
我们开始干活吧
Let's get to work.

46:52.930 --> 46:56.970
惠斯勒的任务是把数据卡...
Whistler's assignment was to drop off this data card...

46:57.200 --> 46:59.400
锡拉交给一名公司高管
This 'Scylla' to a Company Executive.

46:59.430 --> 47:01.570
一个被他称为"持卡者"的人
Someone he referred to as "The Cardholder."

47:01.600 --> 47:03.830
他的任务是保护数据卡
And his job was to-to protect it.

47:03.870 --> 47:06.230
保证它的安全
To keep it safe.

47:06.270 --> 47:09.630
目前  我还不知道他是谁
Now, I didn't see who he was.

47:09.670 --> 47:11.000
不过我见过他的司机
But I got a look at his driver.

47:11.030 --> 47:12.100
他的司机
His driver?

47:12.130 --> 47:13.730
你想描绘这家伙的脸...
You want to sketch this guy's face...

47:13.770 --> 47:16.300
再和一千万洛杉矶人比对吗
And match it up to 10 million people in Los Angeles?

47:16.330 --> 47:17.900
这太有才了
Well, that's just great.

47:17.930 --> 47:19.470
我不仅看到了他的脸
I saw more than just the guy's face.

47:19.500 --> 47:21.730
当其他的司机都在胡扯闲聊的时候
All the drivers were hanging around, talking shop.

47:21.770 --> 47:23.630
但这个家伙  独自站在旁边
But this guy, he was standing by himself.

47:23.670 --> 47:25.070
两腿微分  双手背后
Legs apart, hands behind his back.

47:25.100 --> 47:26.930
静止不动  他是位退伍军人
At rest, he's former military.

47:26.970 --> 47:30.200
他车的底盘比其他的都低
His car rides a little lower than the rest of 'em.

47:30.300 --> 47:32.970
也许是由于注重安全性的...
Probably signifies private security...

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
防弹玻璃增加车身重量的原因
Weighed down by bulletproof siding.

47:35.030 --> 47:37.970
他的衣服  仅凭警察的工资或...
His suit, you don't buy a suit like that...

47:38.030 --> 47:40.870
周末兼职司机的外块  是买不起的
On a cop's salary or pulling weekend gigs as a driver.

47:40.930 --> 47:42.470
说明他是全职
That means he's full-time.

47:42.500 --> 47:43.530
高薪
He's highly paid.

47:43.570 --> 47:47.070
如果请我们的朋友  赛尔夫先生查一下...
You ask our friend Mr. Self to run tax records...

47:47.270 --> 47:49.700
生活在洛杉矶45至55岁之间的...
On the 45- to 55-year-old white males...

47:49.730 --> 47:52.270
领取军方退休金  并且从私人保安公司赚取...
In Los Angeles drawing a military pension...

47:52.300 --> 47:55.300
6位数以上年薪的白人男性税务记录的话...
And taking six figures from a private security company...

47:55.330 --> 47:59.030
就能把范围从1000万人缩小到大概50人
And you narrow your field from 10 million till about 50.

47:59.070 --> 48:01.100
然后我就能从中找出那个家伙了
And then I can pick the guy out from there.

48:03.030 --> 48:06.100
找到司机  就能找到持卡者
Find the driver, you find the Cardholder.

48:09.100 --> 48:12.100
墨西哥沙漠  距美国边境60英里
Mexican Desert, 60 miles south of US border.

48:25.130 --> 48:28.630
我们已经好几天不吃不喝了
We haven't ate or drank anything for days.

48:28.670 --> 48:30.770
我不想死在这里
Oh, I don't want to die out here.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.770
我们不会死的  桑乔
We ain't gonna die, Sancho.

48:34.300 --> 48:36.200
-我们不会死的  -好的
-Hey, hey, we ain't gonna die. -OK

48:36.230 --> 48:37.270
我们只需要找到...
We just gotta find...

48:37.300 --> 48:39.270
那个叫什么  仙人掌指南针就好
What's called, a compass cactus.

48:39.300 --> 48:42.100
因为仙人掌总是向南倾斜的
Due to the fact it always leans toward the south.

48:42.130 --> 48:44.000
里面是鲜美的果肉  我们可以填饱肚子
Inside there's delicious fruit which'll fill our bellies.

48:44.030 --> 48:46.770
而且  我们会知道哪边是南
Plus, we find out which way is south.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.570
我们得找到哪边是北才行
We're gonna find out which way is north.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.530
明白吗
Comprender?

48:52.600 --> 48:54.270
这样吧
Tell you what.

48:54.300 --> 48:57.930
我们在这休息一会如何
Why don't we rest here for a while, huh?

48:57.970 --> 49:00.400
等晚上凉快一点再走
Travel at night when it's cooler.

49:00.430 --> 49:02.670
对  这主意不错
Si, that sounds good.

49:05.530 --> 49:07.570
我们到那之后怎么办
What are we gonna do when we get there?

49:07.600 --> 49:09.400
到圣地亚哥
To San Diego.

49:09.430 --> 49:11.000
你是说等迈克尔为他...
You mean after Michael pays...

49:11.030 --> 49:13.200
对我所做的卑鄙无耻的事付出代价之后吗
For the vile he's transgressed upon me?

49:17.470 --> 49:19.870
我还在考虑这是什么意思
I'm still trying to figure that out.

50:25.300 --> 50:27.400
和国土安全局合作真不错
Nice to work with Homeland.

50:27.430 --> 50:30.730
联邦调查局想得到这些信息得大费周折
The FBI would take days to gather this intel.

50:30.770 --> 50:31.970
联邦调查局该雇用我
Well, the FBI should'a hired me

50:32.000 --> 50:34.670
无论什么资料  我都能在25分钟内搞到手
Cause I could've gotten whatever info you wanted in 25 minutes tops.

50:34.900 --> 50:36.170
你是黑客吗
Are you some kind of hacker?

50:36.200 --> 50:38.700
我以设计硅光刻为生
I design silicon lithography for personal gain.

50:38.730 --> 50:40.070
他是个身份窃贼
He's an identity thief.

50:40.100 --> 50:41.400
他是个蠢货
He's a douche.

50:41.430 --> 50:42.870
你坐一边去
Hey, why don't you sit in the corner.

50:42.900 --> 50:44.270
需要你的时候我们会叫你
And we'll get you when we need you.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.330
就是他
This is him.

50:47.370 --> 50:50.100
他就是那个司机
That's the driver.

50:50.130 --> 50:51.230
现在怎么办
Now what?

50:51.270 --> 50:53.170
他能带我们找到持卡者
Well, he takes us to the Cardholder.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.970
持卡者能带我们找到锡拉
And the Cardholder takes us to Scylla.

51:02.900 --> 51:05.570
你可以把我扔在监狱里不管的
You could have left me there, in jail.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.230
是可以还是应该
Could have or should have?

51:07.270 --> 51:08.800
也许都是
Maybe both.

51:08.830 --> 51:10.330
你是在感谢我吗  阿历克斯
Are you thanking me, Alex?

51:10.370 --> 51:11.900
-我不知道  -别在意了
-I don't know. -Don't bother.

51:11.930 --> 51:13.900
我们是需要你来
You're here because we needed you.

51:13.930 --> 51:15.670
-不是想要你来  -就是他
-Not because we wanted you. -That's him.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.100
就是家伙
That's the guy.

51:29.230 --> 51:31.370
那是什么  看起来像是私人保镖
What's that, looks like private security?

51:34.100 --> 51:36.300
这里就像是城堡一样
It's like a fortress.

51:38.530 --> 51:40.370
慢点  慢点
Slow down, slow down.

51:40.400 --> 51:41.830
我们在找的东西
This thing we gotta get.

51:41.870 --> 51:43.570
在里面吗
It's in there?

51:45.270 --> 51:48.470
运动传感器  警报系统
Motion sensors, alarm systems.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.330
武装保安
Armed guards.

51:52.200 --> 51:55.430
神不知鬼不觉的进去再出来
In and out of that place without anybody knowing.

51:55.530 --> 51:58.300
你最好做个完美的计划  迈克尔
You better have one hell of a plan, Michael.

51:59.830 --> 52:02.270
所以基本上根本无法潜入那个地方
So, basically there's no freaking way to break in to the place.

52:02.300 --> 52:05.100
不可能那么快  不可能不被发现
Not quickly, not without being seen.

52:05.200 --> 52:07.400
周边建筑呢  有什么地方我们可以...
What about the neighbors, somewhere we can be staged from...

52:07.430 --> 52:09.070
挖地道钻过去
You know, go under and up?

52:09.100 --> 52:12.100
最近的一处在这里  路对面
Closest neighbor is here, across the street.

52:12.130 --> 52:14.630
就算这样也要数周时间
And even that would take weeks.

52:14.670 --> 52:17.570
政府放出我们被关押在重型监狱的假消息...
The government's story about us being held in a supermax...

52:17.670 --> 52:19.430
不会隐瞒太久
Will only last so long.

52:19.470 --> 52:20.770
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

52:20.800 --> 52:22.970
我是说  如果有人发现事实怎么办
I mean, then what if somebody finds out we're not.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.470
或许我们不需要闯入那所房子
What if we don't have to be in the house?

52:24.500 --> 52:26.770
如果那个数据卡  锡拉如此重要
If the card, this Scylla is so important.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.370
也许那家伙是随身携带的
Maybe the guy is carrying it on him.

52:28.400 --> 52:29.830
根据政府公共记录
Well, according to public records.

52:29.870 --> 52:31.130
该物业的主人名为斯图亚特·塔克豪恩
The owner of the estate's name is Stuart Tuxhorn.

52:31.170 --> 52:34.870
他是一家名为斯皮克托利姆公司的总裁
And he's a CEO of a company called Spectroleum.

52:34.900 --> 52:37.400
这样的大人物一定是24小时有保镖贴身保护的
Heavy hitter like that's gonna have security 24-7.

52:37.430 --> 52:38.430
我们要在神不知鬼不觉的情况下...
And we gotta get this thing...

52:38.470 --> 52:39.770
把数据卡偷走  对吧
Without anyone knowing it's gone, right?

52:39.800 --> 52:41.970
就算他随身携带  我们如何行事
So even if he's got it on him, how do we get it off him?

52:42.000 --> 52:43.400
我们不必偷走数据卡
You don't steal the card.

52:43.430 --> 52:44.870
复制一份就行
You copy it.

52:50.570 --> 52:53.070
现在你们对我的话感兴趣了  对吧
Oh, now you're interested in what I gotta say, right?

52:54.830 --> 52:56.670
复制一份更难做到
Copying it will make it harder.

52:56.700 --> 52:57.970
不止要偷
Not only do you have to steal it.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.170
而且要还  天才
You have to return it, genius.

52:59.200 --> 53:03.070
有我便不必了  哥们
Only if you don't got me, hombre.

53:04.130 --> 53:05.300
那是什么
What's that?

53:05.330 --> 53:07.630
我就是因为这个被抓的
This is the reason I got busted.

53:07.670 --> 53:08.870
你偷了个手机吗
Oh, you stole the cell phone?

53:08.900 --> 53:10.230
不  不
Oh, yeah, yeah, no.

53:10.270 --> 53:12.870
偷手机就要被关重型监狱  你开玩笑吧
I'm looking at federal time cause I stole a cell phone, seriously?

53:14.600 --> 53:15.570
我发明了这个
I invented this

53:15.600 --> 53:17.130
所以我不必去偷
So that I don't have to steal.

53:17.170 --> 53:20.370
它看起来像是个手机  但实际上它...
It looks like a cell phone but it's really like...

53:20.400 --> 53:21.630
像是个数码黑洞
A digital black hole.

53:21.670 --> 53:24.200
这是可以接受10英尺内所有电子数据的...
Wireless hard drive that swallows up any electronic data...

53:24.230 --> 53:25.330
无线接收器
Within ten feet of it.

53:25.370 --> 53:26.400
比如
Like what?

53:26.430 --> 53:27.670
可以接收在星巴克...
Like the account info...

53:27.700 --> 53:30.230
无线上网的人的帐户信息
Of anyone at Starbucks with a latte and a laptop.

53:30.270 --> 53:33.270
可以接收加油站使用信用卡的顾客的密码
Like the PIN number of any credit card used at a gas pump.

53:33.300 --> 53:35.330
用它我可以轻轻松松的用一只手...
I can walk out of here and get the identities...

53:35.370 --> 53:37.270
在十分钟内得到十个人的...
And financial statements of ten people in ten minutes...

53:37.300 --> 53:39.770
身份及账户信息
On a slow day, with one hand on my junk.

53:41.030 --> 53:43.070
锡拉里面的信息呢
And the information embedded in Scylla?

53:43.100 --> 53:46.370
只要能接近...
If we can get close enough...

53:46.770 --> 53:48.370
就是我们的了
It's ours.

53:50.200 --> 53:54.240
《越狱》第四季 第二集
Prison.Break.S04EE02

54:05.200 --> 54:09.130
这个数目  你能接受吗
Is this number acceptable to you?

54:12.300 --> 54:15.130
1万人
10,000 people?

54:24.270 --> 54:26.830
-可以  -很好
-Yes. -Good.

54:26.870 --> 54:28.270
现在你加入了
Now that you're on board.

54:28.300 --> 54:31.030
我们今天就可以传达行动命令了
We can issue the op-order today.

54:40.210 --> 54:41.440
他上路了
He's on his way.

54:41.480 --> 54:43.610
好的  稍等
All right, hold on.

54:46.640 --> 54:47.880
莎拉  是我
Sara, it's me.

54:47.910 --> 54:49.580
大家都已就绪
Everybody's on.

54:51.140 --> 54:52.480
在我运行装置的时候
Now, while I'm monitoring the device.

54:52.510 --> 54:53.640
我无法知道...
I'm not gonna be able to see...

54:53.680 --> 54:54.710
拷贝的具体内容
Exactly what data's being copied.

54:54.740 --> 54:56.180
但就像从网上下载A片一样
But, like downloading quality porn from the Internet.

54:56.210 --> 55:00.130
进度条会显示什么时候会传输完毕
Progress bar's gonna tell me when it's time to rock and roll.

55:00.180 --> 55:01.880
他们需要待在范围内多久
How long do they need to stay in range?

55:01.910 --> 55:04.680
像这样的加密数据需要至少2分钟
Encrypted data like this is gonna take at least two minutes.

55:04.710 --> 55:06.340
他来了
Here he comes.

55:06.380 --> 55:08.110
苏克雷  该你了
Sucre, you're on.

55:20.110 --> 55:21.680
好运
Good luck.

55:28.940 --> 55:30.780
先生  您可否不要靠近车
Sir, would you mind stepping away from the vehicle?

55:31.780 --> 55:33.340
怎么样了  罗兰
Talk to me, Roland.

55:33.380 --> 55:34.580
我什么都没收到  伙计
I got nothing, man.

55:34.610 --> 55:36.310
上次我这么努力的还是在...
Last time I had this little action...

55:36.340 --> 55:37.840
艰难的通过五年级考试的时候
I was dry humping my way through fifth grade.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.180
冷静点
Calm down.

55:40.210 --> 55:41.810
先生
Sir.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.340
先生
Sir.

55:43.380 --> 55:44.840
离车远点
Step away from the vehicle!

55:44.880 --> 55:47.640
好的  哥们  放松点  我们不必如此激动
Okay, bro, just relax, we don't have to get all excited.

55:47.680 --> 55:48.780
现在你会说英语了
You speak English now.

55:48.810 --> 55:50.410
只会一点  但是...
Only a little, but...

55:50.440 --> 55:52.540
现在怎么样了
How about now?

55:52.580 --> 55:53.580
不行
Nada.

55:53.610 --> 55:55.110
试着再靠近一点儿
Try to get closer to them.

55:55.140 --> 55:57.740
再靠近  他就得进车里了
If he was any closer, he'd be in the car.

55:59.240 --> 56:00.640
我知道你的小把戏了  混蛋
I get your little act, Pedro.

56:00.680 --> 56:01.910
故意撞车
Hit the brakes.

56:01.940 --> 56:04.440
让有钱人赔钱  你就不用修车了
let the rich guy pay for damage you don't intend to fix.

56:06.740 --> 56:10.280
给他点钱我们好走
Just give the man some money so we can leave.

56:15.810 --> 56:17.280
恭喜你
Congratulations.

56:25.280 --> 56:27.040
他在那  我想塔克豪恩在车里
He was there, I think Tuxhorn was in the car.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.140
-我们到底收到没有  -没有
-So did we get it or not? -Nope.

56:29.180 --> 56:30.480
什么都没有
Nothing.

56:42.410 --> 56:45.110
我能效劳吗
Can I help you?

56:46.810 --> 56:48.680
你怎么找到我的
So how did you find me?

56:48.710 --> 56:50.340
我一直在跟踪你
I never lost you.

56:50.380 --> 56:52.940
新鼻子让我有点吃惊  但是...
The, uh, the new nose threw me a bit, but...

56:52.980 --> 56:54.710
你想要什么  当
What do you want, Don?

56:54.740 --> 56:56.110
我还有客人
I got customers.

56:56.140 --> 56:59.380
从前  你和公司合作的时候...
Look, back in the days, when you worked with the Company.

56:59.410 --> 57:00.410
为公司卖命
Well, for the Company.

57:00.440 --> 57:01.910
我负责公司的经营预测
I did economic forecasts of their operations.

57:01.940 --> 57:03.680
我是说  我不是那些人中的一员...
I mean, I wasn't one of the guys...

57:03.710 --> 57:04.680
但你有人脉
But you had access.

57:04.710 --> 57:06.310
得了吧  上次我帮你
Come on, the last time I helped you.

57:06.340 --> 57:07.780
除了花10万美金做个手术以外...
The only thing I got out of it...

57:07.810 --> 57:10.140
我什么都没有得到
Was plastic surgery and a $100,000 pay cut.

57:10.180 --> 57:14.080
所以  要么你买一辆大马力的顶级豪华车
so either you buy one of these exceptional family cars

57:14.110 --> 57:15.780
要么你就滚蛋
Or you leave me the hell alone.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.480
我知道锡拉的事
I know about Scylla

57:18.580 --> 57:20.140
而且我在找它
And I'm going after it.

57:21.340 --> 57:23.440
我知道你很疯狂
You know, I knew you were crazy.

57:23.480 --> 57:24.910
但不知道你也很蠢
I didn't know you were stupid, too.

57:24.940 --> 57:27.580
假如说我能拿到数据卡
Well, let's just say I was able to get hands on it.

57:27.610 --> 57:29.510
据我理解  锡拉只有在插在...
It's my understanding that Scylla could only be used...

57:29.540 --> 57:31.410
藏在公司内部某处的...
If it's plugged into a decoder box...

57:31.440 --> 57:33.040
解码器上才能被读取
That's hidden in one of the Company facilities.

57:33.080 --> 57:34.080
我说的对吗
Am I right?

57:34.110 --> 57:35.540
我希望我能帮忙
You know, I wish I could help.

57:35.580 --> 57:36.940
但我爱莫能助
but I can't.

57:36.980 --> 57:38.280
不  你会帮忙的  贾斯帕
No, you are helping, Jasper.

57:38.310 --> 57:40.880
问题只是在我把你当着同事的面...
Just a matter of whether you do it before or after...

57:40.910 --> 57:42.940
羞辱一番之前还是之后罢了
I shame you in front of your coworkers here.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.240
告诉我公司把解码器藏在哪  贾斯帕
Tell me where the Company keeps the box, Jasper.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.310
可能在任何地方  我不知道
Could be anywhere, I don't know.

57:51.340 --> 57:52.840
总有人知道吧
Somebody does.

57:52.880 --> 57:53.840
对吧
Right?

57:53.880 --> 57:55.840
你认识的某个人
Somebody that you might have access to.

57:56.010 --> 57:57.380
如果你一意孤行
You know, if you go down this road.

57:57.410 --> 57:59.180
你的政府职位也保不了你
Your government job won't protect you.

57:59.210 --> 58:01.940
那我最好别被抓住  对吧
Then I better not get caught, right?

58:01.980 --> 58:04.640
如果我不快点找到些吃的
If I don't find something to eat soon.

58:04.680 --> 58:06.780
我真不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

58:06.810 --> 58:08.080
我们撑不过去的
We're not gonna make it.

58:09.540 --> 58:11.180
我们得不停的说话  桑乔
We just got to keep talking, Sancho.

58:11.210 --> 58:13.640
把注意力从饥饿的肚皮和...
Keep our brains focused on something other than...

58:13.680 --> 58:16.710
干裂的嘴唇上转移开  好吗
Our empty bellies and our dry mouths, okay?

58:16.740 --> 58:17.980
来吧
Come on.

58:18.010 --> 58:20.880
从你最喜欢的颜色说起
Let's start with, uh, your-your favorite color.

58:26.840 --> 58:28.880
你他妈的在干嘛
Hell you doing?!

58:30.110 --> 58:31.240
我太饿了  泰迪
I'm hungry, Teddy.

58:31.280 --> 58:32.580
与其我们两个都死在这
Why should the both of us die out here.

58:32.610 --> 58:34.710
不如一个人牺牲自己  成全对方
When one of us could help the other one survive?

58:35.080 --> 58:37.540
你不该这样做  拜托
You don't want to do this. Please.

58:37.580 --> 58:39.740
我会给你个痛快的  我保证
I'll make it quick. I promise!

58:43.410 --> 58:45.780
桑乔
Sancho.

58:50.840 --> 58:52.610
桑乔
Sancho!

58:52.640 --> 58:56.910
你为什么非要做这样的...
Why'd you have to go and do something so...

59:34.880 --> 59:36.880
这么说塔克豪恩没把卡带在身上
So Tuxhorn doesn't keep the card on him.

59:36.910 --> 59:38.140
一定在里面  对吧
It must be in there, right?

59:41.540 --> 59:42.880
听着  想要潜进房子而不被发现...
Look, there's no way we're getting...

59:42.910 --> 59:44.440
是不可能的
In that house without being seen.

59:44.480 --> 59:45.880
我知道
I know.

59:45.910 --> 59:48.110
如果卡在房子里  我们如何拷贝
Well, if the card's in there, how we gonna copy it?

59:48.140 --> 59:49.080
不是我们
We're not.

59:49.110 --> 59:52.010
她替我们做
She's gonna do it for us.

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:09.440
在看什么呢
What're you reading?

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.380
没人能打败她
"There is no fighting her."

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:13.110
没有力量能打败她
"No power can fight her.

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:16.240
飞行是最好的办法
"All that avails is flight."

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.040
这是荷马的...
That's homer...

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.340
《奥德赛》中的片段
That's from The Odyssey.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.340
-这些是我父亲文件中的东西  -是的
-Is this from my father's folder? -Yeah.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.580
这也解释了为何锡拉听起来这么耳熟
And it explains why Scylla sounded so familiar.

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.580
如果我没弄错的话  这是书中...
If I'm not mistaken, it's from that chapter in the book...

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:27.610
奥德赛被告知...
Where Odysseus is told...

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.280
他要勇敢的面对一个叫锡拉的妖怪
He has to confront a monster known as Scylla.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.480
他为什么要写这个
Wonder why he wrote this down.

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.310
我说的不一定正确  但我相信...
I could be wrong, but I believe...

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.880
奥德塞斯被告知...
Odysseus is told that in order to...

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:41.040
要继续前行  打倒锡拉...
Continue on his path, to pass Scylla...

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.040
必须牺牲他的六名手下
It'll require the sacrifice of six of his men.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.980
否则他只有放弃他的旅途
His only other alternative is to abandon his path.

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:50.680
他选择了牺牲手下
And he chooses to make the sacrifice.

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:54.210
真是个艰难的选择
Well, it's a hell of a choice.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.780
我不知道我能否做出选择
One I'm not sure I'm comfortable making.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:07.310
莎拉  关于明天女佣的那个计划
Sara, um, about tomorrow the plan, the housekeeper.

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:11.410
如果你为难的话
If you're not up to it.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.480
不  不  我可以
No, no, I am.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.480
芝加哥  伊利诺斯州
Chicago, Illinois.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.980
告诉我
Tell me.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:30.940
克劳迪娅·毛里西奥是位好室友吗
Is Claudia Mauricio a good roommate?

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.310
是个好人吗
A good person?

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.440
我希望她也是这么看你的
I hope she feels the same about you.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.680
谢尔碧  你不会相信路上的交通...
Oh, Shelby, you wouldn't believe the traffic on the...

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:58.240
你应该保持安静
You'll want to be quiet now.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.910
克劳迪娅.
Claudia.

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.880
狱政局的某些机密资料
There are levels of clearance at the Department of Corrections.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.410
是无法触及到的
That are simply not available.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.680
即使我的那些无所不能的朋友也一样
Even for friends as connected as mine.

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:10.710
所以  仔细听好了
So, listen carefully.

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:15.080
如果对你的朋友的性命还有些许怜悯的话
If you even remotely value your friend's life.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.210
你就用你的安全密码进入...
You're going to use your security code to access...

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.510
罪犯的转监记录
The records for prisoner transfers.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.310
告诉我迈克尔·斯科菲尔德...
And tell me where they sent...

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.840
和林肯·布鲁斯被送到哪了
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.080
我帮你拿吧
I can take that for you.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.080
-谢谢  -不客气
-Thanks. -Sure.

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.140
你的包真不错
That's a great bag.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.480
你从哪买的啊
Can I ask you where you got it?

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:07.710
是老板送我的礼物
It was a gift from my boss.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.640
所以我也不知道  不好意思
So I don't really know, sorry.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.280
没关系  谢谢了
Sure, thanks.

01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:12.340
给你
There you go.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.640
我从来都买不到合适的包
I can never find a good bag.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.980
我是位老师  总要带很多书和卷子...
I'm a teacher, and I have books and grading materials and...

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.910
我也许该买一个...
I should probably go ahead and just invest...

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.110
像你那样的大包
In a wagon one of these days.

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:25.210
是的  所以我喜欢这个包
Yeah, that's why I love this bag.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.240
有很多小口袋
It has so many pockets.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.910
我能看一下吗
Do you mind if I take a look?

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.240
当然可以
Oh, no.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.740
谢谢
Thanks.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.980
感谢上帝  感谢上帝
Ah, thank God, thank God.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.480
你没事吧  先生
You all right, mister?

01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:00.880
是的  我那破车在几英里外抛锚了
Yeah, my damn truck blew a gasket a few miles back.

01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:03.140
之后我一路步行过来的
I've been, uh, hoofing it ever since.

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.380
你要到哪去
Where you headed?

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:06.510
圣地亚哥
San Diego.

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:09.280
如果你想的话  我们可以载你一程
Hell, we can give you a ride, if you'd like.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.910
你没事吧  伙计
Hey, what's wrong, man?

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.110
吃了墨西哥的烂食物了吗
Eat some bad Mexican?

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.110
差不多吧
Something like that.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.310
跟昨天一样  很准时
Same as yesterday, right on schedule.

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:33.510
希望那东西还在她的包里
I hope to hell she's still got that thing in her purse.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.480
塔克豪恩家
Tuxhorn residence.

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.040
你好  我是保安公司的
Hello, I'm from the alarm company.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.910
我们从您家里接收到一些...
We've been receiving some, uh...

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.980
奇怪的信号
Strange signals from your property.

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:48.740
请您检查一下窗户好吗
We'd like you to check the windows, please.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:51.280
确保所有的警报装置都运行正常
Make sure all the contacts are still active.

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:52.480
所有的窗户
All the windows?

01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:53.810
是的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.210
房子里的每个房间
Every room in the house.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.410
好的  稍等
Okay, hold on.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.840
她还带着包吗
Does she still have the bag?

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.140
是的
Yeah.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.610
收到信号了
She's got it.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.040
我正在接受房间里的所有信号  伙计
I'm picking up all kinds of gak from the house, man.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.640
小玩意  也许是数码相机  mp3播放器
Small stuff, maybe a digital camera, an MP3 player.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.580
还没有我们要找的东西
Nothing of the size of what we're looking for, though.

01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:21.680
让她继续走
Keep her moving.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:22.810
目前为止还不错  夫人
So far, so good, ma'am.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.040
请您去下一个房间
Uh, please move on to the next room.

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:31.110
怎么样了
How we doing?

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.410
还没找到
Still don't got it.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.810
如果卡在那里
If the card's in there.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.580
就该藏在安全的地方  比如保险箱
It'd be in some kind of, a safe.

01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:39.910
办公室
Office.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.040
夫人  我们的系统显示...
Ma'am, our system is showing...

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.340
故障来自一间像是...
That the malfunction is coming from a room...

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:46.380
办公室或书房的房间
That's designated as, uh, an office or a den.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:47.510
你说的是图书馆吗
You mean the library?

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.180
先生不喜欢我去那里
Mister doesn't like me going in there.

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:51.610
如果您没有设置好警报系统便下班回家的话...
Well, I think he'd like it even less if you went home...

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.710
我想他会更加不高兴  您认为呢
Without properly setting the alarm first, don't you think?

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.340
好吧  我去检查一下
All right, I'll check.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.110
有信号了
We got something.

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.140
是卡吗
The card?

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.380
是的
Oh, yeah.

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:06.780
这么大的文件不可能是其他东西
File's so big it can't be anything else.

01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:07.940
现在你要把她留在那里2分钟...
Now you just gotta keep her there...

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:09.510
保证完成数据传输
For two minute while it finishes the burn.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.210
拖住她  我们需要2分钟
Stall her, we need two minutes.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.480
夫人  我想我们找到问题所在了
Ma'am, I think we found the source of our problem.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:14.080
如果你能...
If you could just stay...

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:15.710
在我们重启系统的过程中...
At that particular window and hold it closed...

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.080
把窗户关上  保持紧闭  问题就能解决了
While we reset the system, that should do it.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.710
怎么样了  罗兰
Talk to me, Roland.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.510
马上就好  马上  马上
It's almost there, almost, almost.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.410
快  快  快
Come on, come on, come on.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.580
快
Come on.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.580
-完成了  -完成了
-Got it. -Got it.

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:51.110
好了  夫人  非常感谢您的帮助
All right, ma'am, thank you so much for your help.

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:00.440
我们现在要做的是...
All we need to do now, man, is just...

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.580
不  她又回去了
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, she's heading back inside.

01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:05.340
-回去干嘛  -我不知道
-What for? -I don't know.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.680
不
Oh, no.

01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:11.840
不  没事
No, we're good.

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:14.310
她出来了
She's out.

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.110
站住
Hey, stop it!

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.510
在这等着
Wait here.

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.840
为了抓不到你  我不得不放慢脚步
I actually had to slow down not to catch you.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.980
我想我的腿拉伤了
I think I pulled a groin.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.010
不在包里
It's not in the bag.

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:53.710
-不在这里  -怎么会不在这里
-It's not here. -How could it not be in here?

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.580
那个接收器  不在包里  给我
The device, it's not here, give me it.

01:07:58.310 --> 01:08:00.210
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:05.180
美国联邦监狱  利文斯顿  德克萨斯州
US Federal Penitentiary, Livingston, Texas.

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:09.340
26  27  28
twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight.

01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:35.240
请讲
Go ahead.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.110
在布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德...
Before Burrows and Scofield...

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.440
被转移到阿灵顿之前
Were allegedlly transferred to Arlington.

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.240
有人替他们付了保释金
Someone posted their bail.

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.780
我要知道这个人是谁
I need to know who.

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:44.280
我查到是一个叫布鲁斯·班尼特的人
I'm showing a Bruce Bennett.

01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:46.810
弗兰克·唐克雷蒂州长的前任助手
Former aid to Governor Frank Tancredi.

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.110
你们觉得那东西掉了吗
You think it fell out?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.410
我们找遍了
We looked everywhere.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.140
你们认为复制成功了吗
You think we got the thing copied?

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.510
我说了  在成功下载数据之前...
Like I said, I can't read the content...

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.610
我对内容也不得而知  但是...
Without downloading the device, but...

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.740
除非塔克豪恩录制了5万个小时的节目
Unless this Tuxhorn's got, like, a 50,000-hour Tivo.

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:15.040
否则的话  肯定是拷贝下来了
Then, yeah, I think we got it.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.810
除非找到接收器  否则是否拷贝下来毫无意义
Doesn't matter if we got it if we can't find it.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.510
接收器到底在哪
Where the hell is it?

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.240
还在房子里
It's still inside the house.

01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:23.680
这就是女佣回去的原因
That's why the maid went back inside.

01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:24.740
她一定发现了
She must have found it.

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:26.040
以为那是她老板的东西
Assumed it belonged to her boss.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.310
所以她就送回去了
And then she left it behind.

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.010
你们猜如何  伙计们  游戏结束了
Well, then guess what, fellas, it's game over.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.110
你知道我为了做那个东西...
You know how many months...

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.640
花费了多少时间吗  迈克尔
It took me to make that thing, Michael?

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.180
怎么  你以为我几秒钟就能再做一个出来吗
What, you just think I can whip up another one in a couple seconds?

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:35.380
丢了不是问题
Losing it is not the problem.

01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:37.280
如果他们发现了  那才是问题
If they find it, that's the problem.

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:40.280
如果他们发现有人在找数据卡  我们就完了
If they find out someone was after that card, we're done.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:42.710
完了是什么意思  你说什么呢
What do you mean, done?  What does that mean?

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.010
意思是说我们要回去蹲监狱了
Does that mean we're gonna go back to prison?

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.080
还是他们要干掉我们
Are they gonna kill us?

01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:46.940
-到底是什么意思  -闭嘴
-What the hell does that mean? -Shut up!

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.740
意味着我们要进去把它取回来
Means we go in and get it.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.640
如果我们有几天时间  就能找到解决的办法
If we had a few days, we'll figure out a way to pull this off.

01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:03.610
但我猜我们没有那么多时间了
But I gather we don't have that kind of time.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.110
是的  你猜的没错
Yeah, you gather right.

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:06.710
听着  如果你想要我们把接收器拿回来
Look, if you want us to get that device out of there.

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.840
你就得有所作为
You gotta throw us a bone.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.640
给我们些额外的帮助
Give us some extra help.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.180
你的要求  需要牵扯到其他的人
What you're asking for requires involving additional people.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.040
那样我们的行动便会暴露
Which given the covert nature of this operation.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.140
我做不到
I cannot do.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.440
那你的要求便是可望不可及
Then you're asking for the impossible.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.110
不  我的要求是努力  明白吗
No, what I'm asking for is competence, okay?

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.980
我不会把整个任务的成功与否...
I'm not the one who put the entire mission...

01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:21.610
寄托在一个该死的女佣身上
In the hands of a damn maid.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.180
听着  如果公司先找到锡拉的拷贝
Look, if the Company finds that copy of Scylla before we do.

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:30.340
那就完了  迈克尔  这是场竞赛
That's it, Michael, that's ball game.

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:31.910
他们会找出幕后的人
They're gonna find out who was behind it.

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:34.080
他们会干掉我们所有人
And they're going to ghost us.All of us.

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:35.810
你没事吧
Are you okay?

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.780
没事
Yeah.

01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:42.680
我没事
I'm fine.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.210
听着  我并不是手握你的把柄...
Look, I didn't choose you to do this

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.380
逼着你做这个的
Because I had you in custody.

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:48.980
我是因为相信你的能力才让你做的
I chose you to do this.Because I believed you could pull it off.

01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:51.310
是的  在过去的几个月里...
Yeah, well, a lot of people have believed in me...

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:53.610
许多人都信任我  赛尔夫特工
In the last few months, Agent Self.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.340
他们都死了
Not all of them are alive today.

01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:01.510
你到底能不能把接收器拿回来
Can you get me back the device or not?

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:07.440
好了  事情是这样的
All right, this is what we got.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.040
在女佣离开的时候  她发现了接收器
The housekeeper saw the device as she was leaving the house.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.910
然后她回到房子里15秒钟
Then she disappears back inside for 15 seconds.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.940
那么我们就知道它的位置了
So, we know, wherever it is.

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.140
在门口附近
It's somewhere close to the door.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.440
所以15秒钟
So, 15 seconds.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.310
就是我们要争取到的时间
That's all we have to buy ourselves.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.640
我不确定我们可以多么接近房子
Listen, I'm not sure how close we're gonna get to this house.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.540
更别说潜入进去了
Let alone inside of it.

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.810
即便我们做到了
But let's say that we do.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.580
房子配备的警报器会在任何窗户或门被...
The alarm they got installed in this house is triggered...

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.580
非法闯入后的1.2秒发出警报
1.2 seconds after broken contact in any door or window.

01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:32.040
之后47个全副武装的...
Which would immediately send the private security guards...

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.240
私人保镖便会立即冲入房子
With their 47 guns rushing into the property.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.880
30秒之后  保安公司...
And after 30 seconds, the alarm company...

01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:37.180
就会派车过去
Will dispatch vehicles to the property.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:38.710
三到四辆  视情况而定
Three to four, depending on availability.

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.980
证实有人非法闯入之后
After confirmation of a break-in.

01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.340
他们会派更多的车来
They'll dispatch additional vehicles.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:44.740
封闭房子的所有出入口
To seal off any and all exits from the property.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.740
我不确定是否能行  迈克尔
I don't know about this, Michael.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.810
现在很明显...
It's getting pretty clear...

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.840
他们为什么要找一帮罪犯来干这件事了
Why they hired a bunch of cons to do this job.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.980
他们不仅想要置身度外
It's not because they wanted it off the books.

01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:52.240
同时我们是毫无价值的
It's because we're expendable.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.680
谁会在乎一帮罪犯被杀呢
Who's gonna care if a bunch of crooks wind up dead?

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:56.710
这是自杀行为
It's suicide.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.480
我会继续查看可能有用的信息
I'm gonna keep looking and see what I can find.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.840
奥德赛的片段
That quote from The Odyssey.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.140
怎么了
What about it?

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.380
有一句不懂
I can't shake that line.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:12.540
飞行是最好的办法
"All that avails is flight."

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.980
如果飞行是唯一的选择怎么办  林肯
What if flight is our only option, Linc?

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.580
如果我们的父亲在调查了...
What if our father after everything he discovered...

01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:22.180
公司的一切之后  发现...
About the Company, what...

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.610
发现飞行是唯一的办法
What if that's what he finally realized?

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.940
知道吗  我记得关于爸爸最清楚的事...
You know, uh, the one thing I remember most...

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.110
就是他的背影
About Dad was the back of his head.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.080
总是渐渐消失在大门口
Always walking out the front door.

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:34.380
总是在逃避着什么
Always running from something.

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:36.780
妈妈  我们  他自己
Mom, us, himself.

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.480
但是他唯一没有逃避的事情...
But the one thing he never ran away from...

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:42.440
就是公司一定得被搞垮的信念
Was his belief that the Company needed to be taken down.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.680
我们现在有机会去完成这个信念
And we got an opportunity to do that.

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:46.940
那么这是我们的战斗  不是他们的
Then this is our fight, not theirs.

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:50.010
兄弟  这不是福克斯河监狱
Man, this ain't Fox River.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.680
他们自己选择来这里
These guys chose to be here.

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:55.010
记住这点
Remember that.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.640
他们自己的选择
They got a choice.

01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:40.610
-快了  -准备好了吗
-Almost. -Ready?

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.220
走
Go.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.410
走
Go.

01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:16.680
快走  快走  快走
Let's go! Let's go! Go!

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:23.200
声音从哪传来的
Where's it coming from?

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.600
街对面的
It's across the street.

01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:31.210
快  我们走
Come on, let's go.

01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:45.980
走
Go.

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:58.440
是街对面的问题
Just something across the street.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.140
我们派人过去检查了
We got a team checking it out now.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.910
您可以回去了  先生
You can go back inside, sir.

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:15.440
他们一定是出城了
Must be out of town.

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.140
爸爸  没事吧
Daddy, is everything okay?

01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:36.880
阿历克斯
Alex.

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.540
谢谢  吉姆
Thanks, Jim.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:42.240
阿历克斯
Alex.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.010
我们快走
Let's go.

01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:15.580
走
Go!

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.640
别回头
Don't turn around.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:31.840
除非你想在漫长的时间内...
Unless you'd like to experience a great deal of pain...

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.080
品尝漫长折磨的滋味
Over an even greater length of time.

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:37.180
你想要什么  随便拿
You-you know, just-just take whatever you want here.

01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:38.680
我唯一想要的东西
The only thing I want from you.

01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:42.980
布鲁斯  是一个简单的问题的答案
Bruce, is the answer to a simple question.

01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:45.580
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德和林肯·布鲁斯在哪
Where are Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows?

01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:47.680
我只是通过报纸知道的...
I only know what-what I read in the papers and...

01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:48.680
三天前
Three days ago.

01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:52.640
美国德克萨斯州利文斯顿的联邦监狱里...
There were 105 inmates in the supermax wing...

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.010
关押着105名囚犯
Of the U.S. penitentiary in Livingston, Texas.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.840
那两兄弟本该被送到那里
Where the brothers were allegedly sent.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.880
但那里还是只关押着105名囚犯
There are still 105 inmates there.

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:04.940
那段时间里没人被释放
And no one has been released during that time.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:08.880
有人在导演一场骗局  布鲁斯
Someone is playing a shell game, Bruce.

01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:12.380
我只是要找出幕后主使
I'm just trying to find out who.

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:14.610
我没有刑事司法管辖权
I have no criminal jurisdiction over.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.210
我知道你把他们保释出来了
I know you bailed them out.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.080
我知道你一直跟莎拉·唐克雷蒂有联系
I know you've been in contact with Sara Tancredi.

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:24.180
我发誓  我真的不知道他们在哪
I swear to you, I've no idea where they are.

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.780
我们走着瞧
I guess we'll see about that.

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.340
祝你好运  泰迪
Good luck, Teddy.

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:39.410
有你们这样的朋友  还需要好运气吗
Who needs luck when you got friends like you fellas, huh?

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.380
我把这份旧报纸带走  你们不介意吧
Hey, you mind if I take this old newspaper of yours with me?

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.640
没问题
No problem.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.310
对你的朋友我很遗憾  朋友
Sorry to hear about your friend, dude.

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:51.080
没关系
It's all right.

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:52.610
他活的很有价值
He had a full life.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:54.710
再见  泰迪
Later, Teddy.

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:12.840
开始吧
There you go.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.510
36
Thirty-six.

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.680
24
Twenty-four.

01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:37.080
36
Thirty-six.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.610
拿到了吗
Did you get it?

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.480
确认一下是否有我们要的数据
Let's make sure we got what we wanted.

01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:26.940
-林肯  -怎么
-Linc. -Yeah.

01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:28.740
看好那东西
Don't let that thing out of your sight.

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.440
好的
All right.

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:33.340
我们胜利在望了
We're halfway there.

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.480
我们只是进到房子里  拿走东西
All we got to do is that little B and E.

01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:36.610
然后我们就离开这里
And we're out of here.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.610
提醒我  我还得去联系赛尔夫...
Reminds me, I need to get ahold of Self...

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.810
看我们时候能开始
See when we can get started.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.240
这一切结束之后你有什么打算
So what are you gonna do when all this is over?

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.840
问的好
That's a good question.

01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.040
兄弟  不管锡拉是什么
Brother, whatever this Scylla thing is.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.880
它就是一堆乱码
It is a monster of a code.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.880
不
No.

01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:15.210
莎拉  我本想来问问你是否想跟我谈谈...
Sara, I was gonna come down here and ask if you...

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:19.210
发生在巴拿马的事情
Wanted to talk some more about what happened in Panama.

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.080
但我想我已经知道你的答案了
But, um, I think I already know what you're gonna say.

01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:25.180
为什么
How's that?

01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:28.280
因为你和我有些相似
Because you're a little like me.

01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:31.840
你会说你没事  你能处理好
Because you're gonna say you're fine, that you can handle it.

01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:34.440
所以...
So, um...

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.110
我就不问了
I'll just leave it at this.

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:40.010
我会陪你
I'm here.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.910
无论什么时候你想说了  我都愿意听
Whenever you want to talk, I'm here.

01:21:45.010 --> 01:21:46.610
谢谢
Thank you.

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:54.980
当我被抓的时候  唯一令我...
You know that the only thing that kept me alive.

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:58.080
坚持下去的信念就是能和你在一起
When I was being held was the thought of being with you.

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.510
我知道如果我有什么三长两短
But I also knew that if anything happened to me.

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.210
你就会责怪你自己
You were gonna blame yourself.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.080
整个下半生都会沉浸在深深的自责当中
You would spend the rest of your life punishing yourself for it.

01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:09.780
我想都不敢想
And, I can't bear the thought of that.

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:17.640
所以我们现在算是扯平了好吗
So can we make a deal right now that we're even.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:22.740
往事一笔勾销  没有自责  没有责任
And just wipe the slate clean and no guilt and no responsibility?

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.940
如果我们还能在一起
If we're gonna be together.

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:27.240
我不希望你是出于为我负责的态度
I don't want it to be out of a sense of obligation.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.140
即使我们应该这样
Or-or even that we should be.

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.680
因为我们经历了太多
Because of what we've been through.

01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:36.610
我只想重新开始
I just want to start over.

01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:39.440
重新开始
Start over.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.340
好的
Okay.

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:45.640
这是否意味着我必须先离婚呢
But, does that mean I have to divorce my wife?

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.780
你和那个俄罗斯脱衣女郎还是合法夫妻
Because you're still married to a Russian stripper.

01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:52.680
第一  我之前一直比较忙
Well, "A": I've been a little busy.

01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:55.680
第二  我很确定她是捷克人
And "B": I'm pretty sure she was Czech.

01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:57.610
迈克尔
Hey, Michael.

01:22:58.780 --> 01:22:59.840
怎么了
What's wrong?

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.680
不管它是什么  反正不对
Whatever it is, it ain't it.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:02.680
我不明白
I don't understand.

01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:04.540
我记得你说过  我们拷贝了那张卡
I thought you said we copied the card.

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:05.610
是  没错
No, we did.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.210
但根据加密编码...
But according to the encryption code...

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.380
我该怎么解释呢
Okay, how do I make this clear?

01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:13.480
假如说锡拉是块披萨  我们得到的只是一片
If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got's a slice.

01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:15.580
剩下的数据在哪
So where's the rest of the data?

01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:16.880
我不知道  我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:17.980
我是说...
I mean...

01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:20.610
我不知道我们为什么看不全
I mean, I don't know how we didn't see this coming.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:21.680
应该是完全没有问题的
I mean, it-it makes perfect sense.

01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:23.410
这就像是核武发射码
It's like the nuclear launch codes.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.580
信息不可能只在一个人的手里
You don't give all that information to just one person.

01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:27.080
那会分给多少人
How many do you give it to?

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:28.810
你父亲记录的奥德赛的那个片段说...
Okay, that quote your father held onto...

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.310
锡拉是一只六头妖怪
In The Odyssey Scylla is a six-headed monster.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.110
想要通过就需要牺牲6位手下的生命
That requires a sacrifice of six soldiers in order to pass.

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.010
这么说锡拉不只是一张卡
So Scylla isn't one card.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.310
是六张
It's six.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.410
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.410
我们如何能找到剩下的5张
How we gonna find five more of these things?

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.580
迈克尔  迈克尔
Michael! Michael!

01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:00.810
我很忙
I'm busy.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.280
我不在乎她现在怎么样了
I don't care what she looks like.

01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:05.180
三勺水
Three tablespoons of water.

01:24:05.210 --> 01:24:07.040
一勺蜂蜜
one of honey.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.210
就这些
Nothing more.

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.880
即使她只知道哪怕是一点点的消息
If she knows something about anything that's going on.

01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:16.080
我也要知道
I'm going to find it.

01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:21.510
起床了  婊子
Rise and shine, bitch.

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.340
吃早餐
Breakfast.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:01.640
迈克尔
Michael?

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.740
迈克尔
Hey, Michael!

01:25:05.610 --> 01:25:07.380
你没事吧
You all right?

01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:09.880
没事  我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:11.740
这些保护措施让你不禁联想...
All this security makes you wonder...

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:12.780
公司到底在隐藏什么
What the Company's hiding.

01:25:12.810 --> 01:25:13.880
弄清真相的唯一办法就是...
Only way to know for sure...

01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:16.210
找到剩余的5张数据卡
Is to find those five other cards,

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.610
我们自己看
See for ourselves.

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.710
我们的时间够吗
Think we'll have enough time?

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.140
够
Yeah.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:23.640
我们...
We'll, uh...

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.340
会没事的
We'll be fine.
