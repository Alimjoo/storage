莎拉·唐克雷蒂 你了解吗?

如果你能把我调到隔离监狱  我对她的了解会更深
I'd know her a lot better if you can get my ass moved.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.560
我会跟狱长商量看
I'll talk to the warden.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.130
"另一次机会"和"安全避难所"
"Another chance" and "safe haven."

00:22.130 --> 00:24.160
这都是出自一本有名的书
Those are the names of

00:24.160 --> 00:26.030
这些词都出自那"酗酒无名氏"的章节名
some of the chapters in the book they use an aa.

别乱来
Make no mistake about it.

00:27.830 --> 00:31.800

00:48.660 --> 00:49.900
基斯说你得赶紧跑
Kacee said you need to run.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.100
如果你被抓了或自首了
If you get busted or turn yourself in,

00:51.100 --> 00:53.030
迪迪就没爹没娘了
Dede won't have either of you.

迈克尔 我想让这一切结束
Michael, I want for this to be over.

00:54.830 --> 00:56.770
我们都想让这结束
That makes two of us.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.860
但我们得看你父亲到底给你留了什么
It's just a question of looking at whatever it is your father gave you.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.860
就只有一个钥匙
It's just a key.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.900
必要的话 可以利用下总统...
If I may, sir, the president... she could be useful.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.260

01:04.260 --> 01:05.660

01:05.660 --> 01:07.530
我们能搞定的
We can fix this,

01:07.530 --> 01:09.830
我不要你带这那两兄弟到处乱来
but not with those brothers running around the country.

01:09.830 --> 01:11.060
凯若琳...
Caroline...

01:11.060 --> 01:12.960
把他们交给我 保罗
bring them in, Paul,

01:12.960 --> 01:15.630
之后一切就可恢复原样了

Lincoln.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.960
莎拉
Sara.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.530
真是有趣 当你需要我了才打电话给我
It's funny how you only call me when you need me.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.900
也许有趣这个词用的并不恰当
Maybe "funny" is not the right word.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.100
这些都可解决的 保罗
All of this can go away, Paul.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.860

02:34.960 --> 02:36.200
你认为我们手上握有筹码?
You actually think we have a shot?

02:36.200 --> 02:39.830
那得看你爸留给了你什么
It depends on what your father gave you.

02:39.830 --> 02:41.900
这是我找到他时从他口袋掉出来的
This fell out of his pocket when I found him.

02:41.900 --> 02:45.930
我认不出这个标志 你呢?
I don't recognize the insignia, do you?

02:45.930 --> 02:48.560
不认识
No.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.660

-不...    -嘘 我去
-No...    -tu-tut-tut. I insist.

03:28.900 --> 03:32.730
不
No.

03:47.900 --> 03:51.560
我去把孩子们叫来
I'll get the kids.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.360
涂些润肤霜会让瘀伤好一点
Some hand cream will make them rope burns feel better.

孩子们得上学
The kids have school.

04:08.460 --> 04:11.300
在这段小小的适应期过后
We're all going to get back to our normal routines

04:11.300 --> 04:14.300
一切都会回复正常的
once this little adjustment period is over.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.730
今天有人会过来
There's someone coming over today.

04:15.730 --> 04:16.560

04:20.230 --> 04:22.130

如果她来了 我又不去开门
And,if she shows up,and I don't answer the door,

04:24.400 --> 04:27.760
她会发觉有点不对劲的
she's going to know something's wrong.

我不想你惹麻烦上身
I don't want you to get in trouble.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.060

04:59.060 --> 05:03.160
没什么麻烦
It's no trouble.

05:05.860 --> 05:09.330

05:18.430 --> 05:19.830

05:19.830 --> 05:22.830
我们目标一致啊
We all want the same thing.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.760
你没告诉我们你想让她死
You didn't tell us you left her to die.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.360
我只是吓吓她
I was scaring her.And I could pull her out.

05:31.530 --> 05:34.360
不 不 你想淹死我
No. No, you left me in there to drown.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.630
我倒想看看你能屏住呼吸多久
I wonder how long you can hold your breath.

05:35.630 --> 05:37.430
我们来试试看
Maybe we should find out.

05:37.430 --> 05:40.530

05:47.900 --> 05:49.000
我们会找出究竟是什么东西
We'll find out what it's for.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.430
我现在就可以告诉你们是什么东西
I can tell you what that key's for right now.

05:54.430 --> 05:56.630
这是一个私人雪茄俱乐部的钥匙
It's to a private cigar club.

80 30 77公路上的所有加油站

我要斯科菲尔德和布伦斯的照片贴满每一个加油站
I want Scofield's and Burrows' pictures on each and every gas pump.

07:00.930 --> 07:03.830
-没油他们哪都去不             -长官?
-If they have no fuel,they can't get anywhere.  -Sir?

07:03.830 --> 07:05.600
-什么事?  -我们或许得把我们的注意力
-What?    -We might need to divert our attention away

07:05.600 --> 07:08.300
从斯科菲尔德和布伦斯身上转移开一会儿了
from Scofield and Burrows for a while.

07:08.300 --> 07:09.560
为什么我得那样做
Why would I do that?

07:09.560 --> 07:12.560
因为另外一个逃犯刚刚杀了一个公民
Because one of the other escapees just killed a civilian.

07:12.630 --> 07:15.630
一个符合这样描述的人
A man fitting his description was spotted

07:15.630 --> 07:18.700
满身血迹地从残忍的杀人现场逃脱
running from the scene of a brutal homicide.

Happened in Algoma, Wisconsin,

07:20.700 --> 07:23.100

Call the field office in Madison,

07:24.860 --> 07:26.430
让他们立刻找一些特工去那儿
and have them get some agents out there right away.

07:26.430 --> 07:27.560
我马上报告总局
Okay.I'll notify headquarters.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.130
我没有说总局
I didn't say headquarters.

07:29.130 --> 07:31.100
我说 难道你不服从指挥
I said, are you not following direct orders?

07:31.100 --> 07:34.660
我服从 长官
Oh, I am following direct orders, sir.

07:34.660 --> 07:37.760
只不过现在不再服从你了
Just not from you anymore.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.860
从现在开始所有事件都要听从总部
Everything goes through headquarters from now on.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.030

08:02.430 --> 08:03.730
他是个精神病
Come on, the man is mentally ill.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.230
他什么都不知道 他并不是个威胁
He doesn't know anything, he's not a threat...

08:05.230 --> 08:08.030
帕托塞克当过一阵子斯科菲尔德的同房囚犯
Patoshik was one of Scofield's cellmates for awhile.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.630
斯科菲尔德把他列在逃跑计划中
Scofield included him in the escape.

08:09.630 --> 08:10.700
谁知道他知道些什么
Who knows what he knows?

08:10.700 --> 08:12.030
可斯科菲尔德和布伦斯还在逃
Scofield and Burrows are still out there.

08:12.030 --> 08:14.660
现在不用担心斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
Don't worry about Scofield and Burrows right now.

08:15.260 --> 08:18.560
好 再一次
So, again...

08:18.560 --> 08:20.800
帕托塞克
Patoshik goes.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.800
小心点
Take care of it.

我需要你给我一节空的车厢
I need you to clear a car for me.

08:35.660 --> 08:37.500
- 一个逃犯?      - 哦 是的
- A fugitive?    - Yes,that's right.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.560
只是
Well,

08:38.560 --> 08:40.230
我们的车厢快坐满了
it's just that we're already near capacity...

08:40.230 --> 08:42.600
你希望他碰到你的其他乘客?
you want him to rub elbows with your other passengers?

08:42.600 --> 08:43.960
-不 长官    -好吧
-No, sir.   -Okay.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.460
他以什么罪名被通缉
What's he wanted for?

08:45.460 --> 08:47.160
杀人
Killing people.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.360
天哪
Good lord. Make it happen.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.500
那确实发生了
Make it happen.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.630
好吧 来吧 跟着我
All right, come on, follow me.

09:03.660 --> 09:06.660
一切都会没事的
It's gonna be all right.

09:06.660 --> 09:10.460
如果你这么认为的话
If you say so.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.430
利用他帮我们得到我们需要的
We use him to get what we need,

09:13.430 --> 09:16.930
然后就甩掉他
then we dump him.

09:16.930 --> 09:19.900
好的
Okay.

09:24.100 --> 09:27.900

09:33.300 --> 09:36.700
谢谢
Thank you.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.560
其他的乘客不会遇到危险吧?
The other riders aren't in any danger, are they?

09:43.560 --> 09:45.660
我的意思是 我们是不是应该发布个公告什么的
I mean, should I make an announcement or anything?

09:45.660 --> 09:47.860
你希望这里变得一片混乱?
You want pandemonium?

09:47.860 --> 09:51.030
-不 长官   -好 不发布公告
-No,sir.  -Okay,then no announcements,right?

09:51.160 --> 09:52.600
只要让所有人远离这节车厢就行了
Just keep everybody out of this car

09:52.600 --> 09:53.660
那就万事大吉了
then everything is jake.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.900
我做这事儿都几百万次了
I've done this a million times.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.030

Never had a problem.

09:56.030 --> 09:59.330

10:09.460 --> 10:12.600

11:02.930 --> 11:05.060
你看上去不是很好
You don't look too good.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.230
我帮你搞定了莎拉·唐克雷蒂的事
I helped you with Sara Tancredi,

11:06.230 --> 11:08.000
你应该把我弄到隔离监狱去
and you were supposed to get me into AD Seg.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.500
我试过了
I tried.

11:11.500 --> 11:15.630
但是你的新监狱长...
But your new warden... Mm...

11:15.630 --> 11:17.030
是一个道德上循规蹈矩的人
straight as an arrow.

11:17.030 --> 11:21.760

然后把"停止营业"的牌子挂上
and turn the closed sign back,

23:27.410 --> 23:30.650
那别人就会觉得这里已经关门了 是吧?
so everybody thinks that this place is closed, all right?

23:30.650 --> 23:33.050
然后让大家都离窗户远点儿
And then, we can get everybody away from the window

23:33.050 --> 23:34.350

24:38.280 --> 24:39.950
我在保释中逃走

24:39.950 --> 24:42.380
并被通缉
I'm on the run,

24:42.380 --> 24:46.650

24:47.180 --> 24:50.450
我真没用

然后第二件就是...

25:47.510 --> 25:51.510
真讽刺 也许我不应该说是谁害死了他
ironically, I probably wouldn't even say

25:51.510 --> 25:55.450
如果我没有失去他的话 而且...
if I hadn't lost him, but, um...

25:55.450 --> 25:58.380
你知道...
you should know that...

26:03.750 --> 26:06.150
