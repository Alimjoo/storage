我要走了

00:26.970 --> 00:28.030
转过去
Turn around!

00:28.100 --> 00:29.900
轻点  甜心

他们拿到了

00:34.830 --> 00:36.900
我没想到 你能查到这么深
I never thought you'd make it this far.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.030
我错了
I was wrong.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.230
怎样
What now?

00:39.300 --> 00:41.070
这是你们的迁移文件
This is all your transfer paperwork.

00:41.130 --> 00:43.100
我得尽快赶到达洛斯那边去
I need to get to Dallow, ASAP.

00:45.230 --> 00:46.270

Self.

01:12.570 --> 01:13.600
他骗了我们
He screwed us.

01:13.670 --> 01:15.100
赛尔夫不能这么做
Self can't do that.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.600
他是政府人员  想干什么都行
He's government. He can do what he pleases.

01:26.100 --> 01:26.970
车一定会来的
The vans are coming.

01:27.030 --> 01:28.270

01:29.530 --> 01:31.130
你也不确定  林肯  他们会来的
You don't know that, Linc! They're coming!

01:31.200 --> 01:32.930
我们现在怎么办
What do we do now?

01:34.500 --> 01:38.430
给国安局打电话  看他们对赛尔夫了解多少
Call Homeland. See how much they know about Self.

01:41.030 --> 01:42.500

01:53.330 --> 01:54.430
你在什么地方
What's your position?

01:54.500 --> 01:58.030

You were right about this whole operation.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.170

No. Burrows, Burrows!

02:01.170 --> 02:03.170
唐
Don.

02:05.330 --> 02:06.500

I need to find Gretchen. You gonna help me?

02:13.600 --> 02:15.800

02:15.870 --> 02:18.500
帮[又意:救命]
Help.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.170
国土安全局
Department of Homeland Security.

02:22.230 --> 02:25.030
我找唐·赛尔夫的上司  谢谢
I'd like to talk to Don Self's superior, please.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.130
请稍等
One moment, please.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.630
我们把价值一亿的东西 就这么拱手送给这家伙了
We gave this guy something worth $100 million.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.730
他是国安局的吗  我们看过他的徽章吗
Is he even with Homeland? Did we see a badge?

02:33.800 --> 02:35.830
他给了我们枪  用C-130运输机送我们过来
We were given guns and flown out on a C-130.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.400
-他肯定不是车管局的 -这也不代表他是合法的
He didn't work for the DMV. That doesn't make him the law.

02:38.470 --> 02:39.670
不  不能
No, it don't.

02:39.730 --> 02:42.400
要是国安局从一开始就参与了呢
What if Homeland was in on this from the beginning?

02:42.470 --> 02:44.330
我是贺勃·斯坦顿  你是谁
This is Herb Stanton. Who is this?

02:47.330 --> 02:49.330
喂
Hello?

02:50.300 --> 02:53.170
我搞不清赛尔夫是怎么设的局
The way Self played this, I don't know.

02:53.230 --> 02:54.570
他一直让自己置身事外
He kept himself too insulated.

02:54.630 --> 02:56.700
这就是为什么 需要政府授权时
That's why, that's why he hesitated with official authorizations

02:56.770 --> 02:59.530
他总是犹豫 他总是说  这是为了防止
on behalf of our mission. He kept saying it was because he didn't want

02:59.600 --> 03:01.000
"公司"发现  而实际上
the Company to find out. In actuality,

03:01.070 --> 03:02.700
他是不想让人发现他的诡计
it's because he didn't want to get caught,

03:02.770 --> 03:03.900
狗娘养的
the son of a bitch!

03:03.970 --> 03:07.170
他部署周密 让我们去承担责任
He kept the circle tight. Left the rest of us holding the bag.

03:07.230 --> 03:12.000
如果国安局知道我们在哪 他们迟早会来抓我们
If Homeland knows where we're at. Sooner or later they're coming for us.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.070
让他们来吧 我们又没做错什么  我们有协议的
Let them come. we didn't do anything wrong. We have deals.

03:15.130 --> 03:16.530
不  我们只有白纸  赛尔夫留给我们的
No, we have paper. That's what Self left us.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.570
我们只有这些
That's what we have.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.570
我们得离开这里
We gotta get out of here.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.530
我们不能走  迈克尔需要做手术
We can't leave. Michael needs surgery.

03:23.830 --> 03:24.830
我说的不是逃跑
I'm not talking about running.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.300
我说的是活命
I'm talking about surviving.

03:35.600 --> 03:40.330
我想要的是目睹"公司"土崩瓦解
What I want is to see the Company burned to the ground

03:40.430 --> 03:42.630
而你  锒铛入狱
and you in prison.

03:45.370 --> 03:49.070
这是我们干的  我们干的
We did this to you. We did this to you.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.770
他们正在楼下等你  长官
They're ready for you downstairs, sir.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.600
今天是我们所有努力的关键时刻
Today marks a critical juncture in our endeavor.

04:14.670 --> 04:17.500
有没有"锡拉"的蛛丝马迹
Do we have a bead on Scylla yet?

04:17.570 --> 04:22.300
我们的安全和未来  均命悬一线
Our security, our future stands at a great precipice.

04:22.370 --> 04:24.370
到底有还是没有  乔纳森
It's a yes-or-no question, Jonathan.

04:25.730 --> 04:28.300
我们不想听你自言自语
And we don't need a soliloquy.

04:29.730 --> 04:33.430
霍华德  你去我办公室等我
Howard, why don't you wait in my office?

04:33.500 --> 04:39.700
不  我来此 是确保这次行动不会再出差错
No. I'm in here making sure this operation isn't fumbled as well.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.270
马上出去
Out... now.

04:45.330 --> 04:46.800
你有什么计划  乔纳森
What's your plan, Jonathan?

04:48.330 --> 04:51.670
我们来不就是为了这个吗
That's what we're all here for, right?

04:51.730 --> 04:55.330
你不听我们的箴言 执意转移"锡拉"  如今弄巧成拙
You tried to move Scylla over our better judgment, and it backfired,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.170
就认了吧
so spill it.

05:21.230 --> 05:23.830
还有其他问题吗
Any further questions?

05:25.930 --> 05:28.000
很好
Very well.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.400
你们都知道自己的任务了
You have your assignments.

05:29.470 --> 05:33.530
竭尽所能  今天就把"锡拉"找回来
Access your assets and retrieve Scylla today.

05:48.330 --> 05:50.370
赛尔夫探员  过去几个月里
Yeah, well, a lot of people that believed in me

05:50.430 --> 05:54.900
很多相信我的人 现在都死了
in the last few months, Agent Self, not all of them are alive today.

05:54.970 --> 05:58.170
我不明白这句话
I can't shake that line.

05:58.230 --> 06:00.030
"走为上策"
"All that avails is flight."

06:26.700 --> 06:28.330
起来
Come on.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.300

Here, take that.

06:45.300 --> 06:50.000
莎拉是对的  我们得送你去医院
Sara's right. We need to get you to a hospital now.

06:50.070 --> 06:55.270
我们就差那么一点 就那么一点
We were so close to the finish line. So close.

06:55.330 --> 06:56.730
我知道  我明白
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

06:56.800 --> 07:04.470
我昨天给LJ打了电话 告诉他一切都接近尾声了
Listen, I, uh, I spoke to LJ yesterday. Told him this was almost over.

07:06.230 --> 07:08.930
我要对我儿子信守诺言
I'm keeping my word to my son, Michael.

07:10.870 --> 07:12.600
我早该发现这个阴谋
I should have seen this coming.

07:12.670 --> 07:19.130
不  这不是任何人的错 是赛尔夫耍了我们
No, no, it's no one's fault. Self played all of us.

07:19.200 --> 07:23.330
我们得离开这里 这是我们最后的选择
We gotta get out of here. This is our last option.

07:27.570 --> 07:29.370
好的
Yeah.

07:45.770 --> 07:48.700
-查看楼上  -安全
Take upstairs.Clear.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.700

Now we know where we stand.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.130

我是贺勃·斯坦顿  国土安全局的
Herb Stanton, Department of Homeland Security.

08:12.130 --> 08:13.970
我们想谈谈
We want to talk.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.800
你们能不能回仓库
Can you please come back to the warehouse?

08:15.870 --> 08:19.870
没问题  但首先得给我们一些保障
All right, but first we're gonna need some assurances.

08:19.930 --> 08:21.700
你指什么
What kind of assurances?

08:21.770 --> 08:23.670
我们遵守了我们的诺言
Look, we held up our end of the deal,

08:23.730 --> 08:26.530
所以  我们要你 履行协议里的条件
so we're gonna need you to honor the terms of our agreements.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.570
那我得重新看一下那些条件
Well, I'd have to take another look at those terms,

08:28.630 --> 08:30.830
但我确定里面不包括偷走"锡拉"
but I'm fairly certain it didn't include stealing Scylla

08:30.900 --> 08:34.900
和冷血杀害两名联邦探员
or killing two federal agents in cold blood.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.770
你这话是什么意思
What are you talking about?

08:36.830 --> 08:39.970
我给你们准备了 一些新的条件
Here are the new terms I'm prepared to offer.

08:40.030 --> 08:42.200
回来  自首
Come back, turn yourselves in...

08:42.270 --> 08:44.270
等等  是赛尔夫算计了我们
Wait a minute! Self set us up!

08:44.330 --> 08:48.500
否则 我会追捕你们到天涯海角
Don't, and I'll hunt you down like animals.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.230

09:48.300 --> 09:50.630

09:50.700 --> 09:53.400
只要揪出赛尔夫  证明他拿了"锡拉"
All we have to do is flush Self out, prove he has Scylla.

09:53.470 --> 09:54.900
我们怎么做呢

我表弟裴迪可以接应我们

Gretchen.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.800
他会卖掉它
He's got to sell it.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.600
我要是猜错了  就说一声
Tell me when I'm getting warm.

12:03.670 --> 12:06.270
你精心挑选了迈克尔·斯科菲尔德一伙人
You hand-picked Michael Scofield and the bunch,

12:06.330 --> 12:09.330
花政府的银子把他们运过来
trucked them all out here on Uncle Sam's dime,

12:09.400 --> 12:11.400
为你卖命  现在他们
to do your bidding, and now they're

12:11.470 --> 12:14.270
成了你的所作所为的枪靶子
standing right in the crosshairs for what you did.

12:15.830 --> 12:19.370
我真佩服你  唐  干得比蒙娜丽莎还漂亮
I gotta hand it to you Don, if that ain't the Mona Lisa.

12:21.570 --> 12:25.370
我一直说警察比罪犯还狡猾
I always said cops are more crooked than criminals.

12:25.430 --> 12:28.630
让我猜一猜  就为了 尝点甜头吗
Let me guess. a little, little slice of heaven, is that what it was for?

12:30.100 --> 12:31.270
还赌债
Gambling debt?

12:31.330 --> 12:37.400
或许你是个 研究冰糖种类的地质学家
Maybe you're a... a geologist of the rock candy variety?

12:37.470 --> 12:39.770
用格雷琴的指纹查到的信息
The information you got from Gretchen's prints,

12:39.830 --> 12:41.530
你确定是正确的地址吗
you sure it's the right address?

12:41.600 --> 12:46.300
-完全正确  -很好  现在 闭嘴  否则我毙了你 懂了吗
Right as rain. Good. Now, shut up or I'm gonna shoot you. Understand me?

12:46.370 --> 12:47.300
我
Oh, I, I...

12:47.370 --> 12:48.270
-闭嘴  -我没有
Shut your mouth. I ain't...

12:48.330 --> 12:49.630
-我知道什么时候  -闭嘴
-I know when... -Shut your mouth.

12:49.700 --> 12:50.930
-闭嘴  -安静
to shut my... Be quiet.

12:58.130 --> 13:01.630
在这个城市找个公共电话要多久时间
How long does it take to find a pay phone in this city?

13:01.700 --> 13:03.830
他们就快回来了
They'll be back.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.670
好了
Okay.

13:07.730 --> 13:08.930
跟以前一样
Same deal as before.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
是的
Yeah.

13:10.070 --> 13:12.870
在接下来8小时内 不能有身体压力
No physical duress for the next eight hours.

13:15.330 --> 13:18.830
重要的是 你需要帮助
Here's the thing. You need help.

13:18.900 --> 13:24.500
到处奔走 追查赛尔夫是不安全的
And running around trying to track down Self isn't... safe.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.130
只要几小时  我们就能到墨西哥
We could be in Mexico in a few hours.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.770
那里有我信任的医生
There are doctors there that I trust.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.570
一直以来  都是你照顾我们
And you've been taking care of all of us.

13:33.630 --> 13:36.800
现在由我们来照顾你也是理所当然
I think it's really okay if we take care of you.

13:39.370 --> 13:41.570
不管做不做手术
Surgery or no surgery...

13:41.630 --> 13:43.600
不把那些人搞垮
I'm never gonna be able to live with myself

13:43.670 --> 13:51.470
我是无法独自苟存的 就这么简单
unless I find a way to take these people down. It's that simple,

13:51.530 --> 13:53.670
我明白
and, uh... I get it.

13:53.730 --> 13:56.670
我不强求你感同身受
I'm not gonna demand that you feel the same way.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.230
告诉你  我们不能相信任何人
I'm telling you, we can't trust anyone.

14:05.300 --> 14:06.230
政府  执法机关
government, law enforcement...

14:06.300 --> 14:09.200
-所以我们才应该想办法离开这里  -不行
Which is all the more reason we should consider getting out of here. No.

14:09.270 --> 14:10.770
我们要了结这事
We deal with this now.

14:10.830 --> 14:11.660
我也想把他揪出来
I want this guy as much as you do,

14:11.660 --> 14:12.700
但我们都自身难保
but we're scrambling here.

14:12.770 --> 14:14.600
我不知道赛尔夫策划了多久
I mean, I don't know how long Self has been planning

14:14.670 --> 14:16.530
就表面看来  简直天衣无缝
this thing and from the looks of it, it's pretty air-tight.

14:47.370 --> 14:48.700
格雷琴
Gretchen.

14:48.770 --> 14:50.990
我希望你打电话是告诉我"锡拉"的下落  林肯
I hope you're calling me to tell me where Scylla is, Lincoln.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.400
你不知道吗
You don't know?

14:52.470 --> 14:53.670
我不知道
I don't know.

14:53.730 --> 14:55.370
怎么回事
What's going on?

14:55.430 --> 14:57.770
赛尔夫出卖了我们  他拿走了"锡拉"
Self double-crossed us and he took Scylla.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.600
你知道他可能在哪吗
You know where he could be?

15:02.330 --> 15:04.670
如果我是赛尔夫  我会找个新买家
If I'm Self, I'm looking for a new buyer.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.170
新买家
A new buyer?

15:06.230 --> 15:07.170
告诉你
You know what?

15:07.230 --> 15:10.270
你要是耍我 我就把你劈成两半
If you're playing me, I'm gonna split you in half.

15:11.330 --> 15:13.330
我和你们一样想找出他
I want him just as badly as you do.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.530
你们在哪  我去找你们
Where are you? I'm coming to you.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.400
希望公园  一小时后见
Grand Hope Park. One hour.

15:22.830 --> 15:23.900
什么事
What?

15:23.970 --> 15:25.300
姐姐
Sis.

15:25.370 --> 15:31.370
是 艾米丽  她 出事了
It's... Emily. She's, um... been in an accident.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.530
我要你告诉用枪指着你的人
I want you to tell whoever's got that gun pointed at you

15:34.600 --> 15:37.100
长个胆子再听电话
to grow a set and get on the phone.

15:38.970 --> 15:40.770
她要和你谈
She wants to talk to you.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.600
别来无恙  格雷琴
What's up, Gretchen?

15:47.270 --> 15:49.600
该回家了
Time to come home now.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.790
我们真的要相信那个婊子吗
Are we really gonna keep trusting that bitch?

15:58.850 --> 16:02.290
格雷琴和帝博格 当时拿着枪等在伽特啊  伙计们
Gretchen and T-Bag, Were waiting at GATE with machine guns, guys.

16:02.350 --> 16:04.690
你以为他们想提供后援吗
You think they just wanted to provide cover?

16:04.750 --> 16:06.150
这个女人唯利是图
This chick's a mercenary.

16:06.220 --> 16:08.220
她为达目的可以不择手段
She'll do whatever it takes to get what she wants,

16:08.290 --> 16:10.420
目前我们只是碰巧想要同一样东西
and right now we just happen to want the same thing.

16:10.490 --> 16:13.520
我们要有所防备
We are taking precautions, but...

16:13.590 --> 16:14.750
但不管怎样  格雷琴
one way or the other, Gretchen's

16:14.820 --> 16:19.420
能帮我们找到赛尔夫  而现在 这才是最重要的
gonna get us to Self, and right now... ...that is all that matters.

16:19.490 --> 16:20.520
我们根本没机会
We don't stand a chance.

16:20.590 --> 16:23.150
我们的照片还没有在电视上公开
Our photos aren't plastered all over the TV.

16:23.220 --> 16:25.520
国安局没有公开
Homeland's keeping it in-house.

16:25.590 --> 16:26.750
我们还有机会
We have a chance.

16:36.050 --> 16:38.050
参议员
Senator?

16:38.120 --> 16:39.420
贺勃
Herb.

16:41.920 --> 16:45.820
我们本着好意开展这次行动
We sponsored this operaton with the best of intentions,

16:45.820 --> 16:49.020
但我们采取的秘密方式
but the secretive manner in which we've handled it

16:49.090 --> 16:52.520
我担心会弄巧成拙
I now fear is working against us.

16:52.590 --> 16:53.550
怎么说
How so?

16:53.620 --> 16:54.950
我们正在搜捕罪犯
We're in the middle of a manhunt,

16:55.020 --> 16:59.220
但只有你 和几个特工出动
and it's just you and a couple of agents out there trying to rein in these cons.

16:59.290 --> 17:00.990
这太疯狂了
It's madness.

17:05.550 --> 17:10.020
我们最初开展的计划 没有成功
What we initally sponsored... didn't pan out.

17:10.090 --> 17:13.150
但不意味着一发不可收拾
That doesn't mean that the boat is taking on water.

17:13.220 --> 17:15.590
没有人知道
No one knows.

17:15.820 --> 17:19.190
以后也不会有人知道
That's the way it's going to stay.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.750
进来
Come in!

17:24.790 --> 17:25.820
下午好
Good afternoon.

理查德·苏特  美国联邦执法局

我奉副局长伊斯玛之命 彻查斯科菲尔德

17:32.780 --> 17:34.420
和布伦斯的案件
of the Scofield/Burrows Supermax story

17:34.490 --> 17:36.150
一次查清
once and for all.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.350
我希望你们能帮忙
I'm hoping you gentlemen can help.

17:39.720 --> 17:43.890
各位  如果有 难言之隐  但说无妨

你的承受力如何
How strong is your stomach?

17:48.690 --> 17:50.890
很强
Very.

17:50.950 --> 17:54.820
贺勃·斯坦顿
Herb... Stanton.

17:54.890 --> 17:58.720
他和唐·赛尔夫合作
He's working with Donald Self.

17:58.790 --> 18:04.450
我们拿到了今天所有国安局的电话记录
We got a record of all incoming and outgoing calls from Homeland today.

18:04.520 --> 18:08.690
斯坦顿接到一个大概有一分钟的电话
Stanton received a call lasting approximately one minute

18:08.750 --> 18:14.150
但来电人不明 我们无法确认此人身份
that was connected to no one. No one we could identify.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.620
赛尔夫打的电话
Self's phone.

18:15.690 --> 18:19.050
交管局从一个道路摄像头里 发现了格雷琴
D.O.T. has a positive ID on Gretchen from a traffic cam.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.450

现在  关于这位斯坦顿先生
Now, about this Mr. Stanton...

18:37.850 --> 18:40.020

That's far enough.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.850
够了
Ah... that's far enough.

19:27.890 --> 19:29.890

19:35.690 --> 19:37.190
完全不必担心
Don't worry about a thing.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.520
你让冯来抓我  差点让我丧命
You know, sending Feng after me almost cost me my life,

19:46.590 --> 19:49.350
也打破了我的计划  所以我才找你来
and it did cost me my plan, which is why you're here,

19:49.420 --> 19:53.290
格雷琴 你得帮我找个新买家 买"锡拉"
Gretchen. You're going to help me find a new buyer for Scylla.

19:56.490 --> 19:59.620
你跟斯科菲尔德他们通过电话呢
You've been talking to Scofield and the boys, huh?

20:00.990 --> 20:03.350
他们怎样
Yeah, how are they?

Good and pissed.

20:04.790 --> 20:05.890
他们在哪
Yeah, where are they?

20:05.950 --> 20:08.350
唐  我不知道  我又不是他们老妈
Gee, Don, I don't know, I'm not their mother.

20:08.420 --> 20:10.220
你不是他们老妈
You're not their mother,

20:10.290 --> 20:19.820

but... She looks just like you. Doesn't she?

20:19.890 --> 20:22.790
她有一双大大的蓝眼睛
She's... got those big blue eyes.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.750
我半小时后要和他们碰面
I'm supposed to meet them in a half an hour.

20:29.820 --> 20:33.150
给国安局打个小报告
Get ready to phone in a tip to homeland.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.620
在哪见面
Where at?

20:35.690 --> 20:37.620
在哪
Where?

20:55.390 --> 20:57.490
迈克尔  开展这次行动
To perform the operation,  Michael,

20:57.550 --> 21:01.120
大概需要 20个部门的头头签名
that would require signatures from about 20 different department heads.

21:01.190 --> 21:04.620
唯一可行的方法 是暗中进行
The only way this is going to work is via freelancer, off the books.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.290
我应该感谢你们
I should be thanking you.

21:08.350 --> 21:12.020
由于你们的功劳 生活将从此改变
Okay, because of what you've done, lives are going to be changed forever.

21:21.290 --> 21:23.290
斯科菲尔德  重新考虑了我的条件吗
Scofield, have you reconsidered my offer?

21:23.350 --> 21:25.650
如果我把赛尔夫和"锡拉"都交给你
If I get you Self and if I can get you Scylla,

21:25.720 --> 21:27.990
你会不会遵守之前的诺言
are you going to be able to hold up our deals?

21:29.520 --> 21:30.950
你怎么会有这种想法
How do you intend on doing that?

21:33.020 --> 21:35.450
我们一直努力这么做
Well, that's what we're working on.

21:43.250 --> 21:44.350
联调局的人来了
The feds, they're here.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.350
这是陷阱
We were set up.

22:17.090 --> 22:19.190
把手举起来
Hands where I can see them!

22:34.820 --> 22:36.920
杀害两名联邦探员
Killing two federal agents ought to put you back

22:36.980 --> 22:39.120
足够判你死刑  布伦斯先生
on top of Death Row, Mr. Burrows.

22:42.720 --> 22:46.050
我们没杀任何人 是赛尔夫在操纵
We didn't kill anyone. Self's behind this.

22:46.120 --> 22:50.280
唐·赛尔夫 是一位称职的探员和高尚的公民
Don Self, is a decorated agent and an honorable man.

22:50.350 --> 22:51.580
对
Yeah.

22:51.650 --> 22:54.450
你不是第一个坐在椅子上
You wouldn't be the first guy to sit in that chair

22:54.520 --> 22:56.520
试图蒙蔽我的人
and try to sell me a bill of goods.

22:56.580 --> 22:58.450
你们把事情弄清时
Why weren't we halfway to Mexico

22:58.520 --> 22:59.750
我们怎么没在去墨西哥的路上
by the time you worked things out?

22:59.820 --> 23:01.320
-你们疏忽了  -不是
-You slipped up.  -No.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.620
因为我们跟你一样被蒙在鼓里
Because we were in the dark just as much as you were.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.680
布伦斯  我们清楚发生了什么事
We know what happened, Burrows.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.180
你没有把事情联系起来
You're not putting this together.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.950
想想"锡拉"值多少钱
Think about how much Scylla's worth.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.380
想想赛尔夫隐蔽 这一切的尺度
Think of the lengths that Self went to to keep this thing...

23:10.450 --> 23:12.680
一切暗中进行
to keep this thing off the books.

23:12.750 --> 23:17.180
我们呢  我们所有人 努力完成任务
And us? Us, of all people, pulling this job off.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.750
尸体在哪
Where are the bodies?

23:18.820 --> 23:20.580
只要五分钟  不要想我们
For five minutes, stop thinking about us,

23:20.650 --> 23:22.820
想想赛尔夫
and focus on Self!

23:22.880 --> 23:25.080
我们为什么不珍视自由
Why would we jeopardize our freedom?

23:25.150 --> 23:28.780
那是我们一直以来唯一在乎的东西
It's the only thing we've ever cared about!

23:37.750 --> 23:38.980
费尔南多在哪
Where's Fernando?

23:39.050 --> 23:40.150
他在路上
He's on his way.

23:40.220 --> 23:41.350
迈克尔  我局里还有个朋友
Michael, look, I still have a friend in the Bureau

23:41.420 --> 23:42.720
我们可以找她
we can reach out to.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.650
也许她能找出 林肯关在什么地方
Maybe she can make some calls, see where they're holding Linc.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.180
你打给谁
Who are you calling?

23:49.050 --> 23:50.980
是斯科菲尔德
It's Scofield.

23:51.050 --> 23:52.850
那就接吧
All right. So answer it.

23:56.550 --> 23:59.020
之前有机会 我就应该打爆你的头
I should have put a bullet in your face  when I had the chance.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.280
迈克尔  不是我陷害你
I'm not the one who set you up, Michael.

24:01.350 --> 24:02.880
那是谁
Yeah? Who did?

24:07.650 --> 24:10.350
迈克尔  我之前说的都是真的
You know, I meant what I said before, Michael.

24:10.420 --> 24:11.980
我喜欢你做事的方式
I like your style. Okay?

24:12.050 --> 24:13.420
你聪明过人
You're a smart guy.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.250
只可惜  我比你更聪明一点
Unfortunately for you, I'm just a little bit smarter.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.920
是吗  我们等着瞧
Yeah? We'll see about that.

24:17.980 --> 24:21.150
听说国安局的人去了广场吧
I heard Homeland made a surprise visit to the plaza, huh?

24:21.220 --> 24:24.480
我给你点临行建议 逃跑
Look, I'm going to give you some parting advice. Run.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.320
带上你的同伴开始逃跑吧
Okay, get your pals and just start running.

24:27.380 --> 24:29.650
我们得走了  迈克尔  得走了
We gotta go. Michael, we gotta go.

24:29.720 --> 24:30.820
感谢你的帮助
I appreciate all your help, all right?

24:30.880 --> 24:32.250
我现在要把"锡拉"卖了
I'm going to sell Scylla now.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.550
唐  你哪也去不了
Don, you're not going anywhere.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.380
是吗
Really? Okay.

24:37.450 --> 24:38.580
谁是买家
Who's the buyer?

24:38.650 --> 24:40.450
他叫怀肯
His name is Vikan.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.620
他不是买家  他只是个中间人
And he's not a buyer. He's a conduit.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.050
谁的中间人
A conduit to what?

24:43.120 --> 24:44.780
我们可不是转移海洛因到这里
We're not exactly moving heroin here.

24:44.850 --> 24:46.720
这个更特殊
It's a little bit more specialized.

24:46.780 --> 24:48.180
世上大概有五个人
There's about five people in the world

24:48.250 --> 24:50.780
知道"锡拉"的用途且愿意购买
who know what do with Scylla and are willing to pay for it.

24:50.850 --> 24:52.580
行  我们走
All right. Let's go.

24:52.650 --> 24:55.080
巴格维尔待在这里
Bagwell's staying here.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.080
如果你动她们任何一个
You're going to find yourself captive in my negativity

24:59.150 --> 25:01.020
我就不放过你
if you lay a hand on either one of them.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.280
我警告过你不要惹我
I warned you not to screw me over.

25:08.780 --> 25:10.480
你怎能这样
How could you?

25:10.550 --> 25:13.620
我很快就回来
I'll be back very, very soon.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.250
我保证  他不会伤害你
And I promise you, that man is not going to hurt you.

25:21.380 --> 25:24.320
你怎能这样
How could you?

25:24.380 --> 25:27.620
我会解决的
I'm going to fix this.

25:28.980 --> 25:30.650
格雷琴  你真是
Wow, Gretchen, you're making friends

25:30.720 --> 25:33.150
左右逢源啊
left and right, huh?

25:33.220 --> 25:34.950
走吧
Now move your ass.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.080
我们查了赛尔夫的出国鉴定
We've accessed Self's E.I.D.

25:44.150 --> 25:47.020
找到了他试图删除的文件
We've been able to get to files he tried to delete.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.120
我们更清楚地认识到
They're giving us a lot clearer picture

25:49.180 --> 25:51.180
他的为人  他的企图
of who he is and what he's been up to.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.380
很高尚  对吧
Honorable, huh?

25:55.120 --> 25:57.320
你发现了什么
What did you find out?

25:57.380 --> 25:59.980
一个名字  罗伯特·沃克
A name. Robert Walker.

26:00.050 --> 26:02.680
赛尔夫打算用的新身份
The new identity Self is planning on using.

26:02.750 --> 26:04.550
我们发现一个社保号
We found a Social Security number,

26:04.620 --> 26:06.080
开曼的银行账号和信用卡
a bank account in the Caymans, credit cards

26:06.150 --> 26:08.220
还有一个明早去那里的
and a flight itinerary

26:08.280 --> 26:10.580
航班旅行指南
out of the country for tomorrow morning.

26:10.650 --> 26:12.480
所以
So,

26:12.550 --> 26:16.680
首先  我们向你道歉
first of all, we owe you an apology.

26:16.750 --> 26:19.920
其次  我们抓住他时
And, second, when we finally get our hands on him,

26:19.980 --> 26:21.880
重要的是你的帮助
it's going to be paramount to get your help.

26:21.950 --> 26:24.220
怎么帮
How?

26:24.280 --> 26:25.380
你的证词
Your testimony,

26:25.450 --> 26:27.020
还有你弟弟
and the testimony of your brother

26:27.080 --> 26:28.680
及其他人的证词
and the others against Self

26:28.750 --> 26:32.520
来交换全部豁免权  你们就可以离开
in exchange for full immunity. You walk away.

26:32.580 --> 26:34.480
我们已经说好的
We already had a deal.

26:34.550 --> 26:36.850
如果你现在离开  就没有人讲清整个事件
If you walk now, there'll be no one left to tell the tale.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.520
国安局会需要你们来掩盖事实
DHS needs you to cover its ass.

26:39.580 --> 26:42.480
我们不能浪费时间去追捕你朋友
We can't spend our time chasing your friends.

26:42.550 --> 26:43.780
他们得过来
They need to come in

26:43.850 --> 26:45.880
我们才能商讨细节
so we can work out the details.

26:45.950 --> 26:48.280
如果他们不来呢
What if they don't?

26:48.350 --> 26:50.480
我们不敢再相信任何人了
We got a whole bunch of trust issues.

26:50.550 --> 26:53.550
那你们只能在监狱里抑郁而终
Then, you'll all rot in a Supermax prison.

26:53.620 --> 26:57.080
国安局会准备揭开事情真相
DHS is prepared to fly into the face of this thing

26:57.150 --> 26:58.720
或隐瞒一切
or to bury it.

26:58.780 --> 27:01.480
你来选择  布伦斯先生
It's your choice, Mr. Burrows.

27:03.680 --> 27:07.420
这是你们最好的出路
This is the best you're gonna do.

27:14.050 --> 27:15.420
迈克尔

27:15.480 --> 27:17.150
林肯  你在哪
Linc, where are you?

27:17.220 --> 27:18.580
在仓库里
In the warehouse.

27:18.650 --> 27:19.920
开扩音器
Put me on speaker.

27:21.020 --> 27:23.920
国安局知道赛尔夫陷害了我们
Homeland knows self screwed us.

27:23.980 --> 27:25.720
有什么消息
What do we have?

27:25.780 --> 27:27.620
他们找到了他没有销毁掉的文件
They found a file he thought he deleted

27:27.680 --> 27:28.920

27:31.080 --> 27:32.320
结束了
So it's over.

27:32.380 --> 27:34.420
对
Yeah, well...

27:34.480 --> 27:38.520
如果我们指证赛尔夫  就能豁免
If we testify against self, we get full immunity.

27:38.580 --> 27:39.620
豁免什么罪
Immunity from what?

27:39.680 --> 27:41.280
我们已经完成了
We... we did the job

27:41.350 --> 27:42.820
他们交的任务
They hired us to do.

27:44.420 --> 27:46.420
迈克尔  我是康拉德·达洛斯议员
Michael, senator conrad dallow.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.580
我们有证据证明你们所说的
We have evidence that supports your claims.

27:48.580 --> 27:51.480
我向你保证  你们没事了
I'm giving you my word your troubles are over now.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.430
请回来  我们才能结束这一切
Please come in so we can end this

28:05.980 --> 28:09.150
好  我决定
Okay, um, I've decided...

28:09.220 --> 28:13.720
或者说  我认为我们应该听议员的
Rather, I think that, uh, we should hear the senator out.

28:13.780 --> 28:15.020
而且
And, uh,

28:15.080 --> 28:16.820
如果进展不顺
If everything goes south, then I do

28:16.880 --> 28:17.980
我也有后备计划
Have a backup plan.

28:18.050 --> 28:19.750
苏克雷  我希望你和莎拉一起
Sucre, I want you to go with sara

28:19.820 --> 28:21.550
去碰面地点密切注视着
To the meeting place and get a lookout.

28:21.620 --> 28:23.650
阿历克斯和我会确定
Alex and I are gonna make sure they don't bring

28:23.720 --> 28:24.850
他们没有耍诈
Any surprises by doubling back

28:24.920 --> 28:26.050
回到仓库
To the warehouse

28:26.120 --> 28:28.650
然后跟他们去约定地点
And then following them to the rendezvous.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.580
这是和议员见面的地点
This is where we're meeting the senator.

28:30.650 --> 28:31.880
好吗
All right?

28:31.950 --> 28:33.080
没问题
We'll be there.

28:43.150 --> 28:46.520
我父亲大部分的政治生涯
You know, my father spent most of his political life...

28:46.580 --> 28:48.820
都在伸张正义
Chasing justice.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.920
就像某种强迫症
It was sort of an obsession.

28:52.980 --> 28:55.880
母亲和我无法理解
And my mother and I could never understand

28:55.950 --> 28:58.850
他为何如此轻易地
Why he would so easily

28:58.920 --> 29:03.220
把别人的事情揽上身
Make other people's problems his own.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.750
我想这也是她离开他的原因
And I think it's why she left him.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.430
迈克尔  这些天
And, michael, you remind me

29:09.430 --> 29:12.380
你不断让我想起他
more and more of him these days.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.480
你总是把别人的事看得
The way you put everybody else's problems

29:15.550 --> 29:17.820
比自己的还重要
Before your own.

29:20.850 --> 29:23.080
就是说
That said...

29:24.480 --> 29:25.850
我想让你知道
...i want you to know that,

29:25.850 --> 29:29.340
如果和达洛斯议员的会面
if this meeting with senator dallow

29:29.340 --> 29:31.350
没能如你所愿
doesn't go the way you want it to,

29:31.420 --> 29:34.720
你不用担心我们的事
You don't have to worry about you and I.

29:34.780 --> 29:37.620
没有什么
Nothing's...

29:39.450 --> 29:41.750
没有什么能拆散我们
...nothing's gonna come between us.

29:41.820 --> 29:43.950
对
Yeah.

29:46.450 --> 29:50.680
一切都会好的  对吗
And everything is gonna be okay, right?

30:03.420 --> 30:06.150
我想明白了
You know, I've figured it out.

30:06.220 --> 30:08.950
国安局一开始对你糖衣炮弹
Dhs wined and dined you in the beginning

30:09.020 --> 30:10.280
许你整个世界
And promised you the world,

30:10.350 --> 30:11.580
完成之后 把你和一个傻子
And then they ultimately settled

30:11.650 --> 30:15.580
扔到扫帚柜
On a broom closet

30:15.650 --> 30:16.850
你就反口了
And you said nil.

30:18.480 --> 30:21.180
格雷琴  你观察很敏锐
Gretchen, you have a real keen sense of perception.

30:21.250 --> 30:22.320
很惊人
It's amazing.

30:22.380 --> 30:24.250
而一切结束后
And this all ends

30:24.320 --> 30:27.580
住塔希提岛的三层小屋  对吗
With a three-story hut in tahiti, right?

30:27.650 --> 30:30.980
纯平电视  室外有摩托艇
Flat-screen tv, a couple jet skis outside.

30:31.050 --> 30:33.280
唐  但你会发现
But what you're gonna find, don,

30:33.350 --> 30:35.080
当这一切结束了
Is that when the rush is over

30:35.150 --> 30:37.620
你不会受到任何赞誉
And you're done patting yourself on the back

30:37.680 --> 30:39.420
也没有人给你倾诉
And there's no one left to tell the story to,

30:39.480 --> 30:41.720
你会一如既往地孤独
You'll be just as alone as you are now.

30:41.780 --> 30:44.780
这才是唐·赛尔夫的面目
That's who don self is.

30:44.850 --> 30:46.220
是吗
Is that right?

30:46.280 --> 30:48.150
你说呢

Take out your gun.

31:05.180 --> 31:06.650

31:08.150 --> 31:09.080
拿出枪
Take out your gun.

31:09.150 --> 31:10.150
唐  放松点
Relax, don.

瞄准她的头
Point it at her head.

31:16.050 --> 31:17.450
唐

否则  你和你的家人会发现
Otherwise, you and your family are gonna find out

31:31.880 --> 31:32.980
唐·赛尔夫的真面目
Who the real don self is,

31:33.050 --> 31:34.180
-明白吗  -是他
You understand me? that's him.

31:34.250 --> 31:35.480

Do you understand me? we're set.

31:38.220 --> 31:40.520
行了吧  是他
Okay, that's him.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.220
不对啊
This can't be right.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.850
你确定他是这样写的吗
You sure this is what he wrote down?

32:16.920 --> 32:17.920
是这样写的
That's what it says.

32:17.980 --> 32:19.920
是个停车场
It's a parking lot.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.650

我以为你和迈克尔
I thought you and michael

32:24.180 --> 32:25.320

他很安全  迈克尔很安全
He's safe. michael's safe.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.350
我们无法单独完成任务
We're not gonna be able to do this alone.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.050
他在完成自己的任务
He's doing what he has to do,

32:35.120 --> 32:37.220
我们也要完成自己的任务
And we have to do our part.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.420

32:52.950 --> 32:54.550
迈克尔在哪

33:47.080 --> 33:49.050

33:49.120 --> 33:51.420
你听到马宏说的了
You heard mahone.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.920
这是迈克尔的主意
This is what michael wants.

33:52.980 --> 33:56.020
没错
Yeah, right.

33:56.080 --> 33:59.920
但如果和达洛斯的交易是合法的
Okay, but if the deal with Dallow is legit,

33:59.980 --> 34:03.320

确保我们不会有麻烦
making sure that we don't run into trouble again.

34:07.650 --> 34:09.760
对  但如果他遇到麻烦
Yes, but if he's in trouble,

34:09.760 --> 34:11.750
会需要我们的帮助
he's going to need our help.

34:11.820 --> 34:16.350
也许他觉得我们也不能做些什么了
Well, maybe he thinks there's nothing left for us to do.

34:26.780 --> 34:30.320
我们现在走  就等于丢下他
If we leave now, we're leaving him behind.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.550
我没想到唐·赛尔夫隐瞒了一切
I didn't know Don Self had it in him.

34:47.620 --> 34:50.020
我们现在知道他是幕后黑手
Now that we know he's behind this,

34:50.080 --> 34:52.320
形式更严峻
our situation's a lot worse.

34:52.380 --> 34:57.880
我们别再说什么事业了
We're not talking about our careers anymore.

34:57.950 --> 35:00.980
现在真的是牢狱之灾了
We're talking about real jail time.

35:01.050 --> 35:02.880
我们未经国会批准
We get 15 years just for conducting

35:02.950 --> 35:06.980
擅自组织行动  会判15年
an unauthorized operation without Congressional approval.

35:07.050 --> 35:10.180
或者完全免除
Or not.

35:11.620 --> 35:14.880
没必要再谈什么封锁遏制了
This doesn't have to be about containment anymore.

35:14.950 --> 35:18.620
可以斩草除根
It could be about excision.

35:23.180 --> 35:25.580
你意下如何  议员
You all right with that, Senator?

35:32.750 --> 35:34.150
那让他们去吧
Then they all go.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.250
其他人呢
Where are the others?

35:39.320 --> 35:40.950
马宏  苏克雷  唐克雷蒂
Mahone, Sucre, Tancredi.

35:41.020 --> 35:42.350
他们不会来
They're not coming.

35:42.420 --> 35:46.550
林肯和我会作证  但其他人
Linc and I will testify, but the others...

35:46.620 --> 35:48.250
我们全部豁免
Well, we all get immunity.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.380
就这些条件
Those are the terms.

35:49.450 --> 35:52.080
我们的证词就能把赛尔夫定罪
Our testimony alone will put Self away.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.980
先生  我们要结束这一切
Gentleman, we can't have the others running around

35:55.050 --> 35:57.880
就不能让他们在外逃窜
while we're trying to wrap this up.

35:57.950 --> 36:00.880
能打他们打电话吗  叫他们过来
Can we call 'em? Can we get 'em here?

36:00.950 --> 36:03.720
交易对象是你们所有人  这才是条件
The deal was for all of you.  Those were the terms.

36:03.780 --> 36:05.950
不是全部人  就免谈
Without everybody, this is no deal.

36:06.020 --> 36:08.450
听着  你们会如愿的  好吧
Listen, pal, you're gonna get what you want, all right?

36:08.520 --> 36:11.120
你打不打电话给他们
Are you gonna call them or not?

36:11.180 --> 36:16.250
根本没有交易  对吧  议员
Hmm, there never was a deal, was there, Senator?

36:20.320 --> 36:23.720
我希望能给你更好的答案  迈克尔
I wish I could give you a better answer, Michael,

36:23.780 --> 36:28.520
但唐·赛尔夫留下很多烫手山芋
but Don Self left a lot of rough edges.

36:28.580 --> 36:30.620
我们得全部摆平
We have to smooth them out.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.950
告诉我  他们在哪
You want to tell me where they are?

36:34.020 --> 36:35.320
我们不会说的
It ain't gonna happen.

36:39.180 --> 36:40.950
我能帮你抓到赛尔夫
I can get you Self.

36:41.020 --> 36:42.480
我也能帮你拿到"锡拉"
I can still get you Scylla.

36:42.550 --> 36:46.020
"锡拉"  我们不谈"锡拉"
Scylla? Oh, we're past Scylla.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.580
在弄回"锡拉"和现在了结之间选择
Between getting it back and ending this now,

36:49.580 --> 36:50.150
已经很简单了
the choice is simple.

36:50.220 --> 36:54.920
现在就给你案件的答案  理查德
You wanted your Supermax answer, you got it, Richard.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.780
现在走吧
Now time to go.

36:56.850 --> 36:58.820
送苏特先生出去
Escort Mr. Sooter out.

37:08.350 --> 37:10.650
我数到5
I'm gonna count to five.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.230
1
One.

37:14.030 --> 37:15.280
2
Two.

37:16.280 --> 37:17.130
3
Three.

37:32.780 --> 37:34.780
将军要见你们
You've got an appointment with General.

37:51.780 --> 37:54.210
给你
Here you go.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.550
在这等
Wait right here.

38:31.580 --> 38:33.780
久违了  格雷琴
Been a long time, Gretchen.

38:33.850 --> 38:36.280
不为将军卖命了吗
No longer working for the General?

38:36.350 --> 38:37.910
没错
Correct.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.850
他是谁
Who's he?

38:39.910 --> 38:41.710
"锡拉"在我手里
I'm the guy that's holding Scylla.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.350
有兴趣吗
You interested?

38:43.410 --> 38:46.750
将军可给了一笔赏金
Well, the General has offered a reward for anyone

38:46.810 --> 38:48.010
奖赏能把"锡拉"
who can return Scylla

38:48.080 --> 38:50.950
和叛徒的人头带回去的人
along with the heads of the transgressors.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.280
我很感激你给我机会
I appreciate you allowing me the opportunity

38:55.350 --> 38:57.410
打击一下将军
to kick the General in the teeth.

38:58.350 --> 38:59.180
能看看吗
Can I see it?

39:21.680 --> 39:23.650
所有人
All of you.

39:26.250 --> 39:28.210
苏特  拜托  我不会把你说出去
Sooter, please, I can give you cover.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.480
省省吧  议员
Save it! Save it, Senator, save it.

39:30.550 --> 39:33.780
将军特别交待要把你活着带过去
The General specifically asked that I bring you in alive.

39:33.850 --> 39:36.180
快走
Just move.

39:44.210 --> 39:46.410
你差点害死我们  议员
You were going to kill us, Senator.

39:46.480 --> 39:49.010
是斯坦顿打的电话
It was Stanton who made that call.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.010
30秒前的复杂形势
Look, what was extremely complicated

39:51.080 --> 39:54.410
现在已不复存在
30 seconds ago is not so now.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.050
6个人知道这次行动
There were six people who knew

39:56.110 --> 39:57.680
2个还活着
about this operation. Two of them are still alive.

39:57.750 --> 39:59.610
一个跑了  我是另一个
One is now on the run. and I'm the other.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.650
我会守口如瓶
And I'm not saying a word.

40:01.710 --> 40:03.250
你休想轻易脱身  议员
You're not getting off that easy, Senator.

40:03.310 --> 40:05.380
你要帮我们
You are going to help us.

40:08.710 --> 40:11.810
会议桌上有个手提包
There is a folder in that briefcase

40:11.880 --> 40:13.310
包里有份文件
on the conference table.

40:13.380 --> 40:14.410
里面记录了
It contains

40:14.480 --> 40:16.680
这次行动的遗留问题
the last remnants of this operation.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.610
一旦你们把它处理掉
Once you dispose of it

40:18.680 --> 40:21.850
一切都不会发生
none of this ever existed.

40:21.910 --> 40:23.550
这是秘密行动的
That's the saving grace

40:23.610 --> 40:24.750
的好处
of a covert operation.

40:24.810 --> 40:26.080
如果你们想要
If you want...

40:27.680 --> 40:30.550
可以当作没发生过
...it never happened.

40:33.250 --> 40:36.280
我现在要走了
I'm going to walk away now.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.510
赶一趟航班

40:38.580 --> 40:40.280
可能在我妻子

40:40.350 --> 40:42.250
睡觉前能赶到
before she goes to bed.

40:44.310 --> 40:46.510
我只希望出去时
I only hope I don't catch a bullet in the back

40:46.580 --> 40:47.550
不会背后来一枪
on my way out.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.780
我很抱歉  先生们
I'm really very sorry, gentlemen.

40:54.580 --> 40:56.580

41:15.480 --> 41:17.380

41:17.450 --> 41:18.910
你要是再这么做
I will kill you myself

41:18.980 --> 41:21.110
我会杀了我自己的
the next time you do something like that.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.450
马宏在哪
Where's Mahone?

41:26.510 --> 41:28.980
他不见了
He's gone.

41:42.210 --> 41:44.150
你把"锡拉"搞全了
Well, we can do business

41:44.210 --> 41:45.780
我们再交易
when you get the rest of Scylla.

41:45.850 --> 41:48.650
你说什么
What are you talking about?

41:50.210 --> 41:52.280
这是不完整的
It's incomplete.

41:52.350 --> 41:53.380
不完整  什么
Incom...? Wha--

41:53.450 --> 41:54.480
玩什么把戏
Who is this clown?

41:54.550 --> 41:56.280
-把戏  -对  把戏
Clown? Yeah, clown.

41:56.350 --> 42:00.550
