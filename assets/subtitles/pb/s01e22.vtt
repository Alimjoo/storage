WEBVTT

00:03.700 --> 00:05.700
知道我们队伍里危机四伏吧
You got a couple foxes in your hen house, right

00:05.800 --> 00:07.100
他们都想出去
They both want out of here.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.300
在出去前他们不会惹麻烦的
They'll behave until then.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.400
听着 情况就是这样严峻
Look, this is it, man.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.900
这次根本没有推翻重来的机会
Ain't no do-overs this time.

00:11.100 --> 00:11.900
我们今晚就越狱
We break out tonight

00:12.500 --> 00:13.600
要不然就永远出不去了
or we ain't never getting out

00:16.600 --> 00:18.400
这都是斯科菲尔德一手策划的吧
Brains of the outfit, huh, Scofield

00:20.100 --> 00:22.000
他正引领你们走向深渊
He's leading you off a cliff, boys

00:22.400 --> 00:24.700
听上去你还是这儿的负责人
Now you're acting like you still in charge.

00:25.000 --> 00:25.900
就当我不在场
Pretend I ain't here.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.100
是啊 也可以假装你不会用对讲机报警
Yeah, you and the radio.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.900
有件事情我还没搞清楚
The thing I can't quite figure is

00:34.000 --> 00:36.800
事情现在闹得这么大
with the crap storm this thing's become

00:37.300 --> 00:38.900
他们为什么还没有杀了你
why they haven't killed you.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.500
我们有个员工表现不怎么的
We have an employee. She's not working out.

00:42.300 --> 00:42.900
我们炒了她鱿鱼
We fire her.

00:43.800 --> 00:44.800
就应该处理地这么简单
It needs to be that simple.

00:44.900 --> 00:47.100
她毕竟是美利坚合众国的副总统啊
She's the Vice President of the United States.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.600
她当不了多久了 吉姆
And that's all she'll ever be, Jim.

00:49.000 --> 00:49.800
你要对我怎么样?
What's going on?

00:50.200 --> 00:51.600
去布莱克福特把斯蒂德曼找出来
You get to Blackfoot, you find Steadman.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.700
就请你再给我次机会
Just give me a chance.

00:54.100 --> 00:54.700
不要!
No!

00:55.100 --> 00:55.800
律师在哪里?
Where's the lawyer?

01:03.200 --> 01:03.900
我们成功了
We're through.

01:23.900 --> 01:24.800
老家伙 你还撑的住吗
You okay, old man

01:25.000 --> 01:25.600
我不行了
No!

01:27.000 --> 01:27.500
天哪
Oh, my God!

01:29.400 --> 01:30.100
快拉警报
Sound the alarm.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.100
快啊 迈克尔
Come on Michael!

01:31.500 --> 01:32.300
快拉警报
Sound the alarm!

01:32.700 --> 01:33.200
快啊
Come on!

01:35.800 --> 01:36.400
再加把劲
Come on!

01:40.600 --> 01:42.000
迈克尔 用力爬啊
Michael come on move it!

01:46.800 --> 01:47.700
抓住我的手
Michael grab my hand!

01:49.400 --> 01:50.300
抓住我的手...
Grab my hand.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.400
求求你 别开枪!
Don't shoot please!

02:24.600 --> 02:25.300
别开枪
Don't shoot!

02:25.400 --> 02:25.900
我们抓住了一个逃犯
We got a 10-98! Inmates over the wall!

02:26.000 --> 02:26.900
其他同伙都翻出墙跑了
Inmates over the wall!

02:29.000 --> 02:31.200
还有谁
Who was with you? Who was with you?

02:31.300 --> 02:32.100
没有了
Nobody!

02:32.500 --> 02:33.500
-没有人 是吧?  -没有人
-Nobody huh?   -No.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.500
快招 不然我对天发誓
Talk or I swear to God 

02:35.600 --> 02:36.500
我现在就把你脑袋拧下来
I'll snap your neck right here!

02:37.900 --> 02:38.600
我真的不知道
I don't know! I don't know!

02:39.900 --> 02:41.500
快报上其他人的姓名
Names. I want names.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.500
斯科菲尔德
Scofield...

02:45.700 --> 02:48.500
布伦斯 苏克雷
Burrows Sucre.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.900
还有那个小毛贼
And that Vanilla Ice kid.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.000
还有谁
Who else?

02:53.300 --> 02:54.500
博格威尔
Bagwell man.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.300
希诺特
C-Note.

02:56.900 --> 02:57.800
阿布鲁奇
Abruzzi.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.500
还有那个神经病
And that bug-eyed J-Cat...

03:00.900 --> 03:02.100
还有谁
Was there anybody else?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.300
快说还有谁
Was there anybody else?

03:08.600 --> 03:09.800
韦斯特莫兰德
Westmoreland.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.100
报告 有人越狱跑了
We got inmates over the wall. Repeat.

03:19.900 --> 03:20.600
多少人
How many?

03:20.700 --> 03:21.200
八个
Eight

04:26.900 --> 04:27.400
报告狱长
Warden

04:28.200 --> 04:29.100
刚刚找到贝利克了
they just found Bellick.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.100
把霰弹枪给我
Get me my shotgun.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.000
珀尔已经给所有的狱警布置任务了
Pope's already given orders for all the COs to hit the streets.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.200
你聋了吗
Did I stutter

04:40.000 --> 04:41.500
把霰弹枪给我
Get me my shotgun!

04:45.100 --> 04:45.800
这帮兔崽子
Those piles of crap 

04:45.900 --> 04:47.100
这么对待我
doing what they just did 

04:47.300 --> 04:48.700
他们死定了
they just signed their death warrant.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.800
谁都别想跑
Every last one of them.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.900
那些逃犯翻墙出去的时候
When those men went over the wall 

05:02.000 --> 05:03.100
已经做出了选择
they made a choice.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.400
这个选择使他们再次成为社会安定的威胁
That choice makes them a threat to society once again.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.100
正如你们所知道的那样
Now as many of you know 

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
他们中的有些人已经被判杀人罪
some of those men are convicted killers.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.600
我们现在要站出来
Now our job

05:14.900 --> 05:17.500
确保整个社会的安稳
is to protect and ensure the safety of the general population

05:18.900 --> 05:22.100
意味着如果需要击毙他们来确保社会安全
That means if we have to bring them down to ensure that safety 

05:22.200 --> 05:23.900
看在上帝的份上那就那么做吧!
by God we will do it!

05:25.100 --> 05:26.900
同志们 这次我们可是来真的了
This time we're playing for keeps gentlemen

05:28.200 --> 05:29.600
现在离他们翻墙而出
Now it's been at least 12 minutes

05:29.700 --> 05:30.700
至少有12分钟了
since they went over that wall.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.600
他们徒步最多逃到一英里外
That's one mile on foot at best.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.200
如果有车子帮忙的话
If they've got their hands on a vehicle 

05:35.300 --> 05:37.000
可能已经逃到十英里开外了
they could be 10 miles from here.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.700
所以大家马上行动起来
So let's get moving!

06:08.200 --> 06:08.700
兄弟 抓紧时间
Yo come on man 

06:08.800 --> 06:09.800
我们得动起来
we gotta roll.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.700
我们什么也不用做就等在这儿
We don't got to do anything but wait right here

06:13.200 --> 06:14.700
让他们赶在我们前头好了
and let them get ahead of us.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.300
我不知道这样我们还有机会逃成功吗
I don't know if we're gonna get a chance papi.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.900
靠 有警犬
Dogs. Son of a bitch.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.300
他们正朝我们过来
They're coming right for us.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
都不要动
Nobody move.

06:30.900 --> 06:31.900
他们闻不到我们
They can't smell us.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.200
但是他们能看到我们
But they can see us.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.400
你好 我现在有事不能接听你的电话
Hey this is Nick. Can't get to the phone.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.200
请留言
Leave a message.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.200
尼克 是我啊
Hey Nick it's me.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.600
听着 我刚刚抵达蒙大拿
Look I just landed in Montana.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.400
现在我正在去布莱克福特的路上
I'm about an hour outside of Blackfoot.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.700
那幢房子
And this house 

07:46.800 --> 07:48.700
肯定和特伦斯·斯蒂德曼凶杀案有关
it's got something to do with Terrence Steadman's murder 

07:48.800 --> 07:49.500
我确定
I know it.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.800
如果在这儿能发现任何线索证明林肯的清白
And if whatever's here can help free Lincoln 

07:52.000 --> 07:54.400
我想对你说声谢谢
then I wanted to say thank you.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.400
有钱能使鬼推磨
Soft money makes the world go round.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.000
你知我知
You know it and I know it.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.100
你削减了我的竞选经费
You cut my funding

08:04.200 --> 08:06.900
我就没办法很好地参与竞选
and I can't run a proper campaign without it.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.300
相信我 公司内部对竞选款争议颇多
There was a lot of internal debate trust me.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.100
你完全可以凭借演说辞竞选成功
And there's every chance that you can still win with your message 

08:12.200 --> 08:15.400
-那样这笔钱就白白浪费了...  -噢 别再废话连篇了
-and it would certainly be our loss...  -Oh cut the crap.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
你还有什么想告诉我的吗
Is there anything else you want to tell me 

08:18.500 --> 08:22.100
还是说 你来这里是只是想落井下石
or did you just come here to twist the knife you stuck in my back?

08:22.200 --> 08:23.000
好吧 事实上
Well actually 

08:23.200 --> 08:25.600
我来这儿是为了致谢
I came here to express our gratitude

08:25.700 --> 08:27.700
感谢这些年来你为我们所作出的贡献
for all that you've done for us over the years.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.000
你要明白这不是私人间的致谢
And to let you know that this isn't personal.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.900
-当然你在政界摸爬滚打多年肯定能明白  -听着
-Surely you've been in politics long enough to know that.  -Look 

08:34.400 --> 08:35.900
是不是因为能源法令的原故?
is this about the energy bill?

08:36.300 --> 08:38.200
和能源法 毫不相关
The energy bill has nothing to do with it.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.400
为什么我觉得那么难以置信呢?
Why am I finding that so tough to believe?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.100
我是成年人
I'm a grown woman.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.300
不如你直截了当地挑明吧
How about you give it to me straight?

08:48.900 --> 08:49.600
好啊
All right.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.200
好啊
All right.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.000
根本问题是
The bottom line 

08:54.100 --> 08:55.300
副总统女士
Madam Vice President 

08:55.400 --> 08:58.600
根本问题是你对白宫没有影响力
is that you can't effect change in the Oval Office.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.200
而那正是我们最迫切需要的
And that is what we need the most.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.200
发言人
Certitude.

09:03.600 --> 09:04.400
简单地说
Simply put

09:05.800 --> 09:07.100
你能力有限
you can't get things done.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.600
或许你对我还不够了解
Well maybe you don't know me so well.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.000
我强烈建议在接下去的几周里
I highly suggest that in the coming weeks 

09:22.200 --> 09:25.100
随着竞选越来越激烈 候选人开始逐一退出...
as the race narrows and the candidates start falling out 

09:26.400 --> 09:27.300
你也能够退出竞选
that you walk away 

09:27.600 --> 09:28.400
非常安静地退出
quietly 

09:28.700 --> 09:29.800
自意地退出
of your own volition.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.500
不然的话 或许
Otherwise maybe

09:33.700 --> 09:35.000
公司会强迫你退出
it'll be of The Company's volition.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.500
你把衣服脱掉
Hey hey take the suit off.

09:52.700 --> 09:53.400
在夜色中 你特别显眼
You're practically glowing in the dark.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.500
-我里面只穿了内衣  -快脱掉!
-I only got my Skivvies on underneath.  -Take the suit off!

09:55.600 --> 09:56.300
我会冻死的
I'll freeze to death!

09:56.400 --> 09:57.900
抓紧
Hurry up.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.800
-我们必须对那疯子采取点行动  -你说得对
-We got to do something about that freak.  -You got it dude.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.700
快 动作快点 抓紧时间
Come on. Come on hurry up. Hurry up.

10:14.000 --> 10:14.700
车在哪
Where the hell is the van?

10:16.800 --> 10:19.300
车到底在哪
Eyetie where in the hell is the van?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.400
给我点信任好不好
Ye of little faith.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.300
来 来吧
Come on come on.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.000
看 在那 我告诉过你
I told you. I told you.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.100
你来开车 克鲁马努人
Behind the wheel Cro-Magnon.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.100
别闹
Hey hey hey

10:51.700 --> 10:52.400
你在那干嘛
What the hell are you doing

10:53.100 --> 10:54.300
我在让我们不易察觉
I'm getting us invisible.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.300
约翰 车钥匙呢
John where are the keys

11:07.400 --> 11:08.600
-什么  -我问你钥匙在哪里
-What  -The keys where are they

11:08.700 --> 11:11.600
我告诉过你 在树旁垃圾筒内的塑料袋里
I told you in the garbage can by the trees in a plastic bag.

11:11.900 --> 11:12.400
那你还等什么
What are you waiting for

11:12.500 --> 11:15.500
去 快去找钥匙
Come on come on.

11:37.700 --> 11:40.300
不 不
No! No no no!

11:41.400 --> 11:42.600
不!
No!

11:48.000 --> 11:50.200
我们对55和80号高速实行全程监控
We got the on-ramps to 55 and 80 being monitored.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.600
在171 6和53号路口设置了检查站
We've got traffic checks on 171 6 and 53.

11:53.700 --> 11:57.100
在奥海尔和中途都有特别部门监控来往过客的名单
Special Services has secured a watch on passenger lists at O'Hare and Midway.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.400
电话监控安排了没有?
How are we doing with the wiretaps?

11:58.500 --> 12:01.200
所有越狱者家里都安装了窃听器
They're being set up on all the family members of the escapees as we speak.

12:01.300 --> 12:04.000
监控小组也正在住所外围布控
Surveillance teams are being established outside the residences as well.

12:04.100 --> 12:04.600
谢谢
Thank you.

12:06.100 --> 12:06.600
你发现了什么线索?
What do you got?

12:07.100 --> 12:08.400
门不是被撬开的
Door wasn't forced.

12:08.700 --> 12:09.900
锁也没有被凿过
Lock wasn't picked.

12:11.100 --> 12:11.900
就目前情况来看
As far as I can tell 

12:12.000 --> 12:13.400
他们基本上就是走进去的
they basically just walked right in.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.500
我不明白这怎么可能
I don't see how that's possible.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.800
这门每天下班后都是锁上的
These doors are locked down every night when we leave

12:16.900 --> 12:18.100
这是第一要务
It's priority number one.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.900
我唯一能想到的就是
Only thing I can think is...

12:20.800 --> 12:21.300
是什么?
What?

12:21.900 --> 12:23.400
有人故意不锁为他们开着
Someone left it open for them.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.900
约翰 我不得不问你
Hey John I've got to ask you

12:37.500 --> 12:39.400
你为什么这么坚持林肯来开车
why you were so intent on Lincoln driving here

12:39.500 --> 12:41.900
还有你为什么挑了这么个特别的位置?
and you taking that particular seat?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.800
你座位下到底有什么东西?
Now what is it exactly you got up underneath there huh?

12:53.200 --> 12:54.300
你他妈的在干嘛
What the hell are you doing

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
你认为这么做就能让我停手?
You think that will stop me huh?

12:56.800 --> 12:59.700
好好再想想吧
Think twice Johnny boy.

13:00.200 --> 13:00.900
你杀了我
You shoot me pretty here

13:01.300 --> 13:04.400
那他就要拖着170磅的尸体做伴了
pretty here will be dragging around 170 pounds of dead Alabama flesh with him.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.100
你想想
And considering

13:05.200 --> 13:08.500
他对你完成复仇菲波纳奇有多重要...
how much you need him to get this little Fibonacci vendetta of yours...

13:09.700 --> 13:11.500
所以你最好不要扣动扳机
So I just don't think you're gonna be pulling that trigger.

13:16.200 --> 13:16.700
不吗
No?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.900
快把手铐的钥匙给我 死变态 
You're gonna give me the key to those cuffs T-bag.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.200
你这狗娘养的

13:30.500 --> 13:32.000
找找看
Get it get it. Get it.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.400
你在找这个吗

13:59.000 --> 14:02.600
蛤蚌毒素配糖混合制剂在血液中立刻起作用
This glycoside saxitoxin hybrid goes to work in the blood stream instantly.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.950
体质再好 心肌再强
Five minutes is the outside limit even

14:06.950 --> 14:09.200
的人也撑不过五分钟
the strongest cardiac muscles can continue to function.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.100
再然后
After that 

14:11.100 --> 14:14.100
就算神仙也回天乏术了
massive cardiac arrest with no chance of survival.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.600
能通过毒素测试吗
What about toxicology tests?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.100
放心 什么也检查不出来
Well they'll reveal nothing.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.100
死因只能归咎为自然疾病
Death will appear to be from natural causes.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.800
这可是很重的叛国罪
This is high treason.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.200
你不会不知道吧
You know that don't you?

14:46.300 --> 14:47.000
血迹未干 长官
It's fresh boss.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.500
对 是的

15:11.200 --> 15:12.000
什么样的车?
What did it look like?

15:12.300 --> 15:14.600
像部厢式货车
Like a... Like a van.

15:15.100 --> 15:15.800
蓝色的厢式货车
A blue van.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.400
你就没有想过向当局报案?
And you didn't think to report it to the authorities?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.100
一辆停着的车?
A parked car?

15:32.900 --> 15:36.700
如果你觉得我不会亲手把你肠子割断取出钥匙
If you think I won't gut you myself to get that key 

15:36.700 --> 15:38.400
那就看看会给你什么惊喜吧
you're in for a big surprise.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.700
我建议你回想一下上次你冲我动刀的情形
I encourage you to remember the last time you came at me with a knife.

15:41.700 --> 15:42.600
闭嘴!
Shut up!

15:42.600 --> 15:43.600
快闭嘴!
Shut up!

15:43.600 --> 15:45.400
你们两个都给我闭嘴!
Both of you!

15:45.400 --> 15:47.000
你们可以到墨西哥后再作个了断
You can settle this in Mexico.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.900
离飞机跑道还有多远?
How far to the airstrip?

15:48.900 --> 15:50.700
大概还有5英里
I guess five miles maybe.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.200
黑老大 你的飞机最好在那停着
You know your jet better be there Mr. Mafia.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.500
你明白我的意思吗

15:59.500 --> 16:01.100
确保飞机在那儿

16:11.800 --> 16:13.800
警犬布置完毕

16:13.800 --> 16:15.000

16:16.000 --> 16:19.500
尽量缩小搜查范围
Push past the search perimeter before we can pick up track. Over.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.200
周围到处都是警察
They're everywhere out there.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.000
还用你来说
Tell me something I don' t know.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.000
你是说你对此一无所知?
You're saying you don't know anything about this?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.700
我真的不知道
Honestly I don't.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.400
门没有上锁 卡蒂
The door was left open Katie.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.400
不是我干的
It wasn't me.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.100
那是谁?
Well then who was it?

16:38.100 --> 16:40.700
只有你和唐克雷蒂医生在晚上离开那儿
Only you and Dr. Tancredi were left at the end of the night.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.000
值班人员确认过这件事

16:42.000 --> 16:43.600
不是我
It wasn't me.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.000
那你就是说唐克雷蒂医生干的?
Then you're telling me it was Dr. Tancredi?

16:45.000 --> 16:45.900
不
No...

16:49.500 --> 16:51.900
我知道你觉察到什么了 卡蒂
I know you know something Katie.

16:51.900 --> 16:52.800
把任何你知道的事情
And anything you know 

16:52.800 --> 16:53.900
统统告诉我
you have got to tell me.

16:53.900 --> 16:54.400
如果不告诉我的话
If you don't 

16:54.400 --> 16:57.500
你失去的将不仅仅是工作
you are gonna lose a lot more than your job.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.600
知情不报会让你成为同谋犯
Withholding information makes you an accessory.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.500
如果你再不说的话我就按铃报警了!
And I will press that button if you don't start talking!

17:07.200 --> 17:08.300
莎拉
Sara

17:08.300 --> 17:09.800
莎拉怎么了
What about Sarah

17:19.600 --> 17:20.900
谢谢你 卡蒂
Thank you Katie.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.500
我只想摸摸她的肚子
All I want to do is touch her belly 

17:31.000 --> 17:32.700
感受一下小生命的存在
feel that he's in there.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.800
这之后
After that 

17:38.100 --> 17:39.000
随便让我干什么
whatever I got to do I'll figure it out.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.700
我都愿意去做
I'll figure it out.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.300
我就是想摸摸她的肚子
I just want to touch her belly.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.500

17:47.600 --> 17:48.900
糟了 有麻烦了

18:07.000 --> 18:08.100
这太疯狂了
Yo dawg man this is bananas.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.500
我们必须离开这条道
We got to get off this road.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.500
还有其他路可以到机场吗
Any other way to the airstrip

18:10.500 --> 18:11.400
就只有这条路
This is the only road.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.800
那我们就跑吧
Then let's just run this bitch.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.100
谁让他闭嘴
Somebody shut him up 

18:14.100 --> 18:15.300
还是我自己来
or I will.

18:15.300 --> 18:16.000
我们能回去吗
Can we go back

18:16.000 --> 18:18.300
那对我们没有任何好处
That won't do us any good.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.300
这只会让我们越来越远离目的地
It'll only get us farther from where we need to be.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.600
那意味着我们必须冲过那个路障
Which means we got to bust that roadblock.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.200
或许不用
Maybe not.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.900
我们可以试着绕路走
We've got to try and go around.

18:26.700 --> 18:27.700
来吧
Come on.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.300
我们会从你这拿到钥匙的
We're gonna get that key from you.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.000
我才不管你是用拉出来还是什么的
I don't care if you got to crap it out.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.700
你有时候嘴很臭 小子
You got a foul mouth sometimes pretty.

18:49.400 --> 18:50.500
怎么了?
What?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.700
靠 轮胎陷进去了!
Son of a bitch we're stuck!

18:54.700 --> 18:57.500
大家都出去
Everybody out. Everybody out.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.800
这是为今晚演讲准备的吗
This for the speech tonight

19:07.500 --> 19:08.800
出示证件

Have at it.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.500
用力

19:24.200 --> 19:25.300
这车没指望了
This thing ain't going nowhere!

19:25.300 --> 19:26.400
离机场还有多远?
How far is the airstrip?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.300
徒步?
On foot?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.200
或许2英里
Maybe two miles.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.400
那我们还等什么?
What the hell are we waiting for?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.100
赶紧跑啊
Let's move.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.400
三只脚竞走可跑不快啊
Three-legged race over here ain't going to make it 10 feet.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.700
我们行的 不是吗?
We'll manage won't we?

19:33.700 --> 19:35.100
那当然
Sure pretty.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.200
我们是队友
We're teammates.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.400
永远的队友
Teammates till the end.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.100
让我们离开这
Let's get out of here!

19:38.100 --> 19:39.100
出发
Let's go!

19:39.100 --> 19:39.900

19:39.900 --> 19:40.900

你就只能跟到这了
This is as far as you go my friend.

19:43.700 --> 19:44.900
什么

19:44.900 --> 19:46.700
不行 你不能在这丢下我 不该这样的
No man you can't leave me out here not like this.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.300
我们说好了 记得吗
We had a deal remember

19:50.600 --> 19:51.600
对 但是别这样 好兄弟
Yeah but come on bro.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.100
你和我
You and I 

19:53.100 --> 19:54.700
我们可不是什么兄弟
we're not bros.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.900
要不要我通知他们你和警察的事情
And I don't think you want me telling the guys what I know.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.900
滚开
Now walk.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.900
我们有麻烦了
We got trouble pretty.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.200

20:18.200 --> 20:19.300
跟上
Come on!

20:36.400 --> 20:37.800

20:39.700 --> 20:41.000
现在怎么办
Now what?

20:41.000 --> 20:41.800
走不了了
What do we do now Michael?

20:41.800 --> 20:42.300
我真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.700
怎么办
What now

21:10.000 --> 21:12.200
长官 检查完毕 未发现目标
This area clear. Negative contact.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.800
又回来了 又回来了
It's coming back y'all it's coming back!

21:28.900 --> 21:30.600
注意隐蔽
Make yourself small.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.800
像这样我们根本走不了2英里
There's no way we are gonna make two miles like this.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.600
特别上面还有这么大只鸟
Especially with that bird up there.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.600
如果想想办法说不定可以
We are if I got something to do with it.

22:32.700 --> 22:33.800
打搅一下
Excuse me.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.200
有什么能帮你的吗
What can I do for you?

22:36.700 --> 22:39.100
我正想问同样的问题呢
Sort of was gonna ask you the same question.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.600
我白天负责瞭望塔
I run the tower during the day.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.600
日落后这儿就不许通航了
There's no traffic allowed here after sundown.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.200
飞机出了机械故障
Had some mechanical problems.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.600
需要我帮忙看看吗
You need me to take a look at anything?

22:45.600 --> 22:47.200
不 不用 我们自己能解决
No no we got it.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.900
不用麻烦你了
Don't trouble yourself.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.300
我们马上就离开
We'll be on our way in no time.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.500
你肯定吗
You sure?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.800
绝对
Positive.

22:55.300 --> 22:56.400
好吧
Okay.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.800
老兄 祝你晚安
Have a good night hey buddy?

22:57.800 --> 22:58.800
同祝晚安
Yeah you too.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.200
那些家伙最好抓紧时间
Those guys better hurry up.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.200
是我
Hey it's me.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.500
我在高斯公园发现一不明身份飞机
I've got an unidentified aircraft here at Goose Park.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.100
最好你们来看看
I think you better have a look at it.

23:18.100 --> 23:21.600
尾翼号码是986D
Tail number's 986-Delta.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.400
动作快点
Hurry up

23:26.400 --> 23:27.600
大水缸
Tranquilo

23:27.600 --> 23:30.100
就让我用小魔力来安心干活 好不好?
Just let papi work a little bit of his magic okay?

23:30.100 --> 23:31.400
你知道你在干吗
You know what you're doing?

23:31.400 --> 23:32.500
你在笑话我?
Are you kidding me?

23:32.500 --> 23:35.000
捣鼓这个对我来说就像摆弄烤箱
Hot-wiring this thing is like hot-wiring a toaster.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.200
当然 如果这中间还有什么插曲
Now if it were to be an Acura 

23:36.200 --> 23:37.400
或者是中国车
or one of those Chinese cars 

23:37.400 --> 23:39.400
那就完全不同了
that's a whole different story.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.300
电子点火装置
Electronic ignition 

23:41.300 --> 23:43.000
电脑芯片 统统不考虑
computer chips forget about it.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.100
不管怎样 我们快成功了
But no we're good.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.100
直升机马上会回来的 所以动作快点
Well that chopper's gonna be coming back again so hurry up.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.000
墨西哥怎么样
Hey yo. What they got in Mexico anyhow

24:04.700 --> 24:06.500
你从没有去过
You never been there

24:06.500 --> 24:10.100
除了伊拉克 唐人街和Fox River监狱
Ain't never been nowhere

24:10.100 --> 24:12.100
我哪儿都没有去过
except for Iraq Chi-Town and Fox River.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.500
你看什么看?
What you looking at?

24:17.600 --> 24:19.100
听着
Look man 

24:21.400 --> 24:23.700
有没有个地方可以容你安个家?
is it a good place where you can have a family?

24:25.900 --> 24:27.800
那儿有很多家庭
Lots of families down there 

24:27.800 --> 24:28.900
据我所知
so I hear.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.100
你知道我在说什么吗
Man you know what I'm talking about.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.100
能给一个黑人
For a black man 

24:33.500 --> 24:36.400
给一个美国人安家
an American man with a family.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.900
这就是你计划?
So that's the plan huh?

24:38.600 --> 24:40.700
让他们去墨西哥找你?
They're gonna meet you down in Mexico?

24:41.900 --> 24:44.300
是啊 比不见他们更糟糕
Yeah it's worse to not see them.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.500
我再也不能这么下去了
And I can't do that no more.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.000
对他们来说这根本不算什么生活
Not much of a life for them.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.700
但起码也算得上是过日子
But it'll be a life.

24:52.600 --> 24:56.700
日子肯定会比过去的两年好
More than what me and them have been having for the last two years man.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.100
他们是我的家人
They're family snowflake.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.100
我不可能撇下他们不管
Ain't no way in hell I'm leaving them behind.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.100
差不多成了
We're good.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.800
对付这我绰绰有余
I must have done this a thousand times.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.100
我觉得你更适合武装抢劫
Man I thought you got busted for armed robbery.

25:16.100 --> 25:17.900
那就是他们逮捕我的原因
That's what they caught me for.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.800
红色的是火线
Red's the juice 

25:20.800 --> 25:22.200
白色的是地线
white is the ground.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.900
把他们接到一块
You strike them together

25:23.900 --> 25:26.000
这样我们就能离开这
and we blow this town.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.100
