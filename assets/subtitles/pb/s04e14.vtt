00:01.200 --> 00:02.870
《越狱》  前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

00:02.870 --> 00:05.050
你得了下丘脑错构瘤
You have hypothalamus Hamartoma,

00:05.050 --> 00:06.790
医生认为你需要手术
the doctor feels you need surgery

00:06.810 --> 00:08.130
否则  你会死
Otherwise you could die

00:08.130 --> 00:09.680
你不听命令吗
You are not following direct orders?

00:09.680 --> 00:12.000
我听命令  长官
Oh, I'm following direct orders, sir.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.100
只不过不听你的了
Just not from you anymore.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.240
如果不是你  我就死在这张桌子上了
I would've died on this table if it weren't for you, Doc.

00:17.240 --> 00:19.000
干嘛
What?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.600
该回家了
Time to come home now.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.570
你要帮我找一个新的买家
You're going to help me find a new buyer for Scylla.

00:22.570 --> 00:25.100
他叫怀肯  他不是买家  是个中间人
His name is Vikan, and he's not a buyer, he's a conduit.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.640
我们走吧
Let's go.

00:26.640 --> 00:27.740
巴格维尔留在这里
And Bagwell's staying here.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.500
我警告过你别耍我
I warned you not to screw me over.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.870
别来无恙  格雷琴  他是谁
It's been a long time, Gretchen. Who's he?

00:31.870 --> 00:33.370
"锡拉"在我手上
I'm the guy that's holding Scylla.

00:33.370 --> 00:36.870
这是不完整的  少了一个部件  小子
It's incomplete. There's a piece missing, slick.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.200
你好啊  唐
Hello, Don.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.670
我相信你拿了我的东西
I believe you have something that belongs to me.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.940
过来拿吧
Come and get it.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.540
你应该知道  这不是什么灵丹妙药
Just so it's fresh in your mind, this isn't a magic elixir.

00:58.540 --> 01:00.800
你还是要去医院
You still need a hospital.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.170
你需要真正的仪器
You need real equipment.

01:03.170 --> 01:05.200
或者找一个
Could probably use a doctor

01:05.200 --> 01:06.840
有医疗执照的医生
who's still got a license to practice medicine.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.840
首先  我们要找回"锡拉"
First we get Scylla.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.070
然后  我才去医院
Then I'll go to the hospital.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.400
你弄完了吗
You finished?

01:52.400 --> 01:54.700
差不多了
Just about.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.370
你现在准备说话了
So, I take it you're ready to talk now?

02:02.370 --> 02:03.770
事实上  我准备好和你见面了
Actually, I'm ready to meet.

02:03.770 --> 02:05.840
我有一个更好的主意
I got a better idea.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.670
所有人都出去
Everyone out!

02:25.570 --> 02:26.770
你被包围了
You're surrounded.

02:26.770 --> 02:29.270
把"锡拉"部件交出来  迈克尔
Come out with your piece of Scylla, Michael.

02:29.270 --> 02:30.540
你先交
You first.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.100
出来吧  不然  我就用烟把你们熏出来
Come out, or I'm going to gas you out.

02:34.100 --> 02:38.770
如果你们被熏出来  我有满满的一梭子子弹
If it's the latter, I have a full magazine with 30 rounds.

02:38.770 --> 02:41.300
想赌一把  看是不是有人跑得比你快
Want to bet at least one of them could outrun you?

02:41.300 --> 02:43.140
你凭什么认为  我把部件带在身上
What makes you think I'd even keep the piece on me?

02:43.140 --> 02:44.340
我了解你  迈克尔
Oh, I know you, Michael.

02:44.340 --> 02:46.070
你随身带着那块东西
You're not letting that thing out of your sight.

02:46.070 --> 02:48.000
我还是那句话
I stand by my original offer.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.100
过来拿吧
Come and get it.

02:49.100 --> 02:50.570
好吧
Okay.

02:54.570 --> 02:56.440
趴低点  等烟升到天花板
Stay low. Let the gas rise to the ceiling.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.670
这里空间很大  但是  在我们窒息前
This is a big space, but it won't take many more of those

02:58.670 --> 03:00.100
撑不了多久
before we start to asphyxiate.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.600
林肯在哪
Where's Lincoln?!

03:03.300 --> 03:06.070
还多着呢  迈克尔
Here we go, Michael.

《越狱》第四季 第十四集
Prison.Break.S04E14

03:49.340 --> 03:51.470
好了  我们现在开车去拿"锡拉"
All right, now we take a ride and we pick up Scylla.

03:51.470 --> 03:52.800
不然  我就一枪崩了你
Or I put a bullet in your head.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.170
不可能
It ain't gonna happen.

03:54.170 --> 03:55.600
试试看
Try me.

04:02.070 --> 04:03.800
大家早
Good morning.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.240
现在  大家都被枪指着
Okay, all right, now that we all have guns pointed at us,

04:09.240 --> 04:10.300
我们谈谈吧  好吗
let's talk, okay?

04:10.300 --> 04:11.670
说吧
Fine.

04:11.670 --> 04:15.700
你先告诉我  我到底是在和谁说话  是唐吗
You could start by telling me who I'm talking to, Don?

04:15.700 --> 04:17.270
我在过去17年里
You're talking to a guy who spent 17 years

04:17.270 --> 04:20.070
规规矩矩为政府卖命
in service of his government, all by the book.

04:20.070 --> 04:22.140
你知道  这些值多少钱吗
You know what the sum total of it was?

04:22.140 --> 04:23.870
一文不值  什么都不是
Nothing. Nada.

04:23.870 --> 04:25.370
我们是一类人  迈克尔
But we're very similar, Michael,

04:25.370 --> 04:26.700
而且  从根本来说  我们要的是同一样东西
and fundamentally, we want the same thing.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.370
我有方法拿到手
And I have a way to get it.

04:28.370 --> 04:29.770
什么意思
How's that?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.170
我找了一个"锡拉"买家
I got a buyer for Scylla.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.870
一个和你一样  想搞垮"公司"的人
A guy who wants to destroy the Company as much as you do.

04:33.870 --> 04:35.970
他愿意付一大笔钱
And he's willing to pay a lot of money for it.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.540
多少钱
How much?

04:37.540 --> 04:41.140
你选一个国外帐号  九位数
Nine figures in an offshore account of your choosing.

04:41.840 --> 04:42.900
就是这样
So, there it is.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.370
或者
Or...

04:44.370 --> 04:46.370
你可以继续按你的原则办事
you could stand by your principles.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.900
我不干
I'll pass.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.070
我是骗了你  我承认
Look, I burned you, right?

04:50.070 --> 04:52.070
我道歉  但是  有意义吗
And I'd apologize, but what's the point?

04:52.070 --> 04:55.240
我们的处境都很尴尬
We're all out in the cold now.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.270
但是  我们不可能一直躲着"公司"
But we're not going to be able to hide from the Company

04:56.270 --> 04:57.370
我们根本没有本钱
on a shoestring budget.

04:57.370 --> 04:58.570
谁是买家
Who's the buyer?

04:58.570 --> 05:00.270
他以前在"公司"做事  有过节
He's an ex-Company guy with a bone to pick.

05:00.270 --> 05:01.800
和你爸一样
Just like your father.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.900
迈克尔
Michael?

05:03.900 --> 05:07.370
我要先和他见面
I'd need to meet him first.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.700
可以安排
That can be arranged.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.570
只是想告诉你
And just so you know, this...

05:10.570 --> 05:12.740
这不是私人恩怨  只是笔交易
This wasn't personal. This is just business.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.540
我会和你联络的
We'll be in touch.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.770
我们还是按原计划行事
We stick to the plan, all right?

05:33.770 --> 05:35.270
我们会拿回"锡拉"
We're going to get Scylla.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.270
只要等阿历克斯那头打通关系
We wait for Alex to come through on his end.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.070
好吗
All right?

05:57.600 --> 05:59.200
你好  阿历克斯
Hello, Alex.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.170
你来了
You came.

06:02.170 --> 06:04.340
我一向遵守承诺
I always do,

06:04.340 --> 06:07.040
就算会被扣工钱
to the detriment of my pay grade.

06:08.940 --> 06:10.370
过去几个星期
These last few weeks,

06:10.370 --> 06:11.970
我参与了一起秘密行动
I've been part of an off-the-books operation

06:11.970 --> 06:13.940
是国安局安排的
under the hand of Homeland Security.

06:15.140 --> 06:17.200
费丽舍  和我共事的人
Felicia, the people I'm working with,

06:17.200 --> 06:18.770
我们就差那么一点
we're this close to coming up with

06:18.770 --> 06:20.440
就能得到摧毁"公司"的东西
the one thing that can destroy the Company:

06:20.440 --> 06:24.140
他们的黑皮书  我们能搞到手  里面有姓名  数字
their little black book. We can get it. Names, numbers.

06:24.140 --> 06:27.470
我可不想夹在部门间的斗争里
Look, I don't want to get caught up in some interagency politics.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.940
如果这次国安局的行动
So, if this is Homeland's show...

06:28.940 --> 06:31.870
国安局终止了行动  我们不能再回去了
Homeland buried the operation. We can't come back in.

06:31.870 --> 06:33.840
但是  我们还可以搞垮"公司"
But we could still take the Company down.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.870
所以  我的问题是
So, my question to you is:

06:35.870 --> 06:38.200
在联调局里  你认为可以信任谁
Who do you know in the Bureau that you can trust?

06:38.200 --> 06:40.140
以前是你  阿历克斯
It used to be you, Alex.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.170
过去几个月  我失去了很多东西
I've lost a lot of things these last few months,

06:44.170 --> 06:46.340
不止是你的信任
not the least of which is your trust.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.340
但我不是来乞求你的
But I don't come to you hat in hand.

06:48.340 --> 06:51.400
"锡拉"是存在的
Scylla is real.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.870
如果你不想扯上关系  我可以理解
But if you don't want anything to do with it, it's okay.

06:53.870 --> 06:56.770
没事  我可以离开
It's all right; I could walk away.

07:00.400 --> 07:04.900
有一个人也许能帮你
Yeah, there is someone who might be able to help.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.940
长官  洛杉矶有超过1千万人口
Sir, there are over ten million faces in Los Angeles.

07:12.940 --> 07:15.670
加上安全局和情报局的卫星  我们需要过滤
Even with NSA and CIA satellite links, we're going to be sifting

07:15.670 --> 07:17.870
几百万G的图像数据
through millions of gigabytes of image data.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.670
找到唐·赛尔夫
The chances of finding Don Self,

07:19.670 --> 07:21.670
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯的几率  不是很高
Scofield and Burrows... it's not good.

07:21.670 --> 07:23.000
让我们增加几率
Well, let's improve the odds.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.540
赛尔夫和兄弟俩
Self and the brothers

07:24.540 --> 07:26.540
是偷了"锡拉"  但是
may have stolen Scylla but none of them have

07:26.540 --> 07:28.200
他们没有任何办法出售
the connections to off-load it.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.440
在查找中加上格雷琴的脸
Add Gretchen's face to the search.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.140
她不可能是斯科菲尔德小组的一员
She won't be welcome in Scofield's camp.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.370
把她和赛尔夫的图像联系到一起
So, connect her image with Self's.

07:36.370 --> 07:38.940
如果在洛杉矶任何5尺距离内
We find those two within five feet of each other

07:38.940 --> 07:42.640
找到他们  我们就能找到"锡拉"
anywhere in Los Angeles, and we've found Scylla.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.870
你是格雷琴阿姨的朋友吗
Are you friends with my Auntie Gretchen?

07:56.070 --> 07:59.640
去你的房间玩  妈妈一会就过去
Go play in your room. Mommy will be in soon.

08:06.770 --> 08:09.300
她爸爸在哪
Where's her daddy?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.570
格雷琴从来不提及他
Gretchen doesn't talk about him.

08:12.570 --> 08:15.800
艾米丽还不知道你不是她的
So, Emily doesn't know that you ain't...

08:15.800 --> 08:18.470
格雷琴是她妈妈
That Gretchen's her mama?

08:18.470 --> 08:21.000
不  我宁愿保持这种方式
No, and I'd like to keep it that way.

08:28.970 --> 08:30.670
可爱的孩子
Cute girl.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.700
不要伤害我的孩子
Don't hurt my little girl.

08:36.970 --> 08:39.370
如果你要做什么  冲我来吧
If you have to do something, do it to me.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.900
你以为我是什么人
What do you think I am?

08:43.900 --> 08:45.770
野兽
A monster?

08:45.770 --> 08:48.570
你把我们囚禁在我们家里
You're holding us prisoner in our own home.

08:48.570 --> 08:52.270
我和你们一样  都是囚犯
I'm just as much a prisoner as you.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.200
奶白色  黑体字
Eggshell white. Bold lettering.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.570
双层浮花  我曾经是科尔·普发
Double embossed. I was Cole Pfeiffer.

09:01.570 --> 09:03.200
受人尊敬的商人
Respected businessman.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.400
东北区域最好的推销员
Top salesman in the Northeast Region.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.340
现在  我又变回过去的
Now I'm back being prisoner

09:10.340 --> 09:12.000
囚犯身份
of my own identity.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.040
帝博格·巴格维尔  罪犯
Theodore Bagwell. Convict.

09:18.640 --> 09:23.570
管他呢  江山易改  本性难移  对吧
To hell with it. We are who we are, right?

09:26.170 --> 09:28.170
你是卖什么的
What were you selling?

09:28.170 --> 09:30.500
你管不着
Never you mind.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.100
你只要祈祷你妹妹能脱险
You just pray your sister comes through.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.170
"公司"被搞垮  我们拿到钱
The Company gets destroyed  and we get paid.

09:37.170 --> 09:38.740
这买卖其实不错
It's a great deal.

09:38.740 --> 09:41.000
这个人只会是另一个克兰兹将军
This guy is just another General Krantz waiting to happen.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.140
假设我们把"锡拉"买给他  这个"公司"倒了
Let's say we do sell it to him and the Company burns,

09:43.140 --> 09:44.540
你知道接下来会怎样吗
You know what happens then?

09:44.540 --> 09:48.240
另一个"公司"会在前者之上建立
Another company is built right on top of that one.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.740
我们不卖
We're not selling.

10:01.260 --> 10:02.740
我进去了
I'm in.

10:02.740 --> 10:04.240
苏克雷搞定了
Sucre pulled it off.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.170
好极了
Great.

10:10.700 --> 10:12.620
找出地点
Get an address.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.140
有用吗
Is this going to work?

10:26.140 --> 10:27.240
这就象超声波
It's like an ultrasound.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.470
能透视所有东西
It can see through everything.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.260
你这是增大耐药量
You're building up a tolerance.

10:45.260 --> 10:48.000
那就加大剂量
Then we'll up the dosage.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.730
对  我增加了
Yeah, I have,

10:49.730 --> 10:51.060
但这样的话  大剂量会比肿瘤本身
and at this point, a higher dosage would have

10:51.060 --> 10:53.560
带来更多的副作用
more side effects than the tumor itself.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.600
我会尽量不用它
I'll manage without it.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.960
你坐在这等着
Sit this one out.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.500
让我和苏克雷来处理
Let me and Sucre handle it.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.860
我也去
I'm going.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.660
他怎么就不理解  我要结束这一切
Why can't he understand I need to finish this?

11:10.660 --> 11:12.300
所发生的一切
Everything that happened,

11:12.300 --> 11:14.630
都是"公司"引起的
it all started with the Company.

11:14.630 --> 11:17.000
也许林肯不这么认为
Maybe not for Lincoln.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.360
也许对他来说  这一切
Maybe for him, this all started

11:18.360 --> 11:21.000
是从他弟弟救他越狱开始的

很快  他就会走

我不知道我是否比一个被炒的联调员

18:20.230 --> 18:23.200
或一个被称为"公司"的神秘组织让人怀疑
or the mythical cabal known as the Company.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.830

Look what I found.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.560
问题是  没法用来射他们
Problem is, there's no way to shoot them.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.630
可以

19:48.630 --> 19:52.530

你们的任务是安全地拿回"锡拉"
Your mission is the safe retrieval of Scylla.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.000

Why don't you set up on that rooftop over there?

23:42.450 --> 23:43.750
"锡拉"已经快搞定了
Scylla's almost complete.

23:43.750 --> 23:44.850
你那头准备好了吗
Is everything ready on your end?

23:44.850 --> 23:46.250
让我跟格雷琴谈
Let me talk to Gretchen.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.720
不  你跟我谈

23:47.720 --> 23:49.650
买家已经到了
The buyer has touched down.

23:49.650 --> 23:51.720
他们可没耐性等你
This isn't the kind of person you keep waiting.

23:51.720 --> 23:52.950
我也一样
Likewise.

23:52.950 --> 23:54.280
让他们把钱准备好
Just make sure he has the money ready.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.650
听着  臭小子

你现在已在深水区
You're in the deep end of the pool now.

23:59.180 --> 24:01.720
下次打电话时  我要和格雷琴说话
And the next time I call, I want to talk to Gretchen.

24:02.980 --> 24:04.450
下次你打过来
The next time you call, it better be

24:04.450 --> 24:06.820

to tell me that the money's ready, you understand?

喂
Hello.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.820

How long ago?

24:19.580 --> 24:21.050
几分钟

25:24.150 --> 25:25.720
好的
Okay.

28:22.420 --> 28:27.120
迈克尔  就像我说的  这只是笔交易
Michael, like I said before, this is just business.

不许动
Don't move!

29:20.090 --> 29:21.250
那是什么
What is that?

29:21.250 --> 29:23.720
是仓库
It's the warehouse.

29:24.690 --> 29:26.220
那个芯片
The chip.

29:33.820 --> 29:35.190
你确定在这儿
You sure it's here?

29:35.420 --> 29:36.990
是  我确定

Look, don't be stupid, okay, Gretchen?

你能要回你的女儿和钱
You're gonna get your daughter back and your money.

30:11.020 --> 30:14.650
我在车上等你
I'll see you in the car.

他被带来时就这样
He was brought in like this.

30:31.050 --> 30:32.750
谁在那儿
Who's there?

我给他注射十毫升氯硝安定
I'm giving him 10cc's of clonazepam

30:36.350 --> 30:38.820
把他带到楼下  很快就有结果

30:45.720 --> 30:47.950
尽量放松
Try and relax.

31:14.690 --> 31:17.050
不用担心  我们会把迈克尔救回来的
Don't worry, we're gonna get Michael back.

31:17.050 --> 31:18.520
怎么救  赛尔夫把部件拿走了
How? Self took the piece.

31:18.520 --> 31:20.190
我们没有筹码做交换
We got nothing to trade for Michael.

31:20.190 --> 31:21.790
他病了  林肯
He's sick, Lincoln.

31:21.790 --> 31:24.420
如果他们还没杀他
If they haven't killed him already...

31:24.420 --> 31:26.850

We'll get him back, I promise.

31:28.950 --> 31:31.490

全部
All of it.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.420
什么
What?

31:46.420 --> 31:48.090
别说"锡拉"了
Just forget about Scylla.

31:48.090 --> 31:49.550
"公司"抓走了迈克尔
The Company's taken Michael.

31:49.550 --> 31:52.750
你在政府里的朋友  能帮忙救他吗
Your friend in government.can he do anything for him?

31:52.750 --> 31:55.020
不  他帮不上忙
No, I don't think so.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.850
你没理由再回来了  阿历克斯
There's no reason for you to come back, Alex.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.590
对不起
I'm sorry.

32:03.620 --> 32:05.990
我也很抱歉
Yeah, me, too.

32:16.390 --> 32:18.190
早就知道
Should have known.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.590
怀肯在这和我们见面吗
Vikan's meeting us here?

33:25.590 --> 33:27.820
"公司"的雷达监测不到这里
We'll be off the Company's radar here.

33:31.960 --> 33:33.090
喂
Yeah.

33:33.090 --> 33:34.460
我们有麻烦了
We got a problem.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.690
不管什么麻烦  都可以等
Well, whatever it is, it can wait.

33:35.690 --> 33:36.720
我们在最后关头了
We're in the home stretch here.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.090
带上她妹妹和女儿

33:38.090 --> 33:39.160
我会再打给你

谁
Who?

33:47.260 --> 33:48.590
我还不确定
I'm not sure yet.

33:48.590 --> 33:51.260
他可能是"公司"的人
He might be a Company operative.

33:51.260 --> 33:52.290
那就杀了他
So kill him.

33:52.290 --> 33:54.290
也可能只是个卖圣经的
He could also be a Bible salesman.

33:54.290 --> 33:55.690
那他进天堂
Then he should have no problem

33:55.690 --> 33:58.190
就没问题了  杀了他
getting past St. Peter. Kill him.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.560

我们以前一起
We used to... pray together

35:23.360 --> 35:25.390

我总是跪在地上哭泣
I used to go down to the floor crying

35:27.520 --> 35:29.120

有时  我再也受不了
Sometimes when I just couldn't take it no more,

我爸爸就会背一段
my daddy would recite a particular piece

35:36.020 --> 35:38.620
他喜欢的经文给我听
of Scripture that he was fond of...

35:38.620 --> 35:40.390
一宿
"Weeping

35:40.390 --> 35:44.860
虽有哭泣
may endure through the night..."

你之前
Have you seen

这事因我而起  也应由我结束
This started with me. It ends with me.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.480

39:45.880 --> 39:47.420

39:51.180 --> 39:52.820
买家已经在路上了
Buyer's already on the way.

39:52.820 --> 39:55.120
你以为我会给这小子
You think I'm going to give this clown 30%

39:55.120 --> 39:58.320
3成的介绍费吗
for just making introductions?

40:01.580 --> 40:04.480
怎么会错过玻璃门那所房
come on, how could you miss the glass door

40:06.350 --> 40:08.350

Okay, we'll be right out.
