01:05.800 --> 01:07.510
小子 你给个决斗的理由
Explain something to me, blanco,

01:07.520 --> 01:09.800
前一分钟 你刚为他捡回性命
One minute you plead for your friend's life,

01:10.120 --> 01:11.250
后一分钟 你又要结果了他
and the next minute you nt to take it.

01:11.260 --> 01:12.680
这家伙
This man

01:13.110 --> 01:15.380
这家伙根本不是我的朋友
this man is no friend of mine

01:15.390 --> 01:16.900
你女友发生的事情和我无关
What happened to your girlfriend has nothing

01:16.910 --> 01:18.600
她名字叫 莎拉
Her name was Sara

01:19.480 --> 01:21.060
她是个好人
And she was a good person.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.650
要不是因为你
And she'd still be alive

01:25.150 --> 01:26.770
她活得好好的
if it wasn't for you.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.420
这么说是为了复仇咯?
So it's revenge, eh, b?

01:28.610 --> 01:29.930
一报还一报
An eye for an eye?

01:29.940 --> 01:33.330
一旦做出决斗的决定 就不能收回来
Once you make such a declaration there's no going back.

01:34.230 --> 01:35.870
没什么好顾虑的了
There's nothing to go back to.

01:36.870 --> 01:38.060
很好
Good.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.890
那么就开始决斗吧
Then we have a fight.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.960
你们俩个马上去
Now, both of you,

01:44.970 --> 01:46.300
整理所属物品
go and assign your belongings,

01:46.310 --> 01:48.170
然后祈祷上苍站在你这边
and pray to whatever god is yours.

01:48.180 --> 01:50.590
15分钟后回来
Come back here in 15 minutes.

01:53.950 --> 01:58.680
斗 斗 斗
Fight, fight, fight, fight

01:58.690 --> 02:06.140
斗 斗 斗
fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight fight

02:37.520 --> 02:38.940
你还需要别的帮助吗?
You need anymore help?

02:39.060 --> 02:40.130
你帮的忙够多的了
You've done more than enough.

02:40.140 --> 02:41.610
老兄 接着这个
Here, take that, man.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.260
虽说钱不多 但足够你重新开始了
It's not a lot, but it's enough to get you started.

02:43.270 --> 02:44.550
不 不行 我不能接受这钱
Oh, no, no, I can't take this.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.600
我这么做是因为我想帮你们
I did this because I wanted to help you guys.

02:46.610 --> 02:49.200
去买辆车 买张大巴车票什么的
Hey, buy a car, get a bus ticket,

02:49.210 --> 02:50.850
随你怎样办 就是离开这就行
do whatever, just get out of here.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.030
多谢了
Thanks.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.450
我去加些油 行吗?
I'm going to get so gas, okay?

02:53.460 --> 02:54.380
我们在前头会合
I'll meet you in the front.

02:54.390 --> 02:55.590
好的
All right.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.530
好运
Good luck.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.600
同祝
You too.

03:06.550 --> 03:07.980
她和你一起去交换人质?
Is she coming with you to do the exchange?

03:07.990 --> 03:09.050
是的
Yeah.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.380
你觉得这样合适吗?
You think that's a good idea?

03:10.390 --> 03:11.860
我是说如果有什么麻烦的话
I mean, what if something goes wrong

03:11.870 --> 03:13.360
-她还会受伤呢 -我需要个保障
and she gets hurt? I need some incentive

03:13.370 --> 03:15.390
以防 惠斯勒 耍什么鬼把戏
just in case Whistler doesn't want to go quietly.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.490
你觉得这一切都能平稳度过?
You think any of this is going to go down quiet?

03:17.500 --> 03:18.600
就这样把LJ还给你了?
They're just going to give you LJ

03:18.610 --> 03:20.530
我怎么想的根本无关紧要
just like that? Doesn't matter what I think.

03:20.540 --> 03:22.350
我很清楚这帮子人会怎么干
I know what these people are capable of.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.270
我不会拿我儿子的命去赌博的
I'm not going to gamble with my son's life.

03:26.350 --> 03:27.760
或许你根本不需要什么赌博
Maybe you don't have to.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.400
阿历克斯
Alex.

03:31.530 --> 03:32.770
阿历克斯

15分钟后就到审判厅了
We'll be arriving at the courthouse in about 15 minutes.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.810
然后紧接着就开始听证会
Then the hearing will begin shortly.

03:40.940 --> 03:43.340
所有这一切马上就能了结了
All and all this whole thing will be done within the hour.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.720
很好
Good.

03:47.330 --> 03:48.790
听上去很不错
That sounds good.

03:54.450 --> 03:55.890
那么这场交易中
So with this deal

03:57.200 --> 04:00.460
他们到底想从我这获得什么呢?
what specifically are they expecting from me?

04:01.210 --> 04:02.940
他们需要知道所有这一切
They need to knoeverything.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.760
关于总统的 关于组织的事情
About the President, about the company.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.300
他们需要确认你手上有
They want to confirm that you have

04:07.310 --> 04:09.190
确凿的能证明他们犯罪的信息
viable incriminating information

04:09.200 --> 04:11.380
而且你还需要配合去做证
and that you can be a cooperative witness.

04:11.650 --> 04:13.300
如果我完全配合的话
If I cooperate fully

04:16.900 --> 04:18.890
我不会只起诉他们有罪
I won't just be incriminating them.

04:18.900 --> 04:22.010
你担心你会受到牵连
You're worried about all those skeletons in your closet,

04:22.020 --> 04:23.890
你有完全赦免权
but you have full immunity.

04:23.900 --> 04:24.610
所有这一切都会没事的
Everything will be fine.

04:24.620 --> 04:26.710
你只需要说出事实真相就行
All you have to do is tell the truth.

04:27.970 --> 04:29.350
保持冷静
Stay calm.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.910
最好活动下筋骨热热身
Better knuckle up.

04:57.310 --> 04:58.370
听着 我不知道你是怎么想的
Look, I don't know what you're thinking,

04:58.380 --> 04:58.950
但是杀了我
but killing me is not

04:58.960 --> 05:00.960
-于事无补 -别紧张
going to solve your problem. Relax.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.430
我不会杀你的
I'm not going to kill you.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.580
那刚才那幕又是为了什么?
Then what the hell was all that about?

05:03.590 --> 05:05.430
你如果想不被发现 从这里越狱出去
You want to make it out of here without being seen,

05:05.440 --> 05:08.190
你就需要转移视线 就像现在这样
you need a diversion. Now we have one.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.760
你昏头了 你不知道他们还在那边等着
You're off your head. Do you know that? They're waiting

05:09.770 --> 05:11.810
我们没时间争这个 快3点了
We don't have time for this. It's almost 3:00,

05:11.820 --> 05:14.120
意味着塔楼哨兵现在应该被迷药放倒了
and that means the tower guard should be drugged by now.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.670
3:13分时 阳光会照射在另一哨塔上
At 3:13, the sun's going to hit the other guard tower.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.360
有了所需的掩护 机不可失 时不再来
We'll have the cover we need. It's now or never.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.810
听着 迈克 我
Listen, Michael, I, uh

05:23.870 --> 05:26.320
刚才关于莎拉的话 不是那个意思
I meant what I said about Sara.

05:26.330 --> 05:28.430
换作我 就绝口不提那名字了
If I were you I wouldn'tention that name again.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.170
我们现在就出去 然后用你交换我侄子
We're getting out of here now, and then I'm trading you for my nephew.

05:31.180 --> 05:31.940
然后我会去查清楚
And then I'm going to find out

05:31.950 --> 05:34.450
真凶是谁的
who's responsible for taking her life

05:35.180 --> 05:36.760
然后血债血还
and I'm taking theirs.

07:56.930 --> 07:58.670

11:32.810 --> 11:34.070

11:34.080 --> 11:35.890

11:36.360 --> 11:37.110
没什么好担心的
It's nothing to worry about.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.170
一切都会顺利的

Nowhere to hide, malditos

外国佬
Gringos

17:10.700 --> 17:13.000
出来决斗了
Come out and play

17:13.300 --> 17:15.190
我们必须离开 这儿他们找不到
We've got to go. They can't find us here.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.090
但这个怎么处理?
But what about this?

17:16.100 --> 17:17.290
遮一下
Stash it

17:17.300 --> 17:18.500
但这个怎么处理?
Come on

17:21.000 --> 17:22.300
快啊
Come on

17:24.900 --> 17:26.500
走

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
臭小子 你要去哪里?
Where are you off to, Backra?

18:02.500 --> 18:04.000
你们俩去哪里了?
Where you boys been?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.700
洗手间?
The bathroom?

18:07.200 --> 18:07.790
这一切都是
This has all been

18:07.800 --> 18:09.600
一场巨大的误会
a terrible mistake.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.190
是吗?
Has it been?

18:11.200 --> 18:12.990
我们的问题都解决了
We've, uh, we've worked it out.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.900
没有必要再进行决斗了
There's no need to take this any further.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.790
显然你不太明白
You clearly don't understand

18:20.800 --> 18:22.790
我不能让你们的愚昧在这里肆虐
I can't have your foolishness spread in this place.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.990
我给过你这么多机会放弃决斗
I gave you every chance to pull out.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.300
求你了
Please.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.600
我们都知道规矩的
We know the rules

18:31.100 --> 18:32.190
两人决斗
Two men go in,

18:32.200 --> 18:33.800
一人活着出去
one man comes out

18:39.100 --> 18:39.990
现在
Now,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.900
决斗必须开始
this quarrel must be settled.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.500

Let's go.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.800
斗 斗 斗
Fight Fight Fight Fight Fight Fight

19:31.400 --> 19:33.400
你们两个绅士在等什么呢?
What are you gentlemen waiting for?

19:38.800 --> 19:41.400
你们不动手的话 我来帮忙
You two don't make this more interesting, I will.

19:47.300 --> 19:49.900
对不起了 如果只能有一个人活着
Sorry, mate if only one of us is getting out

20:06.600 --> 20:07.890
什么情况?
How's it look?

20:07.900 --> 20:09.700
LJ在货车后面
They got LJ in the back of the van.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.800
-他看起来还好吧? -我想是的
He seem all right to you? Yeah, I think so.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.690
好吧 他们有几个人?
All right, how many people they got?

20:13.700 --> 20:15.790
有个司机 有个保镖 就那么多
She's got a driver and a bodyguard that's it.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.690
很好 你观察一下四周
All right. You know I appreciate you hanging around, man

20:18.700 --> 20:21.000
兄弟 我们一起开始的行动
Hey, we started this together, bro.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.600
所以也一起来搞定
Let's finish it that way.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.900
快来吧 迈克
Come on, Michael.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.700
你在哪啊
Where are you?

21:30.600 --> 21:31.190
你在这干吗?
What you doing here?

21:31.200 --> 21:32.590
你应该在那里把风的
You're supposed to be keeping watch.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.500
只是确认下 看看是否一切正常
Just checking, making sure everything is all right.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.900
他们行动有点延迟 没什么
They're running a bit late, that's all.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.100
下一步呢?
So, what's the plan?

21:41.100 --> 21:45.000
游出去 等警察过去了 然后
You gonna swim out, wait for the police to pass, and

21:45.200 --> 21:46.900
在某个地方上船?
meet with a boat somewhere?

21:47.500 --> 21:48.800
差不多就是那样
Something like that.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.190
那再然后呢?
And then what?

21:52.200 --> 21:53.690
知道吗 你得回到
You know what, you need to get back

21:53.700 --> 21:55.400
-车那儿去 -不许动
to the car Don't move.

22:00.700 --> 22:01.890
让人吃惊啊
I'm impressed.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.290
拿着枪指着我
You've actually got the guts to look me in the eye

22:03.300 --> 22:04.700
还有勇气跟我对视
as you stab me in the back.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.490
你会怎么做 打死我?
What are you going to do, shoot me?

22:06.500 --> 22:08.590
别动 我不能眼看着你把詹姆斯
Don't. I can't let you hand over

22:08.600 --> 22:09.590
送到那些人手上
James to those people.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.690
你得考虑考虑你在干嘛
You need to think about what you're doing.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.100
我想过了
I have

22:12.100 --> 22:14.600
在你告诉我他们对莎拉做了什么之后
Every since you told me what they did to Sara.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
他们到了之后 詹姆斯和我就离开
When they get here, James and I, we're leaving.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.790
去哪?
Where to?

22:19.800 --> 22:22.700
我不知道 一个他们找不到的地方
I don't know. Somewhere they won't find us.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.890
那么这一段时间以来 你都在耍我
So, this whole time, you played me.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.290
就像你在耍我一样
Like you've been playing me.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.400
带我来这里 帮你把风?
Bringing me here to be your lookout?

22:29.600 --> 22:31.000
不过没什么
But it's okay.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.990
我们来这里都是
We were both here doing what we had to

22:33.000 --> 22:34.500
为了我们深爱的人做该做的事
for the people we love.

22:37.300 --> 22:40.400
你这么做的话 你也等于亲手杀了我儿子
You do this, you may as well be shooting my son yourself.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.600
对不起
I'm sorry.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.590
他们这个时候该出来了 有消息没?
They should be out by now. Any sign?

23:05.600 --> 23:06.690
一切都很安静
All quiet.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.300
你准备给他们多少时间?
How much longer do you want to give them?

23:12.200 --> 23:12.990
我知道你下半辈子
I know you wanted to live

23:13.000 --> 23:14.500
想住在海边
by an ocean your whole life.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.380
真可惜
Sad to think

23:15.390 --> 23:16.910
你只能葬身在海边了
the closest you'll get is being buried under one.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.290
你不会杀了我的
You're not gonna kill me.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.790
-是吗? -你需要我
Oh? You need me.

23:19.800 --> 23:20.890
你已经杀了莎拉
You already killed Sara.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.500
我要再有什么事的话
Anything happens to me,

23:23.100 --> 23:24.690
你手上就没有筹码了
you're out of bargaining chips.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.800
如果迈克今天不把惠斯勒救出来
If Michael doesn't get Whistler out today,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.800
我就不再需要什么筹码了
I won't need to bargain anymore.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.400
你们都要死
You'll all be dead.

23:51.700 --> 23:52.790
胡塔多?
Hurtdo?

23:52.800 --> 23:54.600
胡塔多? 你在哪?
Hurtdo?Where you at?

23:56.500 --> 23:57.890
呼叫 罗丹
Hey,Roldan.

23:57.900 --> 23:58.990
最好找人看看
Better send someone to check

23:59.000 --> 24:00.590
1号岗的胡塔多
on Hurtado in Tower One.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.890
呼叫他没反应
He is not answering his radio

24:01.900 --> 24:02.990
我这里也看不到他
and I don't have a visual.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.290
收到
Confirmed.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.900
我们会派人过去的
We'll send a couple men over.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.600
狠狠的踢他 斯科菲尔德
Kick him in the junk, Scofield

24:35.400 --> 24:38.290
你们在等什么? 这里没有平局的说法
What are you looking for, boy There are no draws here

24:38.300 --> 24:39.690
如果没有一个人来了结的话
If this isn't finished by one of you,

24:39.700 --> 24:41.800
我会下来了结你们两个
I'm coming down to finish both of you.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.000
胡塔多?
Hurtdo?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.190
你在干嘛?
What are you doing over there?

24:53.200 --> 24:55.100
什么 你居然当班的时候睡觉?
What, are you sleeping on the job?

24:55.600 --> 24:59.200
不 我不知道发生什么了
No, I don't know what happened.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.690
下手吧
End it.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.600
上帝啊 请原谅我
God God forgive me.

26:08.000 --> 26:08.990
他们这个时候该到了
They should have been here by now.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.100
或许他们已经出来了 正在赶来
Maybe they get out. They should be on their way.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.290
-他们失手了 -那我们现在该干嘛?
They didn't make it. So what do we do now?

26:14.300 --> 26:15.290
我管不着你怎么办
I don't care what you do,

26:15.300 --> 26:16.400
我要开着车子走
but I'm taking the car.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.700
什么?
What?

27:15.300 --> 27:17.000
发生什么事了?
What the hell's going on?

27:20.100 --> 27:21.600
把手放到头上
Put your hands up on your head

27:30.400 --> 27:33.100
你 下来 到这里来
You come down here.

27:33.900 --> 27:34.600
马上
Now

27:35.600 --> 27:38.700
我们要找出是谁干的
We are going to find out who is behind this.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.100
什么事?
What?

27:48.100 --> 27:50.200
你是不是该告诉我发生什么了?
Were you going to let me know what the hell's going on?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
林肯?
Lincoln?

27:53.100 --> 27:53.900
我在听
I'm here.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.400
很好 他们在哪?
Good. Where are they?

27:58.500 --> 27:59.900
他们在我车上
They're in the car with me.

27:59.900 --> 28:00.690
我听到警报声了
I heard the alarm.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.990
警报前他们就跑得很远了
They were long gone before that thing went off.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.390
好吧 如果他们开了个好头
Well, if they had such a head start,

28:04.400 --> 28:05.690
你干嘛要磨蹭这么久?
why are you so far behind?

28:05.700 --> 28:07.990
听着 你想让我开车的时候和你说话?
Listen, do you want me to talk to your drive?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.500
让惠斯勒听电话
I want you to put Whistler on the phone.

28:10.700 --> 28:11.700
什么?
What?

28:11.700 --> 28:12.800
让他听电话
Put him on.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.190
他在后备箱里
He's in the trunk.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.790
不过 如果你强烈要求的话
But, if you feel that strongly about it,

28:17.800 --> 28:19.990
我可以把他拖出来 你们俩可以稍微聊聊
I can pull over and you two can have a Nice little talk.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.090
如果运气好的话 或许会有警察过来
If we're real lucky, maybe some cops will swing by.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.290
我肯定警察也想和他谈谈的
I'm sure they'd like a word, too.

28:23.300 --> 28:26.700
知道吗? 准备好放LJ
You know what? Just get LJ ready.

28:31.400 --> 28:35.900
有人要逃出去 并且袭击了我的人
Whoever tried to escape assaulted one of my men.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.490
众所周知 任何对巴拿马士兵
And, as you know, any attempt on the life

28:40.500 --> 28:42.200
构成生命威胁的袭击
of a Panamanian soldier

28:43.300 --> 28:45.500
都是死刑
warrants the death penalty.

28:45.700 --> 28:48.400
是212号囚室的人干的
This attempt was made from cell #212.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.890
如果没记错的话
And if memory serves,

28:49.900 --> 28:54.500
那个囚室是你的人 对吧?
that cell belongs to members of your crew, no?

29:09.700 --> 29:10.800
你
You.

29:14.700 --> 29:16.600
你是那个送奶人吧
You are one of the Milkman's boys.

29:18.600 --> 29:19.600
那是你的囚室吧?
Is it your cell?

29:40.200 --> 29:42.700
我认为这是个肯定的答案
I'm going to take that as a yes.

29:46.300 --> 29:49.700
我一直认为我们是亲密伙伴 你和我
I thought we were compadres, you and I.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.390
我让你做你的生意 招你的妓
I let you run your business, have your whores.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.890
没有水的时候
When you asked me for your own personal supply of water

29:54.900 --> 29:57.590
还有停电的时候 我都满足你了吧?
when the lumbing went down, did I not provide it?

29:57.600 --> 29:58.290
你让我切断电话
When you asked me to get rid

29:58.300 --> 30:00.190
使他们无从非法运毒进来
of the phones, make them contraband,

30:00.200 --> 30:02.900
以此来控制这里的交易
so you could control the trade in here,

30:03.100 --> 30:05.400
我难道没满足你么?
did I not comply?

30:06.500 --> 30:07.900
我做这一切都是为了你
I do all this for you.

30:07.900 --> 30:10.990
而作为交易条件 我只要你为我
And in exchange, you were to do one thing

30:11.000 --> 30:12.200
做一件事
for me.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.300
管好这些人
Keep these men in line

30:25.000 --> 30:27.300
也许我们看错人了
Maybe we just backed the wrong horse.

30:28.200 --> 30:32.800
也许别人更适合这份工作
Perhaps there is another in here better suited for the job.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.400
祝你好运 兄弟
Good luck, Bredda.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.490
你知道我们中没人想
You know none of us tried

31:09.500 --> 31:11.300
从那间牢房越狱
to break out of that cell.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.800
我知道
I do.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.990
但你一定知道只有一个人
Then you must know there's only one guy here

31:15.000 --> 31:16.700
会愚蠢到想去试试
foolish enough to try.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.900
很高兴看到你恢复如初
Nice to see you back in form.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.400
谢谢
Thanks.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.600
苏林斯 那有什么新消息吗?
Any news from Sullins?

31:36.600 --> 31:37.800
他正在处理此事
He's working on it.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.400
别人说什么都没关系
It doesn't matter what people say.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.700
他们怎么说?
What do they say?

31:46.900 --> 31:50.700
-你知道他们怎么说吗 -怎么说?
You know people, how they talk. About?

31:50.800 --> 31:53.300
他们说是你杀了那些人
The men, the ones they say you killed.

31:54.800 --> 31:55.700
这是真的吗?
Is it true?

31:57.700 --> 31:59.900
如果是真的 你可以和我说说
Because, if it is, you can talk to about it.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.600
真是这样吗?
Is that a fact?

32:13.800 --> 32:15.190
是的 你可以相信我
Yes. You can trust me.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.190
这么明说了吧
So let me get this straight.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.100
苏林斯 让你来扮白脸?
Sullins sends you to be good cop?

32:19.000 --> 32:19.890
不是这样的
That's not what this is.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.490
其实从来就没有什么交易 对吗?
There never was a deal, was there?

32:21.500 --> 32:22.890
苏林斯 只是想让我认罪
Sullins just wants me to confess

32:22.900 --> 32:25.490
那他就有更多的指控理由遣送我回美国
so hcan bring me up on more charges back in the States.

32:25.500 --> 32:26.590
交易很合理
The deal is legit.

32:26.600 --> 32:27.490
那听证会本应该是
The hearing was supposed to be

32:27.500 --> 32:29.390
我们离开监狱一小时后开的
an hour after we left the prison,

32:29.400 --> 32:31.390
而我还在等
and I'm still waiting.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.390
为什么你不把一切告诉我 费丽舍?
So why don't you just come clean, Felicia, huh?

32:33.400 --> 32:35.500
看在以前的交情份上 怎样?
For old times' sake? How about it?

32:37.700 --> 32:40.200
那你怎么不看在老交情份上配合呢?
How about you do me the same courtesy, Alex?

32:40.500 --> 32:42.590
我不傻 我弟弟只是你们利用的工具
I'm not blind. My brother was a user.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.090
我早就知道了
I can smell the stuff a mile away.

32:44.100 --> 32:46.800
你不是想说我隐瞒什么吧?
Don't you accuse me of being the one who's hiding something.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.600
我刚从广播中证实了
Hey, I just got confirmation from the radio.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.990
狱警盘点过 监狱周围也被监控起来
The guards took a head count and they secured the perimeter.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.300

看起来他们正准备离开
Looks like they're packing up.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.290
不论你做什么
Whatever you do

33:15.300 --> 33:17.300
不要让他们带走LJ 好吗?

你对儿子许下一个实现不了的诺言吗?

35:09.700 --> 35:10.590
闭嘴
Watch your mouth.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.400
我告诉你一个小秘密
I'll let you in on a little secret.

35:13.200 --> 35:13.690
自从你选择
When you choose

35:13.700 --> 35:16.190
这么解决问题 你就该知道
this line of work, you know it's all going to come down

35:16.200 --> 35:17.600
会发生现在这一幕
to a moment like this.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.100
做什么?
To do what?

35:56.200 --> 35:57.390
让我查出究竟索纳监狱里发生了什么事情
Let me find out what happened in Sona.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.800
让我和迈克谈谈
Let me talk to Michael.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.890

36:02.500 --> 36:03.900

36:37.900 --> 36:39.200
苏克雷

36:40.300 --> 36:40.990
你怎么样?
You all right?

37:10.500 --> 37:12.900
如你所知
Right, just so you know,

37:13.000 --> 37:14.090
我没能逃出去
I wouldn't have gone through with it.

37:14.100 --> 37:16.400
如果幸运的话 我们不会被发现
Lucky for us, we'll never have to find out.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.600
那现在我们怎么做?
So what do we do now?

37:23.100 --> 37:24.600
你知道你在哪里么 小子
You know where are you, boy?

37:25.300 --> 37:26.990
我不是医生 但我可以猜猜看
Well, I'm no doctor, You but I'm just guessingboy.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.700
你妈一定是有天晚上喝多了才
your mother had a little bit too much to drink one night

37:30.300 --> 37:31.400
继续说呀
Keep talking

37:31.500 --> 37:33.000
下一个就轮到你了
and you're going to be next.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.500
你选个死法吧 老兄?
How you want it, brother?

37:51.900 --> 37:54.000
快的还是慢的
Fast or slow?

37:54.500 --> 37:58.200
我稍后会亲自动手
I think I later handle this one myself.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.300
你有孩子么 斯科菲尔德先生?
Do you have children, Mr. Scofield?

38:14.200 --> 38:15.400
会有的
Maybe someday.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.400
会有个非常乐观的家伙步你后尘
That's very optimistic for a man in your position.

38:18.700 --> 38:20.300
我有五个孩子
Myself, I have five.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.300
三个小子 两个丫头
Three boys, two girls.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.500
我常常给他们讲的一个故事
Now I used to tell them a story

38:24.900 --> 38:26.090
我想在你们国家里
I believe in your country

38:26.100 --> 38:28.500
他们管它叫"狼来了"
they call it,"The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

38:28.500 --> 38:29.600
你知道那个故事么?
You know it?

38:29.700 --> 38:31.690
你知道这个故事的寓意
Well, then you know the moral of that story

38:31.700 --> 38:33.690
即使撒谎者说的是实话
is even when liars tell the truth,

38:33.700 --> 38:35.400
他们也是不可信的
they can never be believed.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.600
你命悬一线 小子
But your life's on the line, boy.

38:39.700 --> 38:42.500
你想越狱么 斯科菲尔德先生?
Are you trying to break out of this prison, Mr. Scofield?

38:45.100 --> 38:46.500
不想
No.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.490
你真准备越狱么?
Are you trying to break out of this prison?

38:51.500 --> 38:52.790
我们都知道这是不可能的
We both know that's not possible.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.190
-回答我 -你想让我说什么?
Answer me What do you want me to say?

38:54.200 --> 38:56.290
我想让你告诉我事实 我要听实话
I want you to tell me the truth. I want to hear it.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.400
-你想找个理由干掉我 -不是 小子

38:59.100 --> 39:00.500
我已经有一个很好的理由干掉你了
I have good reason to kill you.

39:00.700 --> 39:01.990
因为你 我已经不可能
Because of you, it's no longer possible

39:02.000 --> 39:03.990
有力地管理这个监狱
for me to effectively govern this prison.

39:04.000 --> 39:04.890
不管是否承认
Justified or not,

39:04.900 --> 39:06.700
人们已经不服我了
the men no longer have faith in me.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.490
我只能做一件事
That leaves only one thing for me to do

39:08.500 --> 39:10.000
来保命
to guarantee my survival.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.600
你可以着手越狱 斯科菲尔德先生
You are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.200
你要带上我
And you're taking me with you.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.190
我得到一些好消息
Well, I've got some good news

39:56.200 --> 39:58.700
还有些更好的消息
and I've got some better news.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.200
让我们从好消息开始
Let's start with the good.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.500
巴拿马人方面已经做出让步
Panamanians are back on board.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.600
更好的消息呢?
And the better news?

40:06.800 --> 40:07.790
你可以在

40:07.800 --> 40:09.300
这张床上好好睡上一觉了
a really Nice sleep on that bed.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.700
我还以为
I thought that I

40:12.600 --> 40:14.990
我会听到可以乘飞机回美国的消息
After the hearing I was going to be on a plane back to the U.S.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.590
你说过
You said

40:16.600 --> 40:17.890
我是说过 你会回去的
I did, and you will be,

40:17.900 --> 40:19.890
但是现在开听证会太晚了
but it's just too late to do the hearing now.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.890
那是我们明早要做的第一件事情
We'll get to it first thing tomorrow.

40:21.900 --> 40:24.300
-明早? -听起来不错
Tomorrow morning? Sounds about right.

40:27.900 --> 40:30.690
拜托 可有什么方式方法
Please is there something, is there anything

40:30.700 --> 40:32.690
能让事情进展顺利的吗?
that we can do to help speed things up?

40:32.700 --> 40:34.490
当精灵满足了你的愿望
When a genie grants you a wish

40:34.500 --> 40:35.990
你不会还摧他立马兑现吧
you don't really tell him to make it snappy.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.190
这个听证会
This hearing

40:37.200 --> 40:38.800

你真的难以置信
You know, you are unbelievable.

40:45.100 --> 40:47.390
我进了全力
I have dropped everything

40:47.400 --> 40:48.390
才同意她
to come down her

40:48.400 --> 40:49.790
把你拉出火坑
and drag your sorry ass

40:49.800 --> 40:50.790
你不懂么
out of that hellhole You don't understand.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.900
-我们已经说好了 -我等不及了
I've made you a deal. I can't I can't wait.

40:56.300 --> 40:57.500
我等不及了
I can't wait.

40:57.700 --> 40:58.790
你知道 我很高兴
You know, I am so glad

40:58.800 --> 41:00.490
促成此行
I have made this trip

41:00.500 --> 41:02.790
来帮助你敬仰的同事
to help your esteemed colleague.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.300
我真可笑
I am just tickled.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.500
把他铐起来
Cuff him.

41:07.800 --> 41:08.390
有必要么?
Is that necessary?

41:08.400 --> 41:10.200
把他铐起来
Cuff him.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.300
对不起
I'm sorry.

41:20.100 --> 41:21.100
我不能再等了
I can't wait.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.790
看见惠斯勒了吗?
Hey, have you seen Whistler?

41:32.800 --> 41:33.700
没看见
No.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.190
我尽心尽力工作
I spent my whole career

41:36.200 --> 41:38.700
想方设法把坏人关在牢里
trying to keep bad people behind bars.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.490
似乎通过我的工作
Like somehow by doing my job

41:40.500 --> 41:42.800
我能让世界变得更美好
I was making the world a better place.

41:44.800 --> 41:45.700
接着呢
And then

41:45.800 --> 41:48.600
就发生了像莎拉这样的事
then you hear about what happened to someone like Sara.

41:49.900 --> 41:51.690
现在看起来好像外面的坏人
Damn if it doesn't seem like there's more bad people

41:51.700 --> 41:53.600
比这里还要多
out there than in here.

41:59.800 --> 42:02.600
我警告过兄弟俩 如果他们失败了会怎样
I warned the brothers what would happen if they failed.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.890
如果我现在给他们更多的时间
If I give them more time now, I may as well hand them

42:04.900 --> 42:07.300
不如给他们一并捎上香烟和避孕套
a condom and a cigarette to go with it.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.290
我大老远的来这儿
You know, I came all the way down here.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.590
你最起码应该给我点儿意见
The least you could do is offer me an opinion.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.600
我以为我们说好了你不会来这儿
I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.000
我以为你会在7天之内出来
And I thought you needed to be out in seven days.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.700
我想知道这次耽搁会如何影响大局
I need to know how this delay is going to affect things.

42:23.900 --> 42:27.390
那不会好过 但是还有希望
Well, it won't be comfortable, but it will be possible.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.390
谢谢你 詹姆斯
Oh, well, thank you, James,

42:28.400 --> 42:31.390
但是那不会毁了我的信心
but that doesn't exactly ravage me with confidence.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.490
那什么会?
And what would?

42:32.500 --> 42:34.000
你坐上飞机逃之夭夭
Your ass on a plane.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.200
再给我4天
Four more days.

42:36.400 --> 42:40.500
如果我出去了 我还可以做到
If I'm out of here by then, I can still do it.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.800
相信我 不会有事儿的
Trust me. It'll be fine.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.400
我会告诉他们的
I'll let the brothers know.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.800
格瑞成
Gretchen.

42:55.900 --> 42:57.200
索菲亚呢
About Sofia

42:58.900 --> 43:00.000
她很好
She's fine.

43:00.700 --> 43:03.300
布鲁斯对她非常之好
Burrows is taking real good care of her.

43:03.700 --> 43:05.200
好运 詹姆斯
Good luck, James.
