我并不是你想象的那种人
I'm not the man you think I am.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.230
是啊  但我确实知道你是什么样的人  迈克尔
Yeah, well, I have a pretty good idea who you are, Michael.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.660
如果你知道的话
If that's true,

11:22.670 --> 11:24.890
你就应该明白  我根本不想去福克斯河监狱
then you already know I never wanted to be in fox river.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.730
也没有想到会遇见你  亨利
I never wanted to meet you, Henry.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.630
我更没有想过去毁掉你的生活
I certainly didn't want to ruin your life.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.630
对  很好  你做得很棒
Yeah.Well, you've done a pretty damn good job.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.230
- 请你不要和他说这些  - 我的话还没讲完
- You're not saying anything to him - I haven't said myself,

11:33.240 --> 11:35.460
亨利  我也一直在调查这些事
Henry.I've looked into this.

11:35.470 --> 11:36.830
他说的都是千真万确的
What he's saying to you is absolutely true.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.630
我只是想挽救哥哥的性命
I just want my brother's life back.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.260
并且让人们知道真相
I want people to know the truth.

11:40.270 --> 11:41.690
我会不惜一切代价
I'd give anything for that.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.260
甚至是我的生命
I'd lay down my life.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.730
是啊  你站在枪的那一边
Well, that's easy for you to say,

11:44.740 --> 11:46.800
当然可以这么说
standing on that side of the gun.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.200
那么这样又如何
What if I'm standing on this side?

11:58.700 --> 12:00.990
你可以到别的地方去问问
There are places that can better serve your needs.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.390
我知道我的权利
Look, I know my rights, okay?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.660
这里不是基础护理站
This isn't a primary care facility.

12:04.670 --> 12:05.930
我们是对有生命危险状况
We provide necessary care

12:05.940 --> 12:07.090
提供必要的治疗
in life-threatening situations.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.160
我知道你想说什么了
Look, I know what this is

12:08.170 --> 12:10.460
你们要等到她危在旦夕了再来伸出援助之手?
are you going to wait until she's dead before you give her some help?

12:10.470 --> 12:11.630
这就是你想告诉我的?!
Is that what you're telling me?!

12:11.640 --> 12:13.130
我不想为这事和你争吵
I'm not going to argue with you, sir.

12:13.140 --> 12:15.630
这里是医院  不是避难所
This is a hospital, not a homeless shelter.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.340
你说什么?
A what?

12:19.440 --> 12:21.940
你刚才和我说什么?
What did you just say to me?

12:23.740 --> 12:26.240
我真不敢相信你们是这样的人
I can't believe you people.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.230
我们走
Come on.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.830
这儿人太多了 我们走吧
The line is a little bit too long, okay?

12:30.840 --> 12:34.300
我们去别的地方
We'll go somewhere else.

12:35.370 --> 12:38.090
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

12:38.100 --> 12:41.100
我们去找其他医生  宝贝
We got to find another doctor, sweetie.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.530
我的天
Oh, my god.

12:44.540 --> 12:46.800
我们走
Let's go.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.770
闪开!
Move!

12:57.170 --> 12:59.640
快  宝贝!
Come on, baby.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.140
富兰克林!
Franklin!

13:12.840 --> 13:15.540
都闪开!
Move out of the way!

13:17.840 --> 13:19.060
FBI! 站住!
FBI! Stop!

13:19.070 --> 13:21.540
站住!
Stop!

13:25.740 --> 13:27.670
好吧
Okay.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.460
宝贝  放开我好吗?  你下来
Just one second, baby. Baby, you got to get down, okay?

13:30.470 --> 13:31.830
别这样  宝贝
No, no, sweetie, you got to get dowN.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.060
好孩子  放开他
You got to let him go, honey.

13:33.070 --> 13:34.190
下来
Get down.Get down.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.560
好孩子  你要放开他
Honey, you got to let him go.

13:35.570 --> 13:37.400
不
No.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.560
她不肯放开我
Man, she's not letting go.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.870
别让她为你犯的错 付出代价
Don't let her pay for your mistakes.

13:43.970 --> 13:46.340
你明白我的意思吗?
you hear me?

13:58.740 --> 14:02.860
现在向你开枪  我不会有一丝犹豫
I could shoot you right now and not even think twice.

14:02.870 --> 14:03.960
但你做不到
But you won't.

14:03.970 --> 14:08.160
你在监狱部门那么多年 不能这样轻易抛开你的人生
You spent too much time around prisons to throw your life away like that.

14:08.170 --> 14:10.090
你到底想怎么样?
What the hell are you trying to pull?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.390
很简单-- 这把钥匙
It's simple--that's the key

14:11.400 --> 14:13.230
能让一个无罪的人 得到自由
to an innocent man's freedom.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.430
求你了  亨利
Come on, Henry.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.330
我们都知道发生了什么
We both know there's something going on here.

14:16.340 --> 14:18.390
许多人为此而送命
Too many people have died.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.260
看着我的眼睛  你会明白此刻我没有丝毫的掩饰
Look me in the eye, tell me you don't believe there's a cover-up going on right now.

14:22.270 --> 14:25.790
我没有义务这么做  迈克尔
I've got no moral obligations here, Michael.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.760
据我所知 林肯罪不可恕
As far as I know, Lincoln is as guilty as hell.

14:29.770 --> 14:32.290
那我们一起去查个究竟
Then take a ten-minute drive with me,and we'll find out.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.130
我就这一个请求
That's all I ask.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.830
亨利  你是知道的
Henry, you've looked into this before.You've thought about it.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.160
是的
I have.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.830
我很清楚一点
And I've come to one conclusion--

14:42.840 --> 14:46.200
我和此事无关
this has nothing to do with me.

14:46.370 --> 14:47.990
我懂得法律
but I am a man of the law,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.760
而且我有必要告发
and right now,I've got a convicted felon

14:49.770 --> 14:52.440
这个就站在我家的重犯
standing inside my house

14:52.970 --> 14:54.560
也许我能和你做笔交易
Well, maybe there's something I can offer you

14:54.570 --> 14:57.600
来改变你的想法
to make you change your mind.

16:31.070 --> 16:34.300

What do you intend to do with us?

16:35.270 --> 16:37.390

You grease monkey.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.360
你都不配拿最低工资

我他妈又不在墓地工作

没有谁配拿到多于每小时一美元的钱
There ain't no man deserve more pennies on a dollar per hour

16:44.270 --> 16:46.930
因为那比他们的智商指数还高
than they got iq points in their head.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.530
我又不傻
I ain't stupid.

16:48.540 --> 16:53.170

18:14.070 --> 18:16.830

因为我觉得自己就像一只马戏团的猴子一样
'Cause I feel like a circus freak.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.990
这样...
Well...

18:27.000 --> 18:29.430
现在...

你要以它为最大的兴趣

为根本不是我做的事  而把我送上电椅

你可真是心甘情愿
You were willing to do that.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.890

好 不管你怎么看

我是巴格威尔家族的最后一代

28:09.800 --> 28:12.960
不过也正因如此
And yet,

28:12.970 --> 28:15.390
我有了巨大的希望
there's something in that that gives me great hope.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.660
再也不会有叫巴格威尔的人 在这世上闲逛了
No more Bagwells shall roam this planet.

28:17.670 --> 28:19.930
流淌在他们血脉中的卑劣品性 也将不复存在
Not with that vile blood in their veins.

28:19.940 --> 28:21.060
我想做的就是
All I want to do is

28:21.070 --> 28:23.990
断绝这个血脉  毁灭它
end the bloodline,extirpate it,

28:24.000 --> 28:27.090
然后重新开始
and start another,a fresh.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.630
一个新的家族
A new family.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.930
哦 泰迪

28:29.940 --> 28:32.130
这些孩子是我的救星

28:32.140 --> 28:36.570

28:45.100 --> 28:47.090
我会参加教会
I will take communion,

28:47.100 --> 28:50.430
在圣光的照耀下  接受洗礼
be baptized under a truer light.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.760
我唯一的请求
All I ask is

28:51.770 --> 28:54.460
就是要你重新爱我
that you love me back,

28:54.470 --> 28:57.730
只要一点点
just a little.

28:57.740 --> 29:00.890
或者慢慢的学会这么做

29:00.900 --> 29:05.140
你能做到吗 苏珊

31:24.370 --> 31:26.490

她患有肾病...多囊肾

31:30.440 --> 31:32.790
以前我们都能把她的病情控制住
Normally, we have it under control,

31:32.800 --> 31:33.960

32:23.770 --> 32:25.330

32:42.140 --> 32:44.130

32:44.140 --> 32:45.530

32:47.970 --> 32:49.890

看上去  结束工作后
Looks like the lifestyle's treating you well.

33:02.040 --> 33:02.560
你过的还挺自在
Yeah?

33:02.570 --> 33:04.970
喝着白兰地酒  抽着古巴雪茄?
Socializing over cubans and cognac?

33:05.840 --> 33:10.600
但事实并非如此  是吧?
But that's not what you were doing, is it?

33:11.170 --> 33:13.390
亨利
Henry.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.660
你不介意让我看一下你的口袋吧?
You don't mind if ask you to empty your pockets?

33:16.670 --> 33:18.090
但事实上我介意
As a matter of fact, I do.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.600
我不想和你玩游戏
I'm not going to play any games with you.

33:21.900 --> 33:25.230
我们都很明白你为什么会到这儿来
We both know why you came here today.

33:25.240 --> 33:30.700
年青人  我希望你能把路让开
I suggest you get out of my way, young man.

33:31.200 --> 33:34.900
不可以
I can't do that.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.460
除非你希望
Unless you'd like to

33:39.470 --> 33:42.870
你和你的家人都有麻烦
cause serious trouble for yourself and your family,

33:42.880 --> 33:47.000
我建议你应该把你找到的东西交给我
I advise you to hand over whatever it is you found.

33:47.700 --> 33:50.740
快
Now.

33:52.270 --> 33:54.200
迈克尔

别紧张  没事了
Easy, easy, it's okay, it's okay.

35:15.640 --> 35:18.270
太太  你还好吗?
Ma'am, are you all right?

35:18.340 --> 35:20.690
你们怎么会来
I don't understand.

35:20.700 --> 35:22.260
我们接到了电话
We got a call.

35:22.270 --> 35:24.460
有人说这里有人质
Someone said there's a hostage situation here.

35:24.470 --> 35:29.070
没人知道我们在这儿
No one knew we were here.

35:49.340 --> 35:50.960
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

35:50.970 --> 35:53.360
好了
Okay.

35:53.370 --> 35:55.160
结果如何?
Hey, so what's going on?

35:55.170 --> 35:58.060
恐怕你的女儿出现了肾衰竭的迹象
I'm afraid your daughter shows signs of renal failure.

35:58.070 --> 36:00.930
她以前做过血液透析吗?
She ever had hemodialysis?

36:00.940 --> 36:03.830
没...  没有
No, hemo... no.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.840
不会到这种地步吧
No, this has never really gone that far.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.260
什么  你打算就在这里做吗?
What, are you planning on doing it right here?

36:11.270 --> 36:13.660
我们没有相关设施
Were not set up for it.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.330
她也没有准备
And neither is she.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.830
但是不远的几条街区外
But there is a county

36:16.840 --> 36:19.290
有一家郡级透析中心
dialysis clinic a few blocks away.

36:19.300 --> 36:21.730
我现在要在她的颈部插入导管
But we're gonna have to place a catheter in her neck

36:21.740 --> 36:25.930
以便她接受进一步诊断
so she can be examined.

36:25.940 --> 36:29.430
忍着点  宝贝  可能会有一点凉
Hold on, sweetie, this is gonna be a little cold.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.540
没事的  孩子
It's okay, baby.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.130
等一下  等一下
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. Wait,

36:40.140 --> 36:41.430
这是什么?
what, what is that?

36:41.440 --> 36:42.630
套管针
It's a trocar.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.460
是插导管用的
It's used for placing the catheter.

36:44.470 --> 36:47.800
宝贝  躺下
I got her.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.930
真的有必要这样么?
Do we really have to go this far?

36:53.940 --> 36:56.130
听我说
Look.

36:56.140 --> 36:58.230
我现在尽我所能做到最好
I'm doing the best I can here,

36:58.240 --> 36:59.590
还有你要明白的是
but you got to understand something.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.230
你的女儿现在病了
Your daughter is sick.

37:01.240 --> 37:04.700
也许这手段看上去很严重  但情况就是如此
Now, this may look like a desperate measure because it is.

37:09.470 --> 37:13.060
可能会有一点疼
This is gonna hurt a little bit.

37:13.070 --> 37:13.930
住手!
Stop!

37:13.940 --> 37:15.930
住手
Stop.

37:15.940 --> 37:17.760
过来  孩子
Come on, baby.

37:17.770 --> 37:19.590
我们走了
Come with me.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.170
我做不到
I can't do this.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.830
怎么了?
What's going on?

37:41.840 --> 37:46.600
我和波普做了一个交易

38:03.800 --> 38:05.530
你知道这事?

38:05.540 --> 38:07.630

I wouldn't count on the courts
