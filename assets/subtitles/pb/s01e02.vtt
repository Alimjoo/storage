WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:08.200
本庭在此判你服刑 斯科菲尔德先生
I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell.

00:08.210 --> 00:10.580
你为什么这么急着要见布伦斯?
Why do you want to see Burrows

00:10.590 --> 00:11.830
因为他是我哥哥
Because he's my brother.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.790
所以你就来这里陪他?
So you get yourself tossed into Fox River with him?

00:14.800 --> 00:17.090
为了什么... 救他么?
To what? Save him?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.500
不管陷害我的是谁
And whoever it was that set me up wants me

00:18.510 --> 00:20.300
都是想尽快将我除掉
in the ground as quickly as possible.

00:20.310 --> 00:21.670
听着 日子越接近
Look,the closer it gets,

00:21.680 --> 00:24.760
我就越担心事情会被抖出来
the more I'm worried that the bottom will fall out of this whole thing.

00:24.770 --> 00:26.850
这就是那个指控阿布鲁奇的混蛋
That son of a bitch fingered Abruzzi.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.390
有人发现了菲波纳奇
Someone found Fibonacci.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.020
是谁
Who was this someone?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.470
为什么要雇他
Why'd you hire him?

00:31.480 --> 00:34.980
靠近你的朋友 更加靠近你的敌人
Keep your friends close,and your enemies closer.

00:34.990 --> 00:36.650
约翰 你动我试试看
Hey, come at me, John

00:36.660 --> 00:37.770
我你孙子跪地求饶
I'm coming after you.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.780
我不信
I doubt it.

00:41.330 --> 00:42.740
我要把你弄出去
I'm getting you out of here.

00:42.750 --> 00:43.530
不可能
It's impossible.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.320
除非这地方是你自己设计的
Not if you designed the place it isn't.

00:45.330 --> 00:46.490
你看过蓝图了
You've seen the blueprints.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.830
远不止如此
Better than that.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.210
我已经纹在身上了
I've got 'em on me.

01:05.350 --> 01:09.350
你的眼光总是放的很远
You're anticipating every one of my moves three moves in advance.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.850
简直是个战略家
You're a hell of a strategist, fish.

01:11.860 --> 01:13.270
想过回波士顿么
You ever think about Boston?

01:13.280 --> 01:14.180
当然
Sure.

01:14.190 --> 01:15.980
想再去看看么
Think you'll ever see it again?

01:15.990 --> 01:19.560
我已经60岁的老头了 还有60年的刑期
I'm a 60-year-old man with 60 years left on my ticket.

01:19.570 --> 01:21.150
你是怎么想的?
What do you think?

01:21.160 --> 01:23.150
我就打算走出去
I'm thinking about going.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.820
偷偷摸摸的还是大摇大摆的
Well, there's going and there's going.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.780
你指哪个呢
Which one do you mean?

01:27.790 --> 01:30.580
你心里面认为的哪个
The one you think I mean.

01:33.170 --> 01:38.250
怎么有你这样的 刚进来三天就想开溜了
Three days inside and he's already thinking about turning rabbit.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.750
你会习惯的
It'll pass.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.180
刚来的都这样
It always does.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.130
现在有更重要的事值得关注
Got bigger things to worry about at the moment.

01:45.140 --> 01:48.090
经验告诉我将有大事发生
I've been in here long enough to know it when I see it.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.640
暴风雨前的宁静
The calm before the storm.

01:50.650 --> 01:54.390
黑人和白人即将开战了
Whites and blacks are going at each other real soon here.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.020
人人选择自己的归属 然后便是血流成河
Everybody chooses sides and a lot of guys bleed.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.560
为什么呢
There a reason?

01:59.570 --> 02:02.770
就像不能把猫和狗关在一起
Same reason you don't put cats and dogs in the same cage.

02:02.780 --> 02:05.200
他们是天生的死对头
They don't get along.

02:33.770 --> 02:34.770
嗯
Hm.

02:34.780 --> 02:35.560
怎么了
What?

02:35.570 --> 02:37.140
马桶冲不了水了
Toilet won't flush.

02:37.150 --> 02:38.480
那么
So?

02:38.490 --> 02:41.530
只有一种可能
Means only one thing, fish.

02:45.620 --> 02:48.110
这样你就无法冲走违禁品
You can't flush your contraband.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.950
我们没什么可担心的
We got nothing to worry about.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.290
那只是你
Says who?

02:55.920 --> 02:58.090
桌子下面
Under the table

03:01.760 --> 03:03.380
这是什么玩意儿
What the hell is this?

03:03.390 --> 03:06.970
防身用的 赶快把它藏起来
It's insurance, white boy. Now dump it.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.600
把门打开
Open it.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.600
这样看来
So,

03:16.610 --> 03:20.020
用来充当种族骚动的武器么
tooling up for the race riot, are we?

03:20.030 --> 03:22.320
把它交给我
Hand it over.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.780
黑白之战
Huh. Rughead and the Billy.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.400
那么你站在哪一边呢 小嫩鸡
Which side are you on, anyhow, fish?

03:30.410 --> 03:31.950
都不是 长官
That would be neither, boss.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.280
或许你会在户外活动时带上它
Maybe you're gonna go extracurricular with it, then.

03:34.290 --> 03:36.840
用它来伤害狱警也说不定
Stick a CO, maybe.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.540
有什么问题么 副警长
Is there a problem here, deputy?

03:38.550 --> 03:40.800
找到一把匕首
Got a shank in here.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.220
是你的么
Is this yours?

03:53.060 --> 03:55.310
看你也不像是说谎的
You're not a good liar.

03:55.690 --> 03:58.270
苏克雷 去禁闭室
Come on, Sucre. You're going to the SHU.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.360
去别的地方看看 副警长
Move along.Deputy

04:06.370 --> 04:08.070
这间牢房的事情还没处理完呢
I'm not done shaking this cell down yet.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.290
我说让你去别的地方看看
I said move along.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.200
有老头子为你撑腰啊
In the old man's back pocket, are you?

04:16.210 --> 04:17.910
我告诉你 小嫩鸡
Well, I got news for you, fish.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.080
白天这里也许他说了算
He may run this place during the day,

04:20.090 --> 04:23.260
但是晚上却由我管
but I run it during the night.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.990
迈克尔 和我说说你的计划
What the hell were you thinking, Michael?

05:08.740 --> 05:10.650
我们怎么出去?
How are we doing it?

05:10.660 --> 05:12.450
医务室
The infirmary.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.370
医务室
Infirmary.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.490
那里是保安系统的最薄弱环节
It's the weakest link in the security chain.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.200
一旦我拿到 方纳克
If I get that PUGNAC,

05:19.210 --> 05:20.870
我就能得到所有的一切
I'll get all the access I need.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.210
方纳克 是什么东西
What the hell's a PUGNAC?

05:22.220 --> 05:25.130
降低我的胰岛素指标 看上去就像得了糖尿病
It lowers my insulin levels to the point that I'm hyperglycemic.

05:25.140 --> 05:27.630
只要医生认为我患有糖尿病
As long as the good doctor thinks I'm diabetic,

05:27.640 --> 05:30.550
我就有时间在那里做一切我想做的
I'll have time there to do what I need to do.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.130
那是什么
Which is?

05:31.140 --> 05:32.050
一些琐碎的工作
A little work.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.510
一些准备工作
A little prep for your arrival.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.050
无论如何 这就是我的办法
That's the idea, anyway.

05:36.060 --> 05:37.140
办法
The idea?

05:37.150 --> 05:40.270
拿到 方纳克 需要费点力气 仅此而已
There's a little hitch in getting the PUGNAC.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.600
他们是不会在药房里卖这个药的
They don't exactly stock it at the commissary.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.940
费了半天劲就为了拿那几片药
This thing's riding on a bunch of pills?

05:44.950 --> 05:47.820
咱俩谈话的时候已经有人在想办法了
Someone's working on it as we speak.

05:51.950 --> 05:54.610
这时候相信一个黑人狱友 可不是什么明智之举 迈克尔
Now's not the time to trust a black inmate.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.620
我们的关系和种族无关
Our relationship transcends race.

05:56.630 --> 05:59.290
在这里没有什么能够超越种族歧视
Nothing transcends race in here.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.620
我不能让你这么做
I can't let you do it.

06:00.630 --> 06:02.710
好好表现 三年后你就会离开这里了
Good behaviour,you're outta here in three years.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.170
应该比那个早的多
Gonna be a whole lot sooner then that.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.010
根本行不通
It can't be done.

06:06.390 --> 06:07.380
根本行不通 迈克尔
Can't be done, Michael.

06:07.390 --> 06:08.880
没有人能从 狐狸河监狱 逃出去
No one's ever broken out of Fox River.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.800
一切都在掌握之中
Every step's already been mapped out.

06:10.810 --> 06:11.800
包括所有的可能性
Every contingency.

06:11.810 --> 06:14.010
所有的可能
Every contingency?

06:14.020 --> 06:15.510
虽然你有这地方的蓝图
You may have the blueprints of this place,

06:15.520 --> 06:18.300
但有一样东西你是无法控制的 那就是人
but there's one thing those plans can't show you...people,

06:18.310 --> 06:19.510
阿布鲁奇 那样的人
Guys like Abruzzi.

06:19.520 --> 06:23.280
你显然是看错他们了 他们迟早会对付你的
You so much as look at these guys the wrong way, they'll cut you up.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.060
对这些人而言
As far as these guys are concerned,

06:25.070 --> 06:27.480
我只不过是另一名虚度光阴囚犯
I'm just a con doing his time,

06:27.490 --> 06:28.690
不会有什么问题的
staying out of trouble.

06:28.700 --> 06:31.230
在这里不是你找麻烦 而是麻烦主动找你
You don't gotta look for trouble. It finds you.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.240
他们找上门来时 我们早已远走高飞了
And when it does, we'll be long gone.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.530
你简直疯了
This is madness.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.160
你连牢房都出不去
You can't get outta your cell.

06:36.170 --> 06:37.320
并非如此
Not true.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.740
什么 你有钥匙
What, you got a key?

06:38.750 --> 06:41.040
差不多吧
Something like that.

08:11.260 --> 08:12.920
坐错地方了 小嫩鸡
For the brothers at my side,Fish

08:12.930 --> 08:14.420
这里是帝博格的地盘
Belongs to T-Bag.

08:14.430 --> 08:16.390
谁
Who?

08:16.430 --> 08:18.300
你说话最好放尊重点 小嫩鸡
You best speak with respect, Fish.

08:18.310 --> 08:21.050
这家伙在巴马时绑架了不少孩子
Man kidnapped half a dozen boys and girls down in 'Bama,

08:21.060 --> 08:22.340
先奸后杀
raped 'em and killed 'em.

08:22.350 --> 08:24.850
先杀后奸也说不定
Wasn't always in that order, either.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.600
帝博格 有真实的姓名么
Does T-Bag have a real name?

08:26.610 --> 08:30.070
那就是我真正的名字
That is my real name.

08:31.660 --> 08:35.870
没事 没事 没事 请上坐
No, no, no. Please... sit.

08:37.620 --> 08:42.070
你就是传说中的那个新人
So you're the new one I been hearin' all the rave reviews about.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.950
斯科菲尔德
Scofield.

08:43.960 --> 08:47.300
你就和传说中的一样漂亮啊
One thing's for sure, you're just as pretty as advertised.

08:47.550 --> 08:49.760
甚至 更可爱
Prettier, even.

08:52.260 --> 08:54.000
黑鬼吓着你了 不是么
Rugheads got you scared, do they?

08:54.010 --> 08:54.790
你说啥?
Sorry?

08:54.800 --> 08:56.500
所以你才坐到这里
Assume that's why you're over here.

08:56.510 --> 08:57.710
进来的人都知道
Few days on the inside,

08:57.720 --> 09:00.840
虔诚的白人终于认清了现实
any God-fearing white man realizes the correctional system's

09:00.850 --> 09:04.720
在处理黑人和白人问题上 产生了严重的偏移
got a serious lean toward the African-American persuasion.

09:04.730 --> 09:05.550
我倒没发现
I hadn't noticed

09:05.560 --> 09:08.720
他们以为人多势众 就胜券在握了
They got the numbers all right, so they think they do as they please.

09:08.730 --> 09:10.810
有一个东西是他们所没有的
We got one thing they don't..

09:10.820 --> 09:12.480
那就是 突袭
surprise.

09:12.490 --> 09:15.610
我们很快就要大干一场了
We gonna take the ball game to them real soon.

09:15.620 --> 09:17.650
你第一次经历可能会比较难受
It's gonna be nasty for a first-timer like you

09:17.660 --> 09:20.360
不过我们会保护你的 我会保护你的
We'll protect you. I'll protect you.

09:20.370 --> 09:22.960
你要做的只是
All you gotta do is...

09:23.580 --> 09:25.660
抓住这只口袋
take this pocket right here

09:25.670 --> 09:27.740
这样生活将变得很美好
and your life'll be all peaches and cream.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.830
我走的时候你就跟着我
I walk, you walk with me.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.460
就没人敢伤害你
I'll keep you real close so no one up in here can hurt you.

09:33.470 --> 09:36.890
可你已经有女朋友了
Looks to me you already got a girlfriend.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.970
这里还有一个呢
I got a whole 'nother pocket over here.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.140
我会没事的
I'll pass.

09:45.860 --> 09:47.260
如果我不保护你
I don't protect you,

09:47.270 --> 09:50.560
黑人们会像对待一盘豆子一样把你吃掉
them rugheads gonna gobble you up like a plate of black-eyed peas.

09:50.570 --> 09:51.600
我说 不
I said no.

09:51.610 --> 09:53.810
那你现在就最好滚开
Then you'd best move, then.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.910
马上滚
Now.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.070
你有种再来我的地盘
You come around these bleachers again,

10:02.080 --> 10:05.700
就再也不是只动嘴说说了
it's gonna be more than just words we're exchanging.

10:05.710 --> 10:08.000
懂我的意思么
Know what I'm saying?

10:09.670 --> 10:10.910
不好意思
Excuse me.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.710
请问您是林肯·布伦斯的辩护律师 提姆·伊莱斯吗
Are you the Tim Giles that represented Lincoln Burrows?

10:13.720 --> 10:14.580
好吧 如果你是记者的话
Okay, if you're a reporter...

10:14.590 --> 10:17.890
我不是记者 我和被告认识
I'm not a reporter. I know the defendant.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.960
你们是亲戚
Oh. You family?

10:19.970 --> 10:21.880
也算不上
Not exactly.

10:21.890 --> 10:24.300
几年前我们曾交往过
We were in a relationship a few years back.

10:24.310 --> 10:25.720
你看 女士 我
Well, look, ma'am, I, uh...

10:25.730 --> 10:28.010
我不知道怎么告诉你 那个人的确有罪
I..I don't know what to tell you. I mean, the man was guilty.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.720
已经盖棺定论了
The prosecution's case was a slam dunk.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.020
就因为受害人是副总统的兄弟
Because the victim was the Vice President's brother.

10:33.030 --> 10:36.270
如果你指的是联邦政府介入的话
If you're suggesting that the federal government rammed this thing through,

10:36.280 --> 10:38.230
我也不想这样 毕竟我是他的辩护律师
okay,I take offense to that, 'cause I fought for that guy.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.650
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.990
证据就在那儿
The evidence was there.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.740
林肯 为斯蒂德曼的公司工作
Lincoln worked for Steadman's company.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.620
他当众和这个人发生争执 于是就被解雇了
He gets into a public altercation with the guy, so, he gets fired.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.120
两周后 斯蒂德曼被枪杀了
Two weeks later, Steadman's shot dead.

10:49.130 --> 10:50.870
凶器在林肯家被找到
The murder weapon is found in Lincoln's house,

10:50.880 --> 10:53.160
而且他衣服上还有受害人的血迹
and the victim's blood found on his clothes

10:53.170 --> 10:55.750
相信我 的确有很多案件使你夜不能眠
Trust me, there are cases you lose sleep over, but

10:55.760 --> 10:58.180
但决不是这件
this isn't one of 'em

10:59.050 --> 11:00.420
那么 克拉勃·西蒙思 呢
What about Crab Simmons?

11:00.430 --> 11:02.090
林肯 说他能为他作证
Lincoln said he could exonerate him.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.840
为什么你不让他出庭呢
Why didn't you put him on the stand?

11:03.850 --> 11:06.090
那哥们已经 五进宫了
The man's a five-time felon, all right?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.800
他 他毫无信誉可言
He-He... He had no credibility.

11:07.810 --> 11:10.010
你不介意我去拜访一下他吧
So you wouldn't mind if I paid him a visit?

11:10.020 --> 11:13.480
你随便 但我觉得这对你一点好处都没有
Be my guest.But I don't think it'll do you any good.

11:33.050 --> 11:37.800
感觉很奇怪 我也说不清是怎么回事
Strange feeling. Don't know how to explain it.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.640
现在
Now, um...

11:41.680 --> 11:45.380
我的生活一直充斥着疯狂
usually, my whole life, it's always been crazy,

11:45.390 --> 11:47.180
喧嚣
noisy,

11:47.520 --> 11:51.190
甚至发狂 但是
maddening, you know, in my head, but...

11:51.270 --> 11:53.440
现在却很平静
right now, it's quiet.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.190
很完美
It's perfect.

11:56.610 --> 11:59.030
你回来我很高兴
I'm glad you came back.

12:00.490 --> 12:03.740
我时时刻刻都惦记着你
I thought about you the whole time.

12:03.950 --> 12:07.070
你也知道 我这一生犯了不少错误
You know, I made a lot of mistakes in my life.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.000
我也知道错了
I know that.

12:09.370 --> 12:11.320
我想改正
I'm gonna make it right.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.590
我知道你会的
I know you will.

12:21.970 --> 12:23.380
你要干什么
What are you doing?

12:23.390 --> 12:24.590
我想要留住这一刻
I want to remember this.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.250
不要
No.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.590
别这样 来吧 拜托 就一张
Oh, come on. Come on, Vi, please. Just one.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.640
好吧
OK.

12:39.070 --> 12:40.020
别紧张 伙计
Easy, man.

12:40.030 --> 12:41.270
方纳克 搞定了吗
How are we doing on the PUGNAC?

12:41.280 --> 12:42.690
嘿 我正在想办法呢
Hey, I'm working on it.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.110
你得抓紧 我今晚就需要那个东西
Well, work faster. I need that stuff tonight.

12:45.120 --> 12:49.990
医务室有什么东西这么吸引你
What's up there in that infirmary that you need so bad?

12:50.000 --> 12:53.500
帮我搞到 方纳克 或许我会告诉你
You get me that PUGNAC and maybe I'll tell you.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.300
我认为咱们说的已经够明白的了
Thought we had an understanding.

13:12.310 --> 13:14.260
这里只提供给家庭成员
This here's for the family.

13:14.270 --> 13:17.220
你已经表明不是家庭成员了
You made it pretty clear you ain't blood.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.570
把那东西拿过来怎样
How about you hand that over?

13:31.870 --> 13:33.740
不错的钢条 只需稍做加工
Nice looking piece of steel,bit of work.

13:33.750 --> 13:36.540
就能成为很好的武器
You could do some serious damage with it.

13:37.420 --> 13:40.840
可问题是 你究竟想伤害谁呢
Question is, who was it you was plannin' on damaging?

13:40.970 --> 13:43.210
我曾看到你和黑鬼在一起
I seen you with the Negroes, you know.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.380
或许你已经成为他们中的一员了
Well, maybe you're one of them milk chickens,

13:45.390 --> 13:47.090
还一脸茫然
all confused, like.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.510
外表是白人 骨子里却像石油一样黑
White on the outside,black as tar on the inside.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.680
真想到你体内看一下 你说是吧
Maybe we oughta take a look at them insides and find out.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.260
女童子军们
Girl Scouts,

13:55.270 --> 13:58.110
你们那里有什么问题么
is there a problem over there?

14:00.070 --> 14:03.450
咱们今天就算了 如果你觉得没问题的话
I think we'll just hang onto this if that's OK with you.

14:03.740 --> 14:08.660
我的话只说一遍 赶快解散 娘娘腔们
Hey! I'm not gonna ask you again.Let's break up the party, ladies.

14:08.700 --> 14:12.040
你也听到他的话了吧 小可怜
You heard the man, little doggie.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.750
走吧
Get along.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.400
怎么才能制服一个狱友
What's it take to shake down another inmate?

15:53.410 --> 15:55.610
让他归还本来属于你的东西
Get something he's taken from you?

15:55.620 --> 15:57.490
我要 菲波纳奇 作为交换
It would take Fibonacci.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.410
我会给你 菲波纳奇 的
Well, I'll give you Fibonacci.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.240
我答应过你
I promise you that.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.700
等时机成熟了
When the time is right.

16:02.710 --> 16:04.450
时机已经很成熟了
The time is right now.

16:04.460 --> 16:07.960
当咱俩都站在高墙之外时才可以
No, when you and I are both standing outside those walls.

16:07.970 --> 16:09.960
不用过着假释的生活
You're on life without parole.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.920
跨越高墙是多么遥不可及的阿
You'll never stand outside those walls.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.050
除非你认识什么人
Not unless you knew someone,

16:14.060 --> 16:16.260
而这个人知道如何离开这里
someone who knew a way out.

16:16.270 --> 16:17.760
你认为如何 约翰
What do you say, John?

16:17.770 --> 16:21.150
你简直是年度最佳鬼扯编剧
I say I've heard nothing but blabber.

16:41.290 --> 16:43.660
菲利·法佐尼
Philly Falzone.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.500
真是荣幸
It's an honour.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.870
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

16:47.880 --> 16:49.250
我 嗯...
Well, I, um...

16:49.260 --> 16:51.920
我一直认为我们亲如兄弟
I just thought we'd, you know, fraternize

16:51.930 --> 16:53.920
他还真像 不是么
He looks like it, doesn't he?

16:53.930 --> 16:55.210
像什么
Looks what?

16:55.220 --> 16:57.090
就像大家说的一样
Like everybody's been saying.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.470
你没有睾丸
You got no sack.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.010
你被阉了
You've been neutered.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.390
你不应该这么和我说话
You shouldn't talk to me like that.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.930
你过去是给我洗衣服的
You used to pick up my laundry.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.270
时过境迁了 约翰
Not any more.

17:06.280 --> 17:10.350
约翰 传闻这里有人知道 菲波纳奇 的下落
John,word is that someone in here knows where Fibonacci is,

17:10.360 --> 17:11.860
可是你却无动于衷
and you're not doing anything about it.

17:11.870 --> 17:12.860
我正在办呢
I'm working on it.

17:12.870 --> 17:15.070
我想你的速度还不够快
Well, you're not working on it fast enough.

17:15.080 --> 17:18.150
很显然 菲波纳奇 很快就要露面了
Apparently, Fibonacci's coming up for air again.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.660
下月有个听证会
Next month, a Congressional hearing.

17:20.670 --> 17:24.030
如果他去作证的话
Now, if he testifies at that hearing,

17:24.040 --> 17:26.330
会有很多人要倒台的
a lot of people are going down,

17:26.340 --> 17:28.330
包括我
including me.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.670
咱们也认识好久了
Now, I've known you a long time.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.130
咱们的妻子又都是好朋友
Our wives are friends,

17:32.140 --> 17:34.890
咱们的孩子又在同一所天主教学校读书
our kids go to the same Catholic school

17:35.430 --> 17:40.340
你孩子要是出了意外 我会感到很惭愧的
Now, it would be a shame if anything were to happen to your kids.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.800
我的孩子会想他们的
I know my kids would miss them.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.260
你没必要这么做
You don't need to do this.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.010
我有
I do.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.470
我会找到这个人的
I'll get this guy.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.940
然后搞定 菲波纳奇
We'll get Fibonacci.

17:49.690 --> 17:51.900
好 为了大家 希望你是对的
Well, for everyone's sake, I hope you're right.

17:51.910 --> 17:53.360
没错
I am.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.570
保重 约翰
Be well, John.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.740
多谢
Thank you.

18:07.590 --> 18:10.760
长官 我要打电话
Yo, badge, I gotta use the phone.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.460

Sure. You want a pizza and a pedicure too?

18:15.470 --> 18:16.590
不 今天是周一 天啊
No. It's-It's Monday, man.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.460
我要给女朋友打电话 她在等我的电话呢
I gotta call my girl. She's expecting my call.

18:18.470 --> 18:20.300
闭上你的臭嘴吧 你什么都别想了
Put a sock in it. You got nothin' comin'.

18:20.310 --> 18:22.560
不 不 不
No, no, no, man! No, man!

18:29.650 --> 18:32.700
查一下名单
Hey, pull up the manifest.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.870
在数据库里有个叫 艾伦·施瓦茨 的人么
Is there an Allen Schweitzer in gen pop?

18:39.660 --> 18:40.650
没有
No.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.780
隔离室里呢
How about the SHU?

18:42.790 --> 18:43.700
没有
No.

18:43.710 --> 18:44.950
为什么问这个
Why you asking?

18:44.960 --> 18:47.080
好奇而已
Curious, that's all.

19:25.870 --> 19:27.910
听到号角声了么 小嫩鸡
You hear the trumpets, Fish?

19:27.920 --> 19:29.780
我知道你听到了
I know you hear'em.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.790
末日审判
That's Judgment Day

19:31.800 --> 19:35.170
就快来了 很快
It's comin'... real soon

20:01.530 --> 20:04.660
你在我这里干什么
What are you doing in my cell?

20:08.880 --> 20:10.790
我要加入
I want in.

20:20.180 --> 20:21.670
我没听清楚 小嫩鸡
I'm not quite sure I heard that, Fish.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.170
你说你要加入
Did you just say you're in?

20:23.180 --> 20:24.130
没错
That's right.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.300
有句老话说的好
You know the old saying, don't you?

20:25.310 --> 20:27.470
得寸进尺
In for an inch, in for a mile.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.640
无论有什么后果
Whatever it takes.

20:28.650 --> 20:30.010
你让我打 我就打
You want me to fight, I'll fight.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.140
看台的那个螺钉 就是用来做这个的
The bolt from the bleachers-- that's what it was for

20:32.150 --> 20:36.690
你想要打架 会有机会的
Well, you wanna fight,you're gonna get your chance.

20:36.740 --> 20:37.730
下一次点名
Next count.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.560
-今晚 -有什么问题么
-Tonight? -Problem with that?

20:39.570 --> 20:41.520
因为我们要从正面打垮他们
'Cause we goin' straight at 'em.

20:41.530 --> 20:43.940
你最好先有个准备 小嫩鸡
Better catch a square, Fish.

20:43.950 --> 20:45.780
我们人手极缺
We undermanned in a big way.

20:45.790 --> 20:47.030
我需要武器
All I need's a weapon.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.670
你想要武器么 狗娘养的
You want a weapon, bitch?

20:50.210 --> 20:52.580
给你
There you go.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.580
犯人都回到自己牢房
All prisoners return to cells.

20:54.590 --> 20:58.620
在干大事之前你必须向我们证实你的忠诚
You have to prove yourself before we trust you with the heavy artillery.

20:58.630 --> 20:59.830
懂我的话么
Know what I'm sayin'?

20:59.840 --> 21:01.760
关上门
Gates closing

21:10.060 --> 21:13.100
我为上次的匆忙对话向您道歉
I wanted to apologize for being so short with you before.

21:13.110 --> 21:14.010
没事
No problem.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.930
越是接近死刑执行日
Closer it gets to an execution,

21:15.940 --> 21:19.610
形势就越发的紧张 我想把这个交给你
the harder it becomes, so that's why I wanted to give you this.

21:20.160 --> 21:23.150
这是事发当晚车库的监控录像
It's the, uh, surveillance tape of the garage that night.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.900
封闭的庭审 所以法庭以外的人都看不到
It was a closed trial, so no one outside of the courtroom saw it.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.900
希望能对你有所帮助
I thought it could help you out.

21:27.910 --> 21:30.460
-帮助我什么 -放弃
-With what? -Closure.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.130
艾伦·施瓦茨
Allen Schweitzer.

22:21.260 --> 22:23.760
这个名字和你有关么
That name mean anything to you?

22:25.010 --> 22:25.960
应该有吗
Should it?

22:25.970 --> 22:28.180
我不知道 所以才来问你
I don't know. You tell me.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.130
从没听说过
Never heard of the guy.

22:32.140 --> 22:33.970
你确定
Are you sure?

22:33.980 --> 22:35.520
我确定
Positive.

22:59.210 --> 23:02.090
你还好么 小白脸
Ah, what's up, snowflake?

23:08.350 --> 23:11.180
你以为我傻
Do you think I'm a fool?

23:11.850 --> 23:13.260
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

23:13.270 --> 23:16.730
我看到你和 希特勒·犹思 在一起
I see you up there with the Hitler Youth.

23:18.110 --> 23:20.770
我现在就想把你大卸八块
I got a good mind to slash you open right now.

23:20.780 --> 23:22.770
并不像你想象中的那样
It's not what you think.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.770
他们有我想要的东西
They've got something I need.

23:24.780 --> 23:27.310
真好笑
Now, see, that's funny,

23:27.320 --> 23:30.410
因为我也有你想要的
because I got something you need too.

23:31.750 --> 23:35.040
你不是想要 方纳克么
You want your PUGNAC, fish? Huh?

23:37.460 --> 23:40.670
都在这里 亲爱的 都是你的了
I hate 'em, baby. So will you.

23:43.470 --> 23:46.880
你的好运到此为止了
Listen, white boy. Your luckjust ran out.

23:47.510 --> 23:50.010
你选错阵营了
You chose the wrong side.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.050
看到你真高兴
Man, it's great to see your face.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.700
别再玩了 好不
I think it's time you quit the charade,don't you?

24:42.710 --> 24:43.370
什么
What?

24:43.380 --> 24:46.130
别人的生活都被你破坏了
It's starting to ruin people's lives.

24:47.590 --> 24:50.380
迈克尔也进来了 只因为他认为你是无辜的
Michael's in here 'cos he thinks you're innocent.

24:50.390 --> 24:51.840
他告诉你的
What's he told you?

24:51.850 --> 24:54.590
他什么都没告诉我 但是我知道 林肯
He hasn't told me anything, but I know.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.840
我知道他是怎么想的
I know what he's planning.

24:56.850 --> 24:58.550
叫他停手吧
Call him off.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.560
你要是爱他的话 就叫他停手吧
If you love him, call him off.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.810
我看过录像带了
I saw the tape.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.350
那是伪造的
That's not how it went down.

25:06.360 --> 25:07.980
我知道我看见的是什么
I know what I saw.

25:07.990 --> 25:09.650
我只知道我看到的
I know what I saw.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.620
我当时在场 还记得么
I was there, remember?

25:15.620 --> 25:17.070
那晚我喝多了
I got high that night.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.240
我是被逼的
I had to.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.000
我别无选择
It was the only way I could go through with it.

25:34.430 --> 25:36.090
我根本没开枪
I never pulled the trigger.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.230
那人早已经死了
The guy was already dead.

25:39.730 --> 25:40.890
是的 当然 你和我说过不下千遍了
Yeah, I know. You've told me a thousand...

25:40.900 --> 25:43.010
听着 我是被陷害的
Then listen! I was set up!

25:43.020 --> 25:44.560
我那晚去那只是想让他还钱
I went there that night to clear a debt.

25:44.570 --> 25:47.480
克拉勃·西蒙思 要我还他的9万美元
Crab Simmons was on my ass for the 90 grand I owed him.

25:47.490 --> 25:49.350
他告诉我目标是个毒犯
He told me the mark was some scumbag drug dealer

25:49.360 --> 25:51.230
事成之后 我们就两清了
and if I took it we'd be clean.

25:51.240 --> 25:52.520
我根本就没扣扳机
I never pulled the trigger

25:52.530 --> 25:55.900
我所知道的就是有人想让我去 特伦斯.斯蒂德曼 所在的车库
All I know is that somebody wanted me in the same garage as Terrence Steadman that night.

25:55.910 --> 25:58.540
他们为什么要陷害你
Why would somebody want to set you up?

26:00.920 --> 26:03.370
不是我 是他
It wasn't about me. It was about him.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.160
斯蒂德曼
Steadman?

26:04.170 --> 26:05.030
是的
Yes.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.330
他就像个圣人
The guy was like a saint

26:06.340 --> 26:07.540
从事慈善事业
All the charity work,

26:07.550 --> 26:10.160
还有他公司在做的环保改革
the environmental progress his company was making...

26:10.170 --> 26:14.590
这里只有你一人有杀害他的动机
About the only person in this entire country who had motive to kill him was you.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.760
你来这就是想说我有罪么
You came all the way down here to tell me how guilty I am?

26:19.930 --> 26:22.350
我也不知道自己来的目的
I don't know why I came here.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.560
你现在有了自己的生活
You have your life now. I know that.

26:28.570 --> 26:30.310
我知道
I know that...

26:30.320 --> 26:33.400
如果你念旧情的话
but if what we had before meant anything to you,

26:33.410 --> 26:36.240
希望你能找到真相
you'd find out the truth.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.660
或许这就是事实呢
Maybe all this is the truth.

26:41.370 --> 26:43.790
又或许他们是对的呢
Maybe they got it right.

27:19.490 --> 27:20.400
长官
Badge!

27:20.410 --> 27:22.740
开门啊 长官
Open up, Badge!

27:22.750 --> 27:23.700
又怎么了
You talking again?

27:23.710 --> 27:24.700
今天是我女朋友的生日
It's my girl's birthday.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.950
那祝她生日快乐好了
Happy birthday to her, then.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.070
让我给她打个电话吧 求你了
You gotta let me call her! Please!

27:27.080 --> 27:28.830
如果你让我给她打电话的话 我给你一百万
I'll give you a million dollars, if you let me use the phone.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.200
我看过你的帐户 苏克雷
I seen your kicks, Sucre.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.410
你名下好像只有40美分
You got something like 40 cents to your name.

27:32.420 --> 27:33.330
求你了
Please!

27:33.340 --> 27:35.930
天啊 不要
God, no!

27:57.820 --> 28:01.320
你好啊 玛丽克鲁兹 还在等什么 快来吧
All right. Maricruz. What are you doing? Come on.

28:01.330 --> 28:03.900
没关系 赫克特 你去吧
Yeah, it's okay, Hector. You go ahead.

28:03.910 --> 28:05.490
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

28:05.500 --> 28:07.370
我想我还是找辆出租吧
I think I'm just going to take a cab.

28:07.380 --> 28:11.090
你说什么 回家 不是刚到么
What do you mean, like, go home? I mean, you just got here.

28:14.550 --> 28:17.180
他没给你打电话 是不
He didn't call you, did he?

28:18.970 --> 28:24.340
我也非常喜欢 费尔南多 但这家伙游手好闲
Look... I love Fernando to death, but the guy's a deadbeat.

28:24.350 --> 28:26.730
你的生活还要继续
You got to move on with your life.

28:34.570 --> 28:35.770
伊莱斯 先生
Mr. Giles,

28:35.780 --> 28:36.980
如果可以 还能否找您谈谈
we'd like to have a word with you, if we could.

28:36.990 --> 28:38.270
我真的很忙
I really don't have time.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.950
不好意思 情况紧急
I'm afraid we're going to have to insist.

28:42.030 --> 28:44.110
我们注意到是您提出了信息公开申请
It's come to our attention that you made a FOIL request

28:44.120 --> 28:46.870
就在几天前 关于布伦斯的案子
a couple of days ago, on the Burrows case.

28:47.710 --> 28:49.780
是的 那么
Yeah. So?

28:49.790 --> 28:52.330
记录显示你您把监控录像做了拷贝
Records show that you made a dupe of the surveillance tape.

28:52.340 --> 28:54.040
没错
That's right.

28:54.050 --> 28:56.260
能知道为什么吗
Mind us asking why?

28:56.420 --> 28:59.250
是为了他的一个前任女友
It's for one of Burrows' old girlfriends, man.

28:59.260 --> 29:01.750
她一直坚信那个人是无辜的
She was under the impression that the guy was innocent.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.630
于是我就想让她早点放弃算了
I figured it'd, you know, help her with closure

29:03.640 --> 29:05.760
那么现在录像带在她那里
She's in possession of the tape now, then?

29:05.770 --> 29:07.260
别跟我这样
Don't pull that card on me.

29:07.270 --> 29:09.090
信息公开自由
It's the Freedom of Information Act.

29:09.100 --> 29:11.800
她有权拥有那盘录像带
She's entitled to that tape as much as you or I are.

29:11.810 --> 29:14.310
是的 是的 没错
Oh,no, no, by all means, by all means.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.640
-我可以走了么 -还有一件事
-May I go now? -Just one more thing.

29:16.650 --> 29:19.060
他这个前女友
This old girlfriend of his...

29:19.070 --> 29:21.240
叫什么名字
what's her name?

29:33.040 --> 29:34.120
不好意思
Excuse me.

29:34.130 --> 29:35.830
西蒙思 是住这儿么
Is this the Simmons residence?

29:35.840 --> 29:37.620
我是 西蒙思 太太
I'm Ms. Simmons.

29:37.630 --> 29:39.540
对不起 我
I'm sorry. Um,

29:39.550 --> 29:41.460
我是 维罗妮卡·多诺万
I'm Veronica Donovan.

29:41.470 --> 29:44.250
我想找一下 克拉勃·西蒙思 你们是亲戚么
I'm looking for Crab Simmons. Are you related?

29:44.260 --> 29:45.590
他是我儿子
He's my son.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.220
他在家么
Is he around?

29:47.230 --> 29:48.510
不在
No.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.720
能告诉我在哪能找到他么
Could you tell me where I could find him?

29:49.730 --> 29:52.680
女士 你走吧 我帮不了你 难道你还不明白么
Lady, go away. I can't help you. Can't you understand that?

29:52.690 --> 29:55.190
实在抱歉 我只是
Look, I'm sorry.It's just...

29:55.650 --> 29:59.690
有人危在旦夕 或许您的儿子能帮上忙
a man's life is at stake,and maybe your son can help him.

29:59.740 --> 30:01.940
克拉勃已经帮不上谁的忙了 女士
Crab can't help nobody, lady.

30:01.950 --> 30:04.280
他已经死了
He's dead

30:06.240 --> 30:08.160
对不起
I'm sorry.

30:20.840 --> 30:24.800
注意 都站到门口
Heads up! 7-up, cons, stand your gate!

30:28.980 --> 30:31.390
好戏就要上演了 小嫩鸡
'Bout to jump off, Fish.

30:46.740 --> 30:49.330
鲍尔 回到你的位置
Ballard, get back on your number.

30:51.000 --> 30:51.570
请求支援
I need backup

30:51.580 --> 30:54.290
我说了回到原位
I said back on your number!

31:55.980 --> 31:58.560
救我
Help me...

32:02.740 --> 32:04.780
斯科菲尔德
Scofield!

32:41.320 --> 32:44.430
你死定了 斯科菲尔德
You're a dead man, Scofield!

32:44.440 --> 32:46.730
你听见了么
You hear me?!

32:46.740 --> 32:49.320
你死定了
You're a dead man!

33:35.700 --> 33:38.320
我不知道该说你们什么了
I really don't know what to say to you gentlemen.

33:38.830 --> 33:41.320
我试着不去怀疑你们
I try to give you the benefit of the doubt,

33:41.330 --> 33:43.870
试着去尊重你们
I try to treat you with respect.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.620
但你们自己却不尊重自己
You can't even respect yourselves.

33:47.630 --> 33:50.620
今后的48小时 将是一级防范禁闭期
So, there's going to be a 48-hour lockdown.

33:50.630 --> 33:52.540
不许吃饭 不许洗澡
No mess. No showers.

33:52.550 --> 33:54.720
不许探监
No visitation.

33:54.970 --> 33:59.710
我强烈建议你们学会相处
And I strongly suggest that you all learn to get along.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.510
否则的话 下次将会是一周
Otherwise, the next time, it's going to be a week,

34:01.520 --> 34:04.300
再往后 就有可能是一个月
and the time after that, it's going to be a month.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.480
好好想想吧
Think about it.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.840
有位叫 莱提莎·巴里斯 的人找你
Got a Leticia Barres on the line.

34:40.850 --> 34:42.590
我不认识他 先让她留言吧
I don't know who that is. Take a message.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.470
她说她曾和 克拉勃·西蒙思 约会过
She says she used to date Crab Simmons.

34:48.770 --> 34:50.640
莱提莎 很感谢你能来电
Leticia, thank you for calling.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.010
要是想和我谈话
You want to hear what I have to say,

34:52.020 --> 34:54.390
我们必须在公共场合会面 这样他们就抓不到我们了
we meet in a public place, where they can't get to us.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.770
等等 等等 等等 谁要抓咱们
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where who can't get to us?

34:56.780 --> 34:58.560
你到底要不要听我说
You want to hear what I have to say or not?

34:58.570 --> 35:00.690
要是不想听的话 我马上就挂
'Cause if you don't, I'm going to hang up right now.

35:00.700 --> 35:04.330
不 不 不 请告诉我时间和地点
No, no, no... you just name the time and the place.

35:08.330 --> 35:09.490
这里
Over here

35:09.500 --> 35:10.820
莱提莎 非常感谢你能来
Leticia, thanks for coming..

35:10.830 --> 35:11.830
省省吧 女士
Go easy, lady

35:11.840 --> 35:13.580
我们素不相识 明白吗
We don't know each other, you got that?

35:13.590 --> 35:16.120
在这里他们就没法抓到我们了
We'll stay out here in the open where they can't get to us.

35:16.130 --> 35:18.720
在这他们不能做他们想做的
Where they can't do what they do.

35:19.470 --> 35:20.790
我想和你谈话的唯一理由
Only reason why I'm talking to you

35:20.800 --> 35:22.960
就是因为他们会像杀我的丈夫那样来 对付你的男友
'cause they gonna kill your boy like they killed mine.

35:22.970 --> 35:25.420
验尸报告说是海洛因害死了你丈夫 莱提莎
Coroner's report says smack killed your boyfriend, Leticia.

35:25.430 --> 35:27.510
是吸食过量所致 不是吸食过量
It was an overdose. Wasn't no overdose

35:27.520 --> 35:28.380
你什么意思
What do you mean?

35:28.390 --> 35:30.800
克拉勃从不吸毒 他有心脏病
Crab didn't use. He had a bad heart.

35:30.810 --> 35:32.680
要是沾上毒品的话 会使他毙命
If he touched the stuff, it'd kill him.

35:32.690 --> 35:34.890
你不觉得事情太巧合了么
I mean, don't you think it's just the slightest bit of a coincidence

35:34.900 --> 35:37.890
在你男朋友出事后一周他就死了
he OD'd a week after your boyfriend's crime?

35:37.900 --> 35:40.560
他们是要杀他灭口
They killed him 'cause he knew things.

35:40.570 --> 35:41.940
他们不想让事情泄漏出去
Things they didn't want to get out.

35:41.950 --> 35:42.560
比如
Like what?

35:42.570 --> 35:44.820
比如谁是那晚的真凶
Like who was really behind that hit that night.

35:44.830 --> 35:46.230
肯定不是 克拉勃
Wasn't Crab, that's for damn sure

35:46.240 --> 35:47.940
也肯定不是 林肯
And it sure as hell wasn't Lincoln

35:47.950 --> 35:49.910
他们俩根本就不知道是怎么被卷进去的
Neither of them boys knew what they were getting into.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.160
他们都被别人利用了
They were just pawns in a big game

35:52.170 --> 35:52.870
你说什么
What?

35:52.880 --> 35:54.280
-他们来了 -谁来了 莱提莎
-They're here. -Who's here, Leticia?

35:54.290 --> 35:55.450
别跟着我
Don't try to follow me.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.080
也不要找我 我是不会作证的
Don't find me. I won't testify.

35:57.090 --> 35:58.750
能不能再和我说说
Just slow down and talk to me.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.210
你我还是走的越远越好
I'd get as far away from here as you can, girl.

36:01.220 --> 36:03.890
因为没有他们抓不到的人
'Cause there ain't nobody they can't get to.

36:05.010 --> 36:07.060
莱提莎
Leticia!

36:41.550 --> 36:42.920
您好
Hello?

36:42.930 --> 36:45.170
遇到点小麻烦
We have a small complication.

36:45.180 --> 36:47.340
有个律师牵扯进来了
There's a lawyer poking around.

36:47.350 --> 36:49.640
维罗妮卡·多诺万
Veronica Donovan.

36:50.020 --> 36:51.510
是的
Yes.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.050
你应该能搞定一个
You can handle a girl who graduated

36:54.060 --> 36:57.390
从贝纳法学院毕业的女孩
in the middle of her Baylor law school class.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.600
至少我是这么认为的
At least I'd like to think so,

36:59.610 --> 37:03.240
不能拿咱们正在做的事情冒险
given the stakes of what we're dealing with here.

37:08.120 --> 37:12.650
任何危害到咱们的人都要消灭
Anyone that's a threat to what we're doing is expendable.

37:12.660 --> 37:13.860
任何人
Anyone.

37:13.870 --> 37:14.990
明白
Understood.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.090
那就尽你所能把事情做好吧
Then do what you need to do to make this go away.

37:31.640 --> 37:34.060
你在么 亲爱的
You there, Pretty?

37:38.230 --> 37:40.360
我知道你在
I know you're there.

37:40.610 --> 37:44.190
我会来找你的
Just want you to know I'm coming for you.

37:44.200 --> 37:47.280
你哪儿也跑不了
You got nowhere to run.

37:47.450 --> 37:51.110
你被困在自己的小洞里了
You're trapped in that little hole of yours.

37:51.120 --> 37:55.370
就像一只无路可逃的猪 等着被我屠杀
Trapped like a pig I'm going to slaughter.

39:25.420 --> 39:26.500
谁一点钟来看病
Who's my 1:00?

39:26.510 --> 39:28.590
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Uh, Michael Scofield.

39:31.140 --> 39:34.460
我误会你了斯科菲尔德 这是你要的 方纳克
I was wrong about you, Scofield. Here's your PUGNAC.

39:34.470 --> 39:35.880
稍微有点晚
Little bit late.

39:35.890 --> 39:37.470
但总比没有强 对吧
Better late than never, right?

39:37.480 --> 39:39.510
斯科菲尔德 去医务室
Scofield! Infirmary!

39:39.520 --> 39:42.310
去看看就知道了
We'll see about that.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.390
我迟早会知道的
I'm gonna find out, you know...

39:46.400 --> 39:49.110
你去那里的真正目的
what it is you're doing up there.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.450
需要多长时间
How long does this take?

40:00.460 --> 40:01.780
过去会花上几个小时
It used to take hours.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.450
他们最终发明了新的葡萄糖检测仪器
They've come a long way with the new glucose kits

40:03.460 --> 40:05.740
现在只需10妙
This'll take us about ten seconds.

40:05.750 --> 40:08.880
将剥片放进仪器 结果会马上出来
Slide the strip into the meter, we're ready to go.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.380
我想你肯定知道
I'm sure you know this,

40:12.390 --> 40:16.460
非糖尿病患者的 平均葡萄糖含量是每公升1000毫克
but average glucose for the non-diabetic is about 100 milligrams per deciliter,

40:16.470 --> 40:20.390
如果结果在这个范围内 就说明误诊了
so we see a number like that here, and we know you've been misdiagnosed.

40:28.070 --> 40:30.070
你看起来很紧张
You seem nervous.

40:30.740 --> 40:31.810
有么
I do?

40:31.820 --> 40:33.440
你在出汗
You're sweating.

40:33.450 --> 40:35.360
一定是因为打针的缘故
Must be the needles.

40:35.370 --> 40:37.940
一直不太习惯打针
Never really got used to them.

40:37.950 --> 40:41.790
你患糖尿病还纹身 真不敢相信
Somehow, with diabetes and that tattoo, I find that hard to believe.

40:45.670 --> 40:48.250
恐怕是坏消息
Bad news, I'm afraid.

40:50.720 --> 40:54.970
每公升含1800毫克 你的确得了糖尿病
180 milligrams per deciliter. You're definitely diabetic.

41:01.020 --> 41:03.510
还需要我做些什么不
Do you need anything else from me?

41:03.520 --> 41:05.510
做好打针的准备
Arm to stick a needle in.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.010
没问题
Okay.

41:07.020 --> 41:09.070
星期三见
I'll see you Wednesday.

41:09.730 --> 41:13.030
-有意思 -一个囚犯而已
-Cute. -Prisoner.

41:14.410 --> 41:16.900
我也说不好 他看起来有点古怪
I don't know. There's something strange about him.

41:16.910 --> 41:17.940
你说什么
What do you mean?

41:17.950 --> 41:19.440
我告诉他验血结果
I gave him the results of his blood test,

41:19.450 --> 41:20.940
他脸上却表现出
and there was this look on his face.

41:20.950 --> 41:22.910
某种 嗯
It was, um...

41:23.870 --> 41:25.830
解脱的表情
relief.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.370
没事
It's all right

41:29.380 --> 41:30.620
我带他走吧
I got it.

41:30.630 --> 41:33.840
正好我正要去A区呢
I'm headed over to A-Wing anyhow.

41:35.390 --> 41:37.460
您看起来气色不错 长官
You're positively beaming, boss.

41:37.470 --> 41:41.260
人逢喜事精神爽
Got up on the right side of the bed this morning, I guess.

41:41.270 --> 41:42.590
等一下
Hold up.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.720
我去加点糖
Sugar.

41:43.730 --> 41:45.900
别乱动 小嫩鸡
Don't you move, Fishy.

41:47.310 --> 41:48.310
