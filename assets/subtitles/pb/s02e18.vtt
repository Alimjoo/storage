一个他们不想让我们听到的对话

应该得到赏钱的人

if you'd returned any of my calls, I wouldn't have had to.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.190
我们说好的

02:54.200 --> 02:55.890
我们说好的是你尽量别被人发现
The deal was that you stay under the radar.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.720
你做的很好啊 光头?

02:57.730 --> 02:59.890
这里到处都是联邦探员

02:59.900 --> 03:01.590
他们都看见你的长相了

03:01.600 --> 03:03.490
我才不在乎
Yeah, I don't care what they see.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.390
如果你不给我钱的话
Hell, if you don't pay up

03:06.400 --> 03:10.030

03:26.530 --> 03:27.720

但你要耐心点
But you're gonna have to be patient.

03:31.730 --> 03:34.750
如果你再...
And if you ever...

03:34.760 --> 03:36.890
踏进我的办公室
come in my office again,

03:36.900 --> 03:40.220
你不但看不到现金
you'll not only never see the cash

03:40.230 --> 03:43.960
而且肯定见不到下一次日出了
you'll never see another sunrise.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.950
现在我们还要嚷嚷

03:52.960 --> 03:54.790
你将要得到的那笔钱吗?
now, are we gonna keep crying about money you've already got coming to you?

03:54.800 --> 03:57.990
或者你还想多挣点?
Or do you want to make some more?

03:58.000 --> 04:01.700

04:02.130 --> 04:05.230
去过墨西哥吗?

04:05.930 --> 04:08.920
我们把这个交给媒体
We give this thing to the press

04:08.930 --> 04:10.790
政府将会质疑它
the government's gonna discredit it

04:10.800 --> 04:12.990
就像怀疑我们录制的那个录像一样
just like they did with the tape we made

04:13.000 --> 04:14.420
那么...
Okay.

04:14.430 --> 04:17.620
那我们拿它怎么办?
So what do we do with it?

04:19.430 --> 04:20.650
和他一起工作的人能帮助我们

如果把这给他们最终会找到

无可辩驳的罪证让卡罗琳.莱娜斯垮台
the smoking gun they need to bring Caroline Reynolds down.

04:28.330 --> 04:29.790
而不是我们
not us.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.490
她怎么能怀疑她任命的人呢
And how can she discredit her own appointees? Sure.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.290
我们唯一能证明我无罪
We're gonna give the only thing that can exonerate me

04:34.300 --> 04:36.290
的东西交给政府里工作的某个人?
to someone who works for the government?

04:36.300 --> 04:39.690
那个陷害我的政府?!
The same government that set me up?

04:39.700 --> 04:42.490
我们必须找到我们信任的人
We'll have to find someone we can trust

04:42.500 --> 04:44.220
诚实的人
someone honest.

04:44.230 --> 04:46.020
简 菲利普斯

04:46.030 --> 04:47.890
她知道谁能帮助我们

她和我父亲一起工作 并照顾LJ
She worked with dad; she's watching LJ

04:49.860 --> 04:51.490
我信任她 迈克尔
I trust her, Michael.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.960
让她去找我们需要的人
She'll do it; she'll find someone.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.060
好吧 但愿你是对的
Well, I hope you're right.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.900
因为这是我们最后一击
Because this is our last shot.

05:03.660 --> 05:05.890
这个很不错
This'll do you right

05:05.900 --> 05:08.350
这是雷明登700狙击步枪
She's a remington 700.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.950
她很准吗?

05:28.260 --> 05:31.350
序列号已清除了
Serial numbers have been cleaned.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.450
为了摆脱弹道，枪膛已经被刮花了
Chamber's been scraped to throw off ballistics

05:33.460 --> 05:35.490
以防万一你不只是
just in case you're not,

05:35.500 --> 05:38.760
用它来打罐头
you know, shooting at tin cans.

05:38.960 --> 05:43.960
我的猎物可比这大多了
No, I'm hunting bigger game than that.

06:23.030 --> 06:24.420
没有任何消息
Radio silence.

06:26.430 --> 06:28.020
我只是不知道
Look, I just don't know

他多少时间看一次这个
how often he checks this thing, all right?

06:29.400 --> 06:30.990
看上去他不怎么看啊!
Well, it seems not that often

06:31.000 --> 06:33.350
你已经发了三条消息了

06:33.360 --> 06:35.520

06:36.900 --> 06:38.450

06:38.460 --> 06:40.690
我们能发消息 但斯科菲尔德
Well, I can type, and Scofield can't see who's sending him the messages.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.450
真的会上钩吗?
Well, you know what,

06:42.460 --> 06:44.820
他能察觉任何很小的事物
he's gonna see whatever little rent-a-fed cops

06:44.830 --> 06:48.450
和你们给他设的陷阱
that you guys have set up whatever place you guys are gonna set up to meet him.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.020
是的
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

06:56.030 --> 06:58.290
像他这么机敏的人
Fish is not gonna peek his little white ass

06:58.300 --> 07:00.020
不会贸然现身
out from any rock that he's hiding

07:00.030 --> 07:01.550
除非有熟人出现在他面前
unless he sees a failiar face.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.390
一个... 那人就是你吧?
A famili... and that's your face, right?

Do we? So I am gonna hold up my end of the bargain,

可以最终将这个东西
that's finally gonna put this stuff

08:30.330 --> 08:31.520
抛之于我们脑后
behind us.

08:31.530 --> 08:33.650

08:54.830 --> 08:56.320
我....我猜...
I... I guess...

08:56.330 --> 09:00.120

但是我也需要你的帮助
But I'm gonna need your help, too,

23:29.530 --> 23:32.320
有些事你不准备做，我也不想你去做
and this is something that you're not gonna want to do and I don't want you to do this,

23:32.330 --> 23:34.420
但是我需要你做这个
but I need you to do this

我会毁了他们-- 不要让我这样做
I will ruin their lives-- don't make me.

不过如果你不介意中途在
Unless you don't mind taking

29:18.760 --> 29:22.320
芝加哥和另一个国际机场转机的话 我们还有一些空位
a few connections through Chicago, and there's one more international stop.

29:22.330 --> 29:23.490
哪个越早起飞 我就要哪个

先生 我来帮你拖运这个行李
I'll check this bag for you, sir.

29:38.460 --> 29:41.990

Oh, no, that's coming with me. Give it back.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.690
先生 这个行李对于随机携带已经超重了
Sir, I know that bag is way over the weight limit for carry-on.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.590
不管是存放在飞机的货舱里还是飞机上
What difference does a few extra pounds make on a three-ton aircraft,

29:47.600 --> 29:50.520
这小小的几磅对一个三吨重的飞机来说算得了什么
whether that's up above or underneath?

29:50.530 --> 29:53.330
这违反了联邦航空局的规定
It's an faa violation.

29:53.830 --> 29:56.330
先生 你的行李保证不会有问题或损坏
Sir, your bag will be safe.

30:05.730 --> 30:09.090
今天 这个多风的城市对旅游者来说
Today will be a tough day for travelers

30:09.100 --> 30:12.490
可能会不太顺利 为了迎接莱娜斯总统
in the windy city as all streets

30:12.500 --> 30:15.150
只要在西博恩酒店六条街 半径之内的每一条街
In a six-block radius of the seaburn hotel

30:15.160 --> 30:17.490
都会被关闭
have been closed to traffic

30:17.500 --> 30:20.650
莱娜斯总统今晚将会在西博恩酒店做出演讲
in Anticipation of president Reynolds's speech there this evening.

30:20.660 --> 30:27.520
这是莱娜斯在中西部加强 她竞选总统的其中一个站点
This'll be one of several midwestern stops for the president

30:27.530 --> 30:28.990
听着 狄欧 我知道你是新来的
Hey, Theo, i know you're new

30:29.000 --> 30:31.920
但是在这里记事本我们两面都用的 知道吗？
but we use both sides of legal pads in this office, okay?

30:31.930 --> 30:34.250
除了循环之外 我们还得节省
Before we recycle, we reduce.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.420
如果克曼奇族能把整头水牛的每一处都用上
The comanche used the entire buffalo.

30:36.430 --> 30:37.820
那我们也行
So can we.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.390
其实呢 大部分的克曼奇族都会
Actually, a majority of tribes would farm land till

30:39.400 --> 30:41.450
耕田种植直到农场不能用为止
it was stripped of its utility,

30:41.460 --> 30:42.690
然后他们将会离开(即他们不会循环的意思)
then they'd just...move on.

30:42.700 --> 30:45.320
印第安人保护自然的想法
conservationist is a myth

30:45.330 --> 30:48.650
是这些白人因为罪恶感 编出来的谎言
created by white liberal guilt.

30:48.660 --> 30:51.190
保罗
Paul.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.390
好啊 克里斯丁
Hi, Kristine.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.620
我本来希望
I'd hoped

30:53.630 --> 30:54.920
能在爸爸的葬礼上看到你的
maybe I'd see you at dad's funeral.

30:54.930 --> 30:58.220
那个男人在心跳停止前已经死了
That man died long before his heart stopped.

30:58.230 --> 30:59.390
那个葬礼只是一个仪式
That funeral was a formality.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.590
那样说是不公平的
That's really not fair.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.550
这是事实
It's true.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.550
那....
So...

31:02.560 --> 31:04.250
你想知道妈妈现在如何吗？
you want to know how mom is?

31:04.260 --> 31:06.820
就算她把我从肚子里生出来
Just 'cause someone spits you out of your crotch

31:06.830 --> 31:07.920
这并不代表她有资格做我的母亲
doesn't make them your mother.

31:07.930 --> 31:09.750
那女人是个疯子
That woman is insane.

31:09.760 --> 31:10.790
你还记得吗？
Do you remember?

31:10.800 --> 31:12.450
你都忘记了吗？
Have you suppressed it all?

31:12.460 --> 31:14.390
我知道 保罗 不像你
I know, Paul.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.420
我每天都曾经历
I was there every day...unlike you.

31:15.430 --> 31:16.990
我熬了十八年
I was there for 18 years.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.420
但是你离开了
Then you just left.

31:18.430 --> 31:20.450
那时我才十岁 保罗
I was ten, Paul.

31:20.460 --> 31:23.090
你是我这世界上的唯一剩下的亲人 可是...
You were all I had in the world, and...

31:23.100 --> 31:25.800
你就把我丢在那儿
you just left me there.

31:26.860 --> 31:30.000
对不起
I'm sorry.

31:30.830 --> 31:33.120
如果可以话 我愿意把你一起带着
If I could have taken you with me, I would have,

31:33.130 --> 31:36.200
我每天都挂念着你
and I've thought about you every day.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.320
不再是你记忆中的那个哥哥
I'm not the brother you remember.

31:47.330 --> 31:49.320
我变了...
I've changed...

31:49.330 --> 31:52.150
走进了...
in A...

31:52.160 --> 31:54.320
一个不归途
really bad way.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.730
呃...
Uh...

31:56.830 --> 31:58.720
到一个连我自己都分不清
to the point where I don't know

31:58.730 --> 32:00.890
好或坏的地步
what good or bad is anymore,

32:00.900 --> 32:02.950
我要去解决一件事.
and I am going to do something--

32:02.960 --> 32:07.590
我必须解决那件事...但是这件事会让很多人
I have to do something...

32:07.600 --> 32:09.550
感觉到极度可恨的 保罗
that a lot of people are going to think is horrible.  Paul.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.490
我只要你记着
And you just remember...

32:12.500 --> 32:15.350
和你一起长大的哥哥
the brother you grew up with.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.860
你只要记得他就行了
You just remember him.

32:20.200 --> 32:25.730
你是我的妹妹 克里斯丁 我会永远爱着你
You're my sister You're my sister

32:29.930 --> 32:33.320
我被打晕了
I was out cold.

32:33.330 --> 32:34.990
我不知道我们去哪了
I don't know where they went.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.420
那把你叫到芝加哥中心
And it was their idea for you to meet them here

32:36.430 --> 32:38.350
见面的也是他们？
in the middle of Chicago?

32:38.360 --> 32:41.760
嗯
Yeah.

32:44.430 --> 32:48.260
我的天哪
oh, man.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.790
马宏
Mahone.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.760
他们已经走了
You brought me in too late They're gone.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.290
那就把他们找出来
then find them.

33:00.300 --> 33:01.650
让我把这件事搞清楚
Let me get this straight.

33:01.660 --> 33:02.990
这兄弟俩回到了一个
The brothers come back to a city that's 15 miles

33:03.000 --> 33:04.720
离福克斯河不到十五个英里的城市
from the prison they escaped from.

33:04.730 --> 33:06.190
他们为了什么要这样做呢?
Why would they do that?

33:06.200 --> 33:07.920
有可能是因为总统要在芝加哥
Maybe it's because the president is

33:07.930 --> 33:09.890
发表演讲 他们说不定有什么计划
in Chicago to make a speech, and they're up to something

33:09.900 --> 33:11.690
这更是另一个我们要找到 他们的原因
which is why we need to find them

33:11.700 --> 33:14.550
在所有人之中他们为什么偏偏要见
And of all people, they want to meet with somebody

33:14.560 --> 33:16.520
律政署里的人呢？
from the attorney general's office?

33:16.530 --> 33:18.220
你想说什么？
Your point?

33:18.230 --> 33:20.220
布伦斯是无辜的
Burrows is innocent.

33:20.230 --> 33:22.550
哇 你真的很厉害 亚历山大
Wow, you're good, Alex.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.850
就跟广告上说的一样
As advertised.

33:25.860 --> 33:27.950
没有人是真正无辜的
No one's truly innocent.

33:27.960 --> 33:31.400
所有人里面 你应该最清楚
You of all people should know that.

33:35.330 --> 33:37.220
肯定是那个接待员
it must have been the receptionist.

33:37.230 --> 33:39.930
她是唯一一个和我对过话的人
She's the only one I spoke to.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.930
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德 库泊 格林
Michael Scofield. Cooper Green.

34:52.060 --> 34:55.250
我们一定要在小孩长大之前
We got to get as much of that in

34:55.260 --> 34:56.550
抓紧时间多做一点 好好享受
as possible before the baby gets here.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.050
为什么
0Why?

34:58.060 --> 35:01.590
因为一旦小孩开始慢慢长大了
Because, once the baby's growing in there,

35:01.600 --> 35:04.390
在做的话就感觉有点不对了
doesn't it just get kind of wrong?

35:04.400 --> 35:07.160
也是啊
Oh, yeah.

35:10.430 --> 35:12.320
哇 怎么了？
- Whoa. - What?

35:12.330 --> 35:13.550
我刚刚感觉到小孩在动了
I just felt the baby move.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.490
费尔南多 那是不可能的 那简直太早了...
Fernando, that's impossible-- it's a little too early...

35:15.500 --> 35:16.920
我绝对感觉到了
I know what I just felt.

35:16.930 --> 35:21.190
医生的确有说过  在某种活动之后
Well, the doctor did say that

35:21.200 --> 35:24.200
小孩有可能会开始动
he can become active after certain activities.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.490
哇！你感觉到了没有？
Whoa!Did you feel that?

35:29.500 --> 35:30.920
嗯,有点微动 什么微动
Yeah, like a flutter. Flutter my ass.

35:30.930 --> 35:32.120
他好健壮
He's strong.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.720
他将会是国家足球队的队长
He's going to be the captain of the national soccer team.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.120
你听到了 宝贝？
You hear that, junior?

35:37.130 --> 35:38.390
只要一你出世...
As soon as you're born,

35:38.400 --> 35:40.690
我就要把足球放到你手里
I' putting a soccer ball in your hands.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.820
不 他将会拿起书本
No, he's going to have books.

35:42.830 --> 35:47.400
那好 有关足球的书籍
Fine. Books about soccer.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.820
看吧 宝贝
See, baby.

35:51.830 --> 35:54.220
我和你说一切都会没事的
I told you everything was going to work out.

35:54.230 --> 35:57.120
我们在一个别人都找不到地方
We're out in the middle of nowhere,

35:57.130 --> 35:59.320
小孩也很好
baby's doing great.

35:59.330 --> 36:02.990
一切都会变得很完美
Everything's going to be perfect.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.090
看起来前面是一片晴空
Well, it looks like we've got nothing but smooth skies ahead,

36:06.100 --> 36:07.490
我们应该会准时
so we should be arriving in Mexico right on time.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.590
抵达墨西哥 不好意思
Excuse me.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.550
餐食什么时候才会送来？我都饿死了
When's the meal coming around? I'm starved.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.420
为了降低票价
As a way to keep ticket prices low,

36:14.430 --> 36:17.720
正餐已经不再列入我们的服务套餐当中
we have removed the in-flight meal frm our service package.

36:17.730 --> 36:20.350
服务套餐里面还剩下什么?
What's left on the service package?

36:20.360 --> 36:23.520
椒盐卷饼和一些零食
retzels and bags of krispity krunch.

36:23.530 --> 36:24.850
要椒盐卷饼
Pretzels.

36:24.860 --> 36:28.430
稍等片刻
Just a few minutes

36:31.330 --> 36:34.250

因为有你在  她就会好起来的
She's going to be okay because of you.

37:10.800 --> 37:14.990
我当然原谅你的  我明白的
I know that. Of course I forgive you.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.490
你不知道在迪迪四岁的时候
You know when Dede was like four,

37:17.500 --> 37:19.390
有一次她想看电视
she wanted to watch this video.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.850
我跟她不耐烦地说
And I kept telling her you know,

37:20.860 --> 37:21.950
等我看完比赛
"after the game,

37:21.960 --> 37:23.350
等我看完比赛  好么?
after the game, okay?”

37:23.360 --> 37:25.890
她就一直不断的问啊问
She kept asking and kept asking,

37:25.900 --> 37:28.750
后来我实在不耐烦了  训斥了她几句
and I lost my patience and I snapped at her.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.420
很不耐烦的训斥
I snapped at her real bad.

37:30.430 --> 37:34.500
她躲到角落里...
She went over into the corner, and...

37:35.300 --> 37:37.950
我都没有过去安慰她
I didn't even go over and say anything.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.720
你为何这样耿耿于怀
Why are you getting yourself upset over

37:39.730 --> 37:41.190
这事都过去好几年了
something that happened years ago, baby?

37:41.200 --> 37:44.490
- 迪迪爱你的- 亲爱的  听我说
Dede loves you.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.720

37:49.260 --> 37:50.990

37:51.000 --> 37:53.190
我的宝贝女儿对我来说
And that my baby girls

37:53.200 --> 37:55.350
她就是我的一切  告诉她
means everything to me

37:55.360 --> 37:57.090
她就是我的一切  好吗?
I want you to tell her that she means everything to me, okay?

37:57.100 --> 37:58.490

-Time.- No matter what...

38:00.360 --> 38:01.520

38:11.030 --> 38:12.050
女士

你真的必须走了
You really have to go.

38:13.700 --> 38:16.860

Tell her, tell her.

38:16.930 --> 38:20.100
好的
Ok

38:32.260 --> 38:35.150
请注意
Attentn, attention.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.350
所有参观者必须站在护栏之外
All spectators must remain behind the barricades

38:37.360 --> 38:38.790
随时保持秩序
at all times.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.490
总统将马上抵达
The president will be arriving shortly.

38:41.500 --> 38:45.200
任何人企图穿越护栏将...
Anyone attempting to circumvent the barricades...

38:47.100 --> 38:49.390
半个街区以南发现一名爆炸犯
whoa..Got a boom charlie half block south.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.550
队长叫你马上过去
Team leader wants you there right now.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.620
什么型号的?
What's the M.O.?

38:51.630 --> 38:54.600
简易炸弹绑在了他的...
He's got an tied strapped to...

38:59.060 --> 39:02.350
他特地要你来这个喷泉处
he asked you to come to this fountainpecifically?

39:02.360 --> 39:05.000
是
Yeah.

39:06.500 --> 39:10.630
我看一下公园地图
Let me take a look at that park map.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.090
为什么不是公园东边的喷泉处
Why not the fountain on the east side of the park?

39:14.100 --> 39:17.090
这边离电话亭最近
ecause this one's closer to the pay phone he called me on.

39:17.100 --> 39:19.620
不  是因为这里离他们最近
No, because this one's closer to them.

39:19.630 --> 39:21.590
他们告诉你在雕塑那边见
They tell you to meet them at the statue.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.890
然后是喷泉
Then the fountain.

39:22.900 --> 39:24.750
然后把你带入那座楼
Then they send you to the building

39:24.760 --> 39:26.890
公园的对面
across the park.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.750
为什么
Why?

39:29.760 --> 39:32.090
他们把你放在视线范围之内
'Cause they want to keep you in their sights.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.490
是为了观察你的行踪
Because they're watching you.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.850
但是从哪里?
But from where?

39:36.860 --> 39:40.130
雕塑  喷泉  楼房...
Statue, fountain, building...

39:42.160 --> 39:43.350
在那
there.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.700
那个酒店
the hotel

39:47.300 --> 39:49.390
你清楚拿到了什么
You know what you have?

39:49.400 --> 39:51.150
我想我们很明白
I think we have a pretty good idea.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.850
你在干什么
What you doing?

39:52.860 --> 39:54.550
从这个U盘里提取特殊数据
Getting all unique data from the memory key

39:54.560 --> 39:55.850
这样我们可以鉴别它的唯一性
so we can identify this key from any other--

39:55.860 --> 40:00.720
然后开始记录下里面的保存信息
label it, start a proper record of a chain of

40:00.730 --> 40:03.530
再把这些交给我信任的法官
custody to present to the judges I trust.

40:06.900 --> 40:09.090
不
no.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.050
怎么了?
What's wrong?

40:11.060 --> 40:13.220
记忆库的时间不对
No, it's the date stamp on the memory key.

40:13.230 --> 40:15.420
这是复制的数据
It's the copy date.

40:15.430 --> 40:16.590
我没听清  这是什么?
I'm sorry, what's that?

40:16.600 --> 40:18.050
日期是这鬼东西被复制的时间
It's the date the damn thing was copied,

40:18.060 --> 40:19.250
而不是
not the date

40:19.260 --> 40:21.390
谈话的原始日期
that the conversation was originally recorded.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.450
那又怎么样
So what?

40:22.460 --> 40:24.650
你已经听过了这录音的内容
I mean, you heard what was on the tape.

40:24.660 --> 40:28.190
没有确凿的时间标注
Without a time stamp of exactly

40:28.200 --> 40:30.250
关于这段谈话
when this conversation took place,

40:30.260 --> 40:32.320
我们无法确认斯蒂德曼
we can't prove that this is Terrence Steadman talking

40:32.330 --> 40:34.750
是在你被指控谋杀之前所录下的
after you supposedly killed him.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.150
因为这可以被认作是
This could have happened a year

40:36.160 --> 40:38.220
他葬礼一年之后的录音
before his funeral.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.550
因为这无法鉴别
No, it can't be authenticated,

40:40.560 --> 40:43.090
所以不能成为呈堂证供
so it can't be admitted to any court as evidence.

40:43.100 --> 40:44.720
人们为了它而死
People died because of this.

40:44.730 --> 40:46.320
我的家人
My family died.

40:46.330 --> 40:49.060
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

40:50.200 --> 40:54.100
从法律上来讲  这段录音没有任何意义
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

40:59.660 --> 41:00.920
亚历山大马宏FBI
Alexander Mahone, FBI.

41:00.930 --> 41:04.850
这两个人有没有来过?
Have either of these men checked in?

41:04.860 --> 41:06.220
我没见过他们
No, not that i've seen.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.700
这名女士呢?
What about this woman?

41:08.930 --> 41:12.260
恩
Yeah.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.150
10-06房间
Room 10-06.

41:14.160 --> 41:15.000
10-06  谢谢
10-06,Thank you.

41:20.530 --> 41:21.000
这不是结束
It's not over.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.520
- 我们就差一步  - 你说过都没问题的
We're this close.

41:22.630 --> 41:24.020
我说了这没办法使你们
You already said it's done.

41:24.230 --> 41:29.390
在法庭上洗脱罪名
Actually, I said it couldn't help exonerate you in a court of law.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.290
不过在法律之外  它会对你们有利的
Maybe it can help you outside the law.

41:31.300 --> 41:33.390
如何?
How?

41:33.400 --> 41:35.420
我们都听了这段谈话
Well, we all heard the conversation.

41:35.430 --> 41:38.320
证明林肯清白的潜在的证据
There's more to this tape than

41:38.330 --> 41:39.720
可能比录音本身更重要
poential proof of Lincoln's innocence.

41:39.730 --> 41:42.490
