《越狱》前情回顾
Previously onPrison Break

00:03.970 --> 00:05.010
关于那个人
There's something about this guy.

00:05.010 --> 00:06.210
他似乎知道
It's like he knows where

00:06.210 --> 00:08.280
我们要去哪里和我们在想什么 如果是真的话
we're going and what we're thinking. If that's true,

00:08.280 --> 00:11.850
不久他就能发现在犹他的钱...
it's just a matter of time before he finds out about the money in Utah

00:11.850 --> 00:13.880
我们怎么去墨西哥...
our way into Mexico...

00:13.880 --> 00:15.310
所有事
Everything.

00:20.850 --> 00:21.880
...会有律师
...have an attorney present

00:21.880 --> 00:23.250
出现在现在或者将来质询过程中
during questioning now or in the future...

00:23.250 --> 00:24.850
凯若琳 他们正带她进去
Caroline,they're taking her in.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.750
当然  我会看着她
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

00:26.750 --> 00:28.680
你确实做了 爸爸
You did it,Dad.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.250
像我说的那样做
Just do as you're told.

00:30.250 --> 00:32.810
不然结果会
Otherwise there will be consequences

00:32.810 --> 00:34.250
牵涉到我们两个人
that will affect us all.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.980
我爸是空军上校
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

00:35.980 --> 00:40.110
当我告诉他我和一个男孩子在一个旅馆里
When I told him I was staying in a hotel with a guy that I

00:40.110 --> 00:41.780
而且是一个我有点喜欢的男孩子
maybe sorta liked,

00:41.780 --> 00:43.910
他勃然大怒了
he lost it.

00:43.910 --> 00:46.410
你在这里干什么? 玛丽克鲁兹在哪儿?
What are you doing here? Where's Maricruz?

00:46.410 --> 00:47.580
她现在和我在一起了
She's with me now.

00:47.580 --> 00:48.910
告诉我她在哪儿
Don't push it.

00:48.910 --> 00:51.050
嘿  费尔南多  慢点
Hey,Fernando,slow down,man.

00:51.050 --> 00:55.300
我刚才正想告诉你  婚礼在拉斯维加斯举行
I was trying to tell you,the wedding is in Vegas.

00:55.310 --> 00:57.180
这会是谁?
Which one of them was it?

00:57.180 --> 00:58.210
可能是斯科菲尔德
Might be Scofield.

00:58.210 --> 00:59.310
我们还可能
Probably gonna find

00:59.310 --> 01:02.200
在这里找到他哥哥的尸体
his brother in there,too.

01:02.210 --> 01:03.180
去哪儿 先生?
Where to,sir?

01:03.180 --> 01:05.510
犹他
Utah.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.750
今天早上伊利诺斯州有关部门
This morning,authorities in Illinois

01:15.750 --> 01:17.950
发布了关于越狱最新情况
issued an update on the escaped convicts

01:17.950 --> 01:20.580
到现在为止  从福克斯河越狱的八个人中
known until now as the Fox River Eight

01:20.580 --> 01:22.550
芝加哥黑帮老大约翰 阿布鲁奇
Chicago mob boss John Abruzzi

01:22.550 --> 01:26.950
昨晚在华盛顿一家汽车旅馆外被击毙
was gunned down outside a Washington D.C. motel last night

01:26.950 --> 01:28.910
是由于调查人员获得了线人的消息
after investigators received a tip from an informant.

01:28.910 --> 01:30.080
其余七人仍旧在逃
The other seven escapees

01:30.080 --> 01:32.750
依然极度危险
are still at large and considered dangerous.

01:36.550 --> 01:39.350
我没想到阿布鲁奇会是第一个
I didn't think Abruzzi'd be the first to go.

01:39.350 --> 01:42.180
我觉得一定还会有很多意外的事情
I have a feeling we're in for lots of surprises.

01:42.180 --> 01:44.380
他们说我们还有七个人
They said seven are still out there.

01:44.380 --> 01:45.880
看来我们伪造死亡被识破了
So much for faking our deaths.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.550
我们赢得了一些时间  所以还是有价值的
I bought us some time-- that's what counts.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.120
还有多远?
How much further?

01:53.120 --> 01:54.480
七八十英里
70,80 miles.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.480
好的 我们下午就能到KK农场了
Good. Means we should be hitting the Double K Ranch by this afternoon. Or we can keep driving,

01:56.480 --> 01:58.580
我们可以接上LJ
pick up LJ

01:58.580 --> 01:59.920
然后一直开到巴拿马
and hit Panama.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.080
我们不能去巴拿马
We can't hit Panama!

02:01.080 --> 02:03.450
我们哪儿都不能去  什么都不能做
We can't hit anything! We can't do anything

02:03.450 --> 02:04.450
在没有钱的情况下
without the money.

02:04.450 --> 02:06.390
我们要找到查尔斯藏钱的地方
We need to find Charles's stash.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.730
我知道其他人也在想着这事
I know some other guys who are thinking the same thing.

02:13.480 --> 02:19.620
钱就埋在KK农场的一个地窖里
The money is buried under a silo at the Double K Ranch

02:19.620 --> 02:23.550
就在犹他州的图勒镇外
just outside of Tooele,Utah.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.210
查票
Tickets?

02:43.350 --> 02:45.650
哦  在夏延的时候
Oh. Um,you know,when I was in Cheyenne,

02:45.650 --> 02:47.820
我从口袋里把票拿出来的时候
I pulled my ticket out of the bag.

02:47.820 --> 02:49.650
把它撕成了两半...
It tore in half,and...

02:49.650 --> 02:51.750
我不知道另一半哪儿去了
I have no idea what happened to the other part.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.980
他们没有补给你一张新的?
They didn't issue you a replacement?

02:53.980 --> 02:57.080
没有啊 那位小姐  好像叫雪莉
No. The young lady-- I think-- her name was Sherry--

02:57.080 --> 02:58.980
说剩下这半张也能用
she actually said that this half is okay

02:58.980 --> 03:00.520
因为上面的条形码还在
because the bar code is on it.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.620
但是你确实是需要一张完整的票
Well,you really need the whole ticket.

03:02.620 --> 03:05.550
我当时就是想要避免这样的情况
This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.

03:05.550 --> 03:08.150
但是她说  没问题的...
She said that everything would be fine because...

03:08.150 --> 03:09.350
好吧  现在算了
That's okay. It'll do for now.

03:09.350 --> 03:11.480
不过你务必要换一张新的
But make sure you ask for a replacement

03:11.480 --> 03:12.480
当你到了普罗沃后
when you get to Provo.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.930
我一定会的  谢谢
I definitely will. Thank you.

03:15.220 --> 03:17.520
总会遇到些事情 是吧?
It's always something,huh?

03:17.520 --> 03:18.310
哦 是的 我明白
Oh,God,I know.

03:30.080 --> 03:33.820
我不想回家了

03:33.820 --> 03:35.950
我真想我们就这样一直开车走
I wish we could keep driving.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.590
我可不觉得你老爸会同意的
I don't think your Pops will be down for that.

03:40.030 --> 03:41.030
这样不是很有趣吗?
Wouldn't it be fun?

03:42.850 --> 03:44.900
我们可以去...
We could go to...

03:45.250 --> 03:46.510
夏威夷?
Hawaii?

03:46.520 --> 03:47.750
哈 你不能
Yo,you can't

03:47.750 --> 03:50.570
开车去夏威夷
drive to Hawaii.

03:50.580 --> 03:51.580
我知道
I know.

03:51.580 --> 03:53.250
我只是说说
I'm just saying

03:53.250 --> 03:54.260
我希望
I wish.

03:56.180 --> 03:58.120
呃
Whoa,whoa.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.020
不...不要去开 他们会走的
No,no. Don't get it. They'll leave.

04:00.020 --> 04:01.490
我只是看看是谁
Just let me see who it is

04:07.750 --> 04:08.750
是个警察
It's a cop.

04:09.140 --> 04:11.080
不 不 不 不 不
No,no,no,no,no. Whoa,whoa,whoa.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.120
很抱歉打扰你  小姐
Sorry to disturb you,ma'am.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.560
你有没有见过这个人?
Have you happened to see this person?

04:54.760 --> 04:56.250
昨天晚上我们收到线索
Last night we got a few phone calls

04:56.250 --> 04:57.790
说他在这附近出现
that he was spotted in the area.

04:57.790 --> 04:59.490
所以我们在挨家挨户地调查
So we're going door-to-door.

05:00.870 --> 05:01.880
你们为什么要找他?
Why are you looking for him?

05:02.250 --> 05:03.840
他一两天前
He escaped from prison in Illinois

05:03.850 --> 05:05.010
从伊利诺斯州一所监狱越狱
a couple of days ago.

05:05.010 --> 05:06.280
你有没有见过他?
And you see him?

05:11.900 --> 05:12.570
没有
No.

05:13.470 --> 05:14.700
没见过
He doesn't look familiar.

05:15.860 --> 05:16.590
你确定?
Are you sure?

05:18.590 --> 05:19.490
是的  我确定
Yeah. I'm sure.

05:22.880 --> 05:23.390
好吧
All right.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.480
谢谢 打扰你了
Thanks for your time.

05:30.750 --> 05:31.970
呃
Whoa.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.390
嘿 嘿
Whoa,whoa,whoa.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.250
这不是...
This ain't...

05:34.250 --> 05:36.180
不是你想的那样 好吗?
This is not what you think,all right?

05:36.180 --> 05:37.000
嘿
Look.

05:37.910 --> 05:38.740
听我说 这...
Listen to me,this...

05:39.250 --> 05:40.420
听...我说
Just... listen.

05:41.240 --> 05:41.900
好吗?
Okay?

05:42.640 --> 05:43.550
我仅仅只是
All I did

05:43.550 --> 05:45.320
偷了一张棒球卡
was steal a baseball card.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.150
好吗? 我并不像那儿的其他人
Okay? I'm not like those other fools up in there.

05:50.730 --> 05:53.010
我现在想去散个步 难道不行么?
I'm gonna go for a walk,okay?

05:54.480 --> 05:55.910
听着... 我会把我的钥匙留这儿
Listen... I'm gonna leave my keys right here.

05:57.330 --> 05:58.480
等到我回来的时候
And when I come back,

05:59.420 --> 06:00.470
我的车子自然会不见
my car will be gone.

06:01.890 --> 06:02.530
我想
I'm sure,

06:03.190 --> 06:03.960
几个小时后
in a few hours,

06:04.810 --> 06:05.870
警察会在某个地方找到它的...
they'll find it somewhere...

06:07.440 --> 06:08.240
被扔在了路边
abandoned.

06:14.110 --> 06:15.200
等等  等等
Wait. Wait.

06:22.110 --> 06:23.400
我也不希望我现在这样子
I wish it could be different.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.760
我得走了
I have to go.

06:46.930 --> 06:47.520
这就是图雷
"Too-le."

06:48.190 --> 06:49.410
我想应该是图勒镇
I think it's "To-ill-uh."

06:50.170 --> 06:50.910
这么个小镇
Hell of a town.

06:51.650 --> 06:52.710
小点好
Small is good.

06:52.710 --> 06:54.510
那个农场找起来就容易点
Means the ranch'll be easier to find.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.610
我们要做的就是拿到钱
All we got to do is get that money

06:57.920 --> 06:59.160
然后在日落前离开
and we'll be out of here by nightfall.

06:59.630 --> 07:00.370
对
Right.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.710
哦 长官 斯科菲尔德的车祸化验报告出来了
Oh,sir. Soil test came back from Scofield's crash.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.250
不用进一步的证明
Not that you need any more proof,but...

07:26.250 --> 07:28.150
他现在还逍遥法外
he really went out of his way this time.

07:28.150 --> 07:30.180
还有什么消息?
What else do you have?

07:30.180 --> 07:32.210
内布拉斯加州有人被暴力攻击
Man was violently assaulted in Nebraska

07:32.210 --> 07:34.550
根据搭车旅行者的描述 像是帝博格干的
by a hitchhiker matching Bagwell's description.

07:34.550 --> 07:36.010
他正在沿着80州际公路往西逃
He was headed west on the I-80.

07:36.010 --> 07:38.110
俄马哈把照片排好了
Omaha's putting together a photo lineup.

07:38.490 --> 07:39.600
有什么关于斯科菲尔德的?
What do you have on Scofield?

07:40.650 --> 07:41.470
其他人有没有
What does anybody

07:41.470 --> 07:42.660
关于斯科菲尔德的消息?
have on Scofield?

07:44.110 --> 07:45.710
嗯 我从他的硬盘里
Uh,I've got some results

07:45.710 --> 07:46.980
得到了些信息
from his hard drive.

07:46.980 --> 07:49.310
就是从河里打捞上来的那个硬盘
The one recovered from the river.

07:50.700 --> 07:51.420
我们可以运用
We were able to use

07:51.430 --> 07:53.290
扇形编辑器去恢复主要信息
the sector editor to restore the master boot.

07:53.620 --> 07:54.220
然后...
So from that...

07:54.220 --> 07:55.460
我不管你怎么做的
I don't care how you did it.

07:55.470 --> 07:56.200
你找到了什么?
What do you have?

07:58.810 --> 08:00.510
超过一半的缓冲容量
More than half the contents of the buffer.

08:00.510 --> 08:01.760
接近百分之60
About 60%.

08:08.370 --> 08:09.320
但分布都很零散
It looks pretty random.

08:09.330 --> 08:11.620
全部打印出来  放到我桌子上
Print it up. All of it. I want it on my desk.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.650
呃  你猜怎么着?
Well,guess what?

08:18.460 --> 08:20.220
列表上没有KK农场
No listing for a Double K Ranch.

08:21.260 --> 08:21.950
请问
Excuse me.

08:22.290 --> 08:23.750
你知道KK农场在哪儿吗?
You know where I might find a Double K Ranch?

08:23.760 --> 08:25.010
什么?
What you call it?

08:25.400 --> 08:26.690
KK农场
Double K Ranch.

08:26.690 --> 08:27.510
不知道
No.

08:28.090 --> 08:28.950
你是这一带的人么?
You from around here?

08:28.950 --> 08:30.460
是的  从小到大一直在这
Yeah. Born and raised.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.210
没有什么KK什么农场
There's no Double-nothin'.

08:32.630 --> 08:33.700
好了  谢谢
Great. Thank you.

08:36.470 --> 08:37.330
看来韦斯特莫兰德在临死前
Looks like Westmoreland

08:37.340 --> 08:39.610
耍了你一通
spent his last breath blowing smoke up your ass.

08:39.610 --> 08:41.080
还有个方法
There's one way to find out.

08:41.540 --> 08:43.240
这个县一定会保存有财产记录
The county keeps property records.

08:44.010 --> 08:45.650
上面会用标尺标明所有地点
Every plot is mapped out

08:45.650 --> 08:47.350
是公共档案
with dimensions. It's public record.

08:47.970 --> 08:50.560
如果这里有财税办公室的话
But if there is a tax assessor's office here,

08:51.910 --> 08:55.380
那一定是在这里 市政大楼
it's gonna be in there,the Municipal Building.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.540
那里有警察巡逻的

09:03.730 --> 09:04.420
快讯

09:04.730 --> 09:07.760
有人...有人今天早上偷走了我的车
Someone...someone stole my car this morning.

我在莲花汽车旅馆  80州际公路上
I'm at the Lotus Motel off Interstate 80

09:10.060 --> 09:11.360
你有没有看到是谁偷走的?
Did you see who took it?

09:11.680 --> 09:13.740
没有  我出去散步了
No. I went out for a walk

09:13.750 --> 09:15.820

09:15.820 --> 09:16.470
今天早上?

09:16.930 --> 09:17.930
为什么之前不打电话来?
Why didn't you call before?

09:17.930 --> 09:19.920
我... 我也不知道
I... I don't know.

09:54.850 --> 09:57.090
哈罗!

10:12.720 --> 10:15.290
芝加哥伊利诺州

10:18.080 --> 10:19.180
克里曼先生
Mr. Kellerman.

10:19.190 --> 10:20.100

能在芝加哥见到你 真是巧啊
Surprised to see you in Chicago.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.170
只是来看下进展
Just looking for updates.

10:26.170 --> 10:27.620
唐克雷蒂 莎拉  我正在处理
Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.560
你就花了你所有的时间去追查她?
Is pursuing her the best use of your time?

10:30.560 --> 10:31.510
没错
It is.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.330
她和斯科菲尔德还有联系
She's in contact with Scofield.

10:33.340 --> 10:34.870
昨天他们通电话的时候我就在旁边
I was there when he called yesterday.

10:35.740 --> 10:37.430
我们有了她  就能找到斯科菲尔德
We stay with her,she takes us right to him,

10:37.920 --> 10:39.010
找到斯科菲尔德  就找到布伦斯
he takes us to Burrows.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.300
得了
All right.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.120
既然你那么自信
If you're that confident.

10:43.430 --> 10:44.070

10:46.080 --> 10:47.090
我会告诉总统

10:54.170 --> 10:54.980

如果你要找回你的尊严
If you want to restore your dignity,

11:23.630 --> 11:25.160
你就必须做出行动
you need to take action.

11:25.160 --> 11:29.760
痛改前非不仅仅是说句对不起就行了
Making amends requires much more than saying "I'm sorry."

11:29.760 --> 11:32.290
你需要学着改变自己
It means learning to change.

11:32.290 --> 11:35.060
道歉只是第一步
The apology is just the first step.

11:35.060 --> 11:38.700
最重要的是在你道歉的时候
The most important thing is that you display honesty,

11:38.700 --> 11:41.300
你必须诚实
courage and compassion

11:41.300 --> 11:43.770
要有勇气和同情心
when you extend your apologies.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.700
你要做的就是去赢得别人的原谅
You need to earn your forgiveness.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.650

We'll talk about it more on Friday.

12:03.610 --> 12:04.880

I've got a great idea.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.510
怎么说?
What's that?

12:06.510 --> 12:08.050
既然你那么喜欢
Since you are such a fan

12:08.050 --> 12:10.750
外面买的蓝莓派
of lame,store-bought blueberry pie,

12:10.750 --> 12:14.320
我打算今晚亲自做个你喜欢的给你
I am going to bake you a real pie of your choice tonight.

12:17.010 --> 12:20.000
不用了
I can't.

12:20.010 --> 12:22.350
现在除了我的医生外
I really don't need to be seeing anyone right now

12:22.350 --> 12:23.820
我真的不想见任何人
who isn't my therapist.

12:25.310 --> 12:27.460
我最近也像个隐居者
I've been a hermit lately,too.

12:28.980 --> 12:30.850
我的搭档丹尼尔外出谈生意去了
My partner Daniel's away on business.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.080
每晚我都独自一人
I've been sitting around every night by myself.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.050
有点可怜啊
Kind of pathetic.

12:36.510 --> 12:38.020
真的很抱歉
I am so sorry.

12:38.030 --> 12:39.210
我以为你是说...
I thought you meant...

12:39.210 --> 12:41.250
啊...
Um...

12:41.250 --> 12:42.950
我以为...
I thought...

12:42.950 --> 12:44.910
派...
The-The pie...

12:44.910 --> 12:48.490
哦！
Oh,no.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.150
我太自以为是  不 我就是在讲蓝莓派
That's my ego. No,I was really talking about...

12:50.150 --> 12:51.310
是的
Pie? Yeah.

12:51.310 --> 12:52.980
真正的蓝莓 我们可以自己动手做派
Actual blueberries. Like we'd make pie and watch

12:52.980 --> 12:55.180
看《油炸绿番茄》(电视节目)   我明白
Fried Green Tomatoes.I get it,

12:55.180 --> 12:56.380
我明白
I get it.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.150
我是这个镇里最好的戒了毒的厨师
I'm the best ex-junkie cook in this town.

12:58.150 --> 13:00.650
谢谢 我得... 得回家搞搞卫生了
Thank you. I just... I-I got to clean my apartment.

13:00.650 --> 13:04.010
乱的一塌糊涂 我知道这听起来像个借口 但不是
It's disgusting,and I realize that sounds like an excuse; it's not.

13:04.010 --> 13:05.550
不不不 我明白
No,no,no,I get it.

13:05.550 --> 13:08.490
你去做该做的吧
Um... you do what you got to do.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.280
祝你有个愉快的夜晚
Have a good night.

13:13.730 --> 13:14.410
送我一程怎样？
Do you deliver?

13:24.250 --> 13:26.050
下一份材料
Next batch.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.490
放在桌上就好了
Just... put it on the desk.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.010
看出些眉目了吗?
Does any of this stuff mean anything?

14:02.010 --> 14:02.870
没 迟点再说
I don't know. Ask me later.

14:04.130 --> 14:05.600
他是个天才还是个疯子?
Think he's a genius or a whack-job?

14:05.610 --> 14:06.650
这还用问吗？
I think we answered that question

14:06.650 --> 14:08.260
我们都派了上百个探员来调查这案子了
when we assigned a hundred agents to the case.

14:08.270 --> 14:09.860
你能不能过去帮我把剩余的材料都弄好?
So why don't you go and get me the rest of it,huh?

14:09.870 --> 14:10.880
明白了没?
Does that work for you?

14:44.310 --> 14:46.460
多幸运啊
Alackaday.

14:46.850 --> 14:49.040
居然碰到了个同伴啊
I just found me an In-betweener.

14:51.380 --> 14:53.010
这么急 上哪啊?
Where you going in such a hurry,huh?

14:53.010 --> 14:54.480
关你屁事
None of your beeswax,yo.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.850

15:04.250 --> 15:06.580

If they ain't here already.

15:06.580 --> 15:09.910
镇上的人不是都说没听说过这地方吗？
Ain't no country folk in this town ever heard of the Double K Ranch.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.150
你好像被误导了
Seems like you've been misinformed.

15:11.150 --> 15:12.550
确实有个地方叫这名字
Indeedy there is a Double K.

15:12.550 --> 15:14.710
关键要看谁先到那了 是吧?
It's just a matter of who gets there first,all right?

15:14.710 --> 15:16.680
情况紧急啊 伙计
The stars are going to collide in Tooele,my friend.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.650
你会需要我帮助的
You're going to need me on your side.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.380
这儿可不是监狱 你以为呢?
This ain't Fox River,all right?

15:20.380 --> 15:21.900
我不需要任何...
I don't need any...

15:24.550 --> 15:25.810
要知道...
As you can see...

15:25.810 --> 15:28.580
我需要你
I need you.

15:29.910 --> 15:33.650
拿开你的脏手 变态老
Get your grubby paws off me,you freak.

15:33.650 --> 15:35.880

好了 有可靠消息说看到富兰克林
Okay,we've got a confirmed sighting on Franklin.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.510
在爱达荷州的普雷斯顿 从一辆运行中的火车中跳了出来
Jumped out of a moving train in Preston,Idaho.

23:30.980 --> 23:34.100
一个从芝加哥来的老黑到爱达荷来干什么?
What is a black man from Chicago doing in Idaho?

23:34.600 --> 23:35.600
他准是迷路了
He's got to be lost.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.030
富兰克林在爱达荷的普雷斯顿

两人都没渡过密西西比河
And both men have never been across the Mississippi.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.990
探亲访友?我不这么想
Visiting friends and family? I don't think so.

23:42.990 --> 23:43.750
也不是...
And not...

23:44.780 --> 23:45.600
南下去边境
south of the border.

They're due west and we need to know...

23:49.140 --> 23:49.800

23:56.670 --> 23:57.470

What's going on,friends?

23:57.480 --> 23:58.340
你刚说特纳?朝哪个方向去了?
Where did you say Tweener was headed?

23:58.830 --> 24:00.830
从大路走了 他应该是去找铲子了
Up on the main drag. He was supposed to find a shovel.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.230

Hey,you guys!Hey!

24:26.500 --> 24:28.290
拜托 我可以帮你们!
Come on,man,I'm gonna help you here!

24:40.230 --> 24:42.280
我当时正在开越野车
I was on my ATV,and I was hauling ass.

24:42.290 --> 24:44.530
我紧跟着她屁股后面 我拔枪出来
I was right on her tail,and I pulled out my gun

24:44.530 --> 24:46.430
乓!那畜牲像棵树一样倒下了
and blam! That bitch treed herself,

24:46.440 --> 24:48.150
我一枪就打中了
and I brought her down in one shot.

24:48.150 --> 24:48.870
秤分量没?
What'd she weigh?

24:48.870 --> 24:49.710
至少一百...
Least a hunny.

24:50.540 --> 24:51.370
也许十分之一
Maybe one-ten.

24:51.370 --> 24:52.720
要是你愿意下次来找我们
Come on out and see us if you want.

24:52.730 --> 24:53.720
那就有意思了
It's gonna be a good time.

24:53.730 --> 24:55.460
是啊 我应该会去的
Yeah,I just might do that.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.730
嗨,你打算挖什么?
hey,now,what you digging?

25:09.060 --> 25:11.010
在我爷爷家的院子挖点东西
Uh...some stuff in my grandpa's yard.

25:12.180 --> 25:14.020
你要是挖得深点的话我后房有把大铲子
We got a bigger one in the back if you're going deep.

25:15.270 --> 25:15.830
不用了
No,

25:15.840 --> 25:16.540
这个就可以了
this will do.

25:18.980 --> 25:20.670

Damn it if I don't know you from somewhere.

25:22.510 --> 25:23.660
也许我认识你爷爷
Maybe I know your grandpa.

25:23.670 --> 25:24.550

25:24.550 --> 25:26.760

He moved here,like,a month ago,so...

25:27.420 --> 25:28.130

What's his name?

His name's Grandpa.

25:31.640 --> 25:33.720

你不想她嫁给赫克托 是吗?是吧?
You don't want her to marry Hector,do you? Do you?

28:41.320 --> 28:41.950
问吧?
Yes?

28:43.500 --> 28:44.320
你知道我是谁么?
Do you know who I am?

28:47.960 --> 28:51.720
我昨晚碰巧看了新闻 我知道
Uh...I happened to see the news last night,yes.

28:53.990 --> 28:54.700
嗨 这没关系
Hey,I don't care.

28:54.710 --> 28:56.650
我也有不想让人知道的事
I've got some skeletons in my closet,too.

28:56.660 --> 28:58.470

One of them wears a dress.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.050

Thank you.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.270
感谢你没对我说三道四

29:03.630 --> 29:04.350
在我看来
From what I can tell,

29:04.950 --> 29:05.900
你一点也没错
you didn't do anything wrong,

29:05.900 --> 29:06.940
但这不关我事
but it's none of my business.

29:06.950 --> 29:08.020
你不用跟我说
And you don't need to talk about it.

29:09.130 --> 29:10.010
整个事情...
The whole thing just...

29:13.920 --> 29:15.010
我从来没想过会变成这样
I never meant for it to happen.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.900
好 你不用回答这个问题
Okay,you do not need to answer this question.

29:21.210 --> 29:22.080
嗯?
Hmm?

29:22.080 --> 29:24.640
但是你当时和那个家伙 好像...
But were you and that guy,like,uh...

29:29.550 --> 29:30.950

You're right,I don't want to talk about it.

30:17.860 --> 30:18.650

No,no need.

30:19.890 --> 30:20.720
马上就好
It'll only take a minute.

30:21.350 --> 30:22.450
那就来我办公室吧
Why don't you step into my office

30:22.450 --> 30:23.680
你请随意

30:23.680 --> 30:24.340

Sure.

30:33.580 --> 30:36.670

So,uh...

30:36.680 --> 30:38.840
在我的疗程里 嗯...
So,in my program,um...

30:38.840 --> 30:41.140
我们说了很多关于改过的事情
we've been talking a lot about making amends,

30:41.140 --> 30:44.890
我也想了很多关于...
and I've been thinking a lot about,um...

30:46.510 --> 30:48.210
关于一些
about some of

30:48.220 --> 30:48.940
我最近所作的选择
the choices I've made lately,

30:48.940 --> 30:51.640
我也知道那影响了你
and I know that that affects you.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.750
呃...
Um...

30:55.810 --> 30:58.080
我 我想告诉你
and I... I wanted to tell you

30:58.080 --> 30:59.180
我很抱歉
that I'm sorry.

30:59.180 --> 31:01.840
你不用道歉
You don't have to say you're sorry.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.140
不 我要道歉
Yeah,I do.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.720
很难理解
And it must be hard to understand

31:06.730 --> 31:07.490
我为什么这么做
why I did it.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.100
我当时根本不知道是我把这些人
Um,I had no idea that I was putting these guys

31:13.180 --> 31:15.030
放跑的
back out on the street.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.340
我以为我是在救一个无辜的人...
I thought I was saving the life of an innocent man and...

31:18.340 --> 31:21.110
我知道你没有看我给你的
And I know that you didn't read the information

31:21.120 --> 31:23.970
关于林肯·布伦斯的信息  但他是无辜的...
I gave you on Lincoln Burrows,but he is innocent and...

31:24.660 --> 31:26.730
很多卷入此事的人现在都死了
a lot of the people involved right now are dead.

31:31.980 --> 31:33.380
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

31:33.380 --> 31:37.140
这不是我给你打电话的原因
This isn't why I called you.

31:37.140 --> 31:40.160
我很好
I'm fine...

31:41.190 --> 31:42.420
但我很害怕
but I'm scared.

31:45.390 --> 31:46.120

Sara...

31:47.500 --> 31:49.100
我会帮你熬过去的
I'm gonna help you through this.

32:00.980 --> 32:02.340
我们根据你的要求进行了追踪
We ran that trace you requested.

32:02.340 --> 32:03.000
你找到什么了?
What'd you get?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.350
这个号码打不通
The line is disconnected.

32:05.070 --> 32:05.820
之前是谁的?
Whose was it?

32:05.820 --> 32:06.930
表面上看 谁的也不是
Apparently,no one's.

32:07.930 --> 32:08.600
什么意思?
What does that mean?

32:09.040 --> 32:10.650
这个号码已经有17年没被用过了
It's been out of service for 17 years.

32:18.020 --> 32:18.700
费尔南多
Fernando.

32:20.510 --> 32:21.190
她在哪?
Where is she?

32:21.200 --> 32:22.950
冷静 冷静
Oh,calm down. Calm down.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.330
她会下楼和你谈的
She's gonna come down and talk to you.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.240
她马上就来了
She's on her way down right now.

32:30.650 --> 32:32.000
我们很早就认识了
You and I got history.

32:32.920 --> 32:33.610
是一家人
We're family.

32:34.010 --> 32:35.230
出于这层关系
And out of respect for that,

32:35.230 --> 32:36.760
我会让她自己做决定的
I'm gonna let her make her own decision.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.080
我一定会带她走的
I'm not leaving without her.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.490
这应该让玛丽克鲁兹决定
That's for Maricruz to decide.

32:39.890 --> 32:41.530
你让她听够了你的废话
You've been filling her head with all this crap.

32:41.540 --> 32:42.700
她是个聪明的女孩
She's a smart girl.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.550
我个人认为她
I personally don't think she's gonna

32:44.550 --> 32:47.540
不会想跟你逃一辈子 但还是看着吧
want to live her life on the run,but we'll see.

32:47.540 --> 32:50.110
你知道 她不爱你 我现在不想讨论这些
You know,she doesn't love you. Yeah,I don't want to get into that right now.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.540
你不会抚养我的孩子的 我知道
You're not raising my kid.

32:59.660 --> 33:01.060
听起来不怎么舒服啊?老弟
That don't sound good,cuz.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.170
玛丽克鲁兹!
Maricruz!

33:06.930 --> 33:07.550
宝贝!
Baby!

33:07.550 --> 33:09.170
你得快走
Mari. You have to go.

33:09.170 --> 33:11.230
她在哪? 费尔南多  警察来了!
Wh-Where is she? Please,Fernando,they're coming!

33:11.230 --> 33:13.420
你跟她说我在这吗? 说了吗?!
Did you tell her I was here? Did you?!

33:17.530 --> 33:18.270
玛丽克鲁兹...
Maricruz...

33:50.620 --> 33:51.240
马宏
Mahone.

33:52.770 --> 33:53.690
我马上下来
I'll be right down.

34:00.970 --> 34:01.710
马宏先生
Mr. Mahone.

34:02.420 --> 34:03.040
药在哪?
Where are they?

34:03.610 --> 34:05.580
我很不容易才拿到这些
Had a hard time getting my hands on these.

34:05.590 --> 34:06.780
其实看医生很容易啊
It'd be easier to go to a doctor,

34:06.780 --> 34:09.730
告诉他你需要一些镇静药     医生会做记录的
tell him you need something to calm your nerves. Doctors take notes.

34:10.220 --> 34:11.400
所以我跟你买
That's why I have a deal with you.

34:11.820 --> 34:13.780
原来如此 我还以为我们的交易已经结束了
The way things been going,I thought maybe our deal was over.

34:14.380 --> 34:15.800
你没再问我关于希尔斯的事情了
You don't ask me about Shales no more.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.710
那个交易已经结束了
That part of our deal is over.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.480
我不再需要那件案子的消息了
I no longer need an informant on the case.

34:20.140 --> 34:21.960
你不是一直想找到他吗?
Thought that's all you cared about was finding him.
