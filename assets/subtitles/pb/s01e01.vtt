00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
■

00:25.800 --> 00:27.670
好了
That's it.

00:28.590 --> 00:32.500
能不能再让我欣赏一会儿
Can I just, you know,look at it for a minute?

00:33.230 --> 00:35.610
你真是个艺术家 希德
You're an artist, Sid.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.200
你是说 你就这么走了 然后我再也见不到这件艺术品了
You're telling me you're gonna walk outta here and I'm never gonna see it again?

00:41.210 --> 00:44.180
很大的可能性 是的
There's a good chance of that, yes.

00:44.190 --> 00:47.700
大多数人第一次 都会选择从小的图案纹起
Most guys, for the first one, they start with something small.

00:47.710 --> 00:50.750
妈妈或是女朋友 的姓名缩写什么的
"Mom", girlfriend's initials,something like that.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.020
而你却不同
Not you.

00:53.030 --> 00:56.660
短短的两个月 就做了整整一套
You get a full set of sleeves all in a couple of months.

00:56.670 --> 01:00.020
要是别人的话 可能要做好几年呢
It takes guys a few years to get the ink you got.

01:00.030 --> 01:02.600
我可没那么多时间
I don't have a few years.

01:03.340 --> 01:05.860
我也希望我有啊
Wish to hell I did.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.840
把保险柜打开
The vault. Open it.

02:00.850 --> 02:04.450
我们打不开 分行经理不在
We can't. The branch manager's not here.

02:04.460 --> 02:06.180
他在哪儿
Where is he?

02:06.190 --> 02:08.420
现在是午餐时间 他在白城堡
It's lunchtime. He's at White Castle.

02:08.430 --> 02:09.220
什么白城堡
White Castle?

02:09.230 --> 02:11.020
是个快餐店
A fast-food restaurant.

02:11.030 --> 02:13.780
他们有那种小的方形汉堡
They serve those little square burgers.

02:13.790 --> 02:16.260
我知道了
I know what it is.

02:17.740 --> 02:20.190
别以为我在跟你闹着玩 快点儿
I'm not playing games. Open it.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.830
先生 你包里已经有五十万现金了
Sir, you have half a million dollars cash in your bag.

02:22.840 --> 02:26.440
你再考虑一下 如果
Don't you think it'd be better if...?

02:35.740 --> 02:40.510
我们是警察 你已经被包围了
This is the police. You are completely surrounded.

02:41.990 --> 02:44.370
把枪放下
Put down your weapon.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.560
把枪放下 快点
Put down your weapons now!

02:51.660 --> 02:56.000
在我所遇到的持枪抢劫案中从未见过被告完全不替自己辩护的
Rarely in the case of armed robbery do we hear a plea of no contest.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.200
你真的不想辩护么 斯科菲尔德先生
Are you sure about this, Mr Scofield?

02:58.210 --> 02:59.460
是的 法官大人
I'm sure, Your Honour.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.010
法官大人 我请求休庭
Your Honour, we'd like to recess if we could.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.450
我的当事人现在有些神志不清
My client's a bit confused at the moment.

03:03.460 --> 03:05.800
-我很清醒   -法官大人 他不清醒
-I'm not.  -He is, Your Honour.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.760
或许你应该听取一下你律师的提议
Perhaps you should heed her advice.

03:08.770 --> 03:11.530
再用多一点的时间 去考虑你的回答
Take additional time to consider your response.

03:11.540 --> 03:14.100
我考虑好了 法官大人
I've already done that, Your Honour.

03:19.290 --> 03:21.970
我会在办公室决定如何判刑的
I'll retire to my chambers to determine sentencing.

03:21.980 --> 03:25.070
现在休庭 下午一点半继续开庭
Court's recessed until 1:30.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.810
我们走吧
Hey, come on. Let's go.

03:26.820 --> 03:29.100
迈克叔叔
Uncle Mike?

03:30.320 --> 03:32.640
我不想让你来
I didn't want you to come.

03:32.650 --> 03:34.470
回家去吧 LJ.
Go home, LJ.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.860
我不想让你看到我这样
I didn't want you to see this.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.220
他一时肯定会接受不了的
He won't take this well.

03:45.230 --> 03:47.110
这又能怪谁呢 他是你侄子
Can you blame him? He's your nephew.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.880
他会认为任何与他有联系的人都会进监狱
He's beginning to think anybody he attaches himself to is gonna end up in prison.

03:50.890 --> 03:55.230
并且他不是唯一一个这么认为的 迈克尔
And he's not the only one who's starting to feel that way, Michael.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.370
能给我们一些时间吗
Will you give us a minute?

03:57.380 --> 03:59.110
就一分钟
One minute.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.000
你难道还不明白么
Don't you understand?

04:01.010 --> 04:02.760
你完全放弃了你所有的权利
You just put the book in that woman's hand.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.940
那个女法官会毫不留情地判你的刑
She's gonna lob it at you like a grenade.

04:04.950 --> 04:07.320
审判和惩罚对她来说是一回事
Justice and punishment are the same thing to her.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.640
我知道
I know.

04:08.650 --> 04:11.210
告诉我你到底在想什么
then will you please tell me what's going through your head.

04:11.220 --> 04:12.390
我们已经谈过了
We've been over this.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.770
我一直都很了解你
I've known you all my life.

04:13.780 --> 04:16.140
你根本不是一个有暴力倾向的人
You don't have a violent bone in your body.

04:16.150 --> 04:18.030
况且你也不缺钱花
And I know you didn't need the money.

04:18.040 --> 04:18.980
维罗妮卡
Veronica...

04:18.990 --> 04:20.900
你为什么不让我来帮你呢
Why won't you let me help you?

04:20.910 --> 04:24.940
你已经对我很好了 真的 你一向如此
You've been good to me my whole life.

04:24.950 --> 04:28.760
但这次让我来处理此事 好吗
But you gotta let me deal with this. OK?

04:28.790 --> 04:31.060
鉴于你没有前科 这次抢银行是初犯
Given your lack of prior criminal conduct

04:31.070 --> 04:33.630
我很想给你减刑
I am inclined toward probation.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.830
但是 事实证明你使用了有致命杀伤力的武器
However,the fact that you discharged a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime

04:37.840 --> 04:39.480
说明你是蓄意犯罪
suggests malice to me.

04:39.490 --> 04:40.520
以此为据
For that reason

04:40.530 --> 04:45.560
我将判你入狱服刑 斯科菲尔德先生
I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr Scofield.

04:45.570 --> 04:48.830
你提出想被关押在芝加哥
It says here that you've requested to be incarcerated

04:48.840 --> 04:50.320
你家附近的监狱
somewhere near your home here in Chicago.

04:50.330 --> 04:51.930
我很愿意这样做
I'm willing to honour that.

04:51.940 --> 04:54.020
离那里最近的一级监狱
The closest level one facility to...

04:54.030 --> 04:55.130
一级监狱?
Level one?

04:55.140 --> 04:56.630
那可是戒备最森严的监狱 法官大人
That's maximum security. Your Honor.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.390
辩护律师请不要打断我
I would ask counsel to refrain from interrupting me.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.760
正如我所说
As I was saying

05:00.770 --> 05:04.620
离那最近的一级监狱是 狐狸河 州立监狱
the closest level one facility would be Fox River State Penitentiary.

05:04.630 --> 05:07.670
至于你的刑期 将会是五年
As for your sentence,I'm setting it at five years.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.430
刑期满一半时可以申请假释
You'll be eligible for parole in half that time.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.250
审判结果即刻生效
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

05:15.270 --> 05:25.310
伊利诺伊州 芝加哥郊区 狐狸河州立监狱

05:25.310 --> 05:27.730
都听好了 一个一个的进来接受检查
All right, people, step inside the door and check yourself for bugs.

05:27.740 --> 05:30.580
听到敲门声就进来 随着队伍向前移动
When you hear the knock, step out. Keep the line moving.

05:30.590 --> 05:33.350
我们不可能把一天的时间都浪费在你们身上
We ain't got all day to get this done.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.260
排队的时候 不准出声
No more talking in line.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.280
动作快点 你们还有不到5分钟的时间去洗澡
Move it. You got less than five minutes to take a shower.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.820
都动起来 快点 快往前走
Keep that line moving.Keep it moving.Move it. Right now.

05:38.820 --> 05:41.380
快点 抓紧时间
Let's go. Move, move.

05:41.390 --> 05:43.640

你是教徒吗 斯科菲尔德
Are you a religious man, Scofield?

05:48.820 --> 05:50.150
从来就没想过
Never thought about it

05:50.160 --> 05:53.070
很好 十戒在这里一文不值
Good,cos the Ten Commandments don't mean a box of piss in here.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.440
这里只有两戒
We got two commandments and two only.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.720
第一条戒律是你在这里毫无希望可言
The first commandment is,you got nothin' comin'.

05:56.730 --> 05:58.000
第二戒呢
What's the second commandment?

05:58.010 --> 06:00.360
参考第一条戒律
See commandment number one.

06:00.370 --> 06:02.070
明白了
Gotcha.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.950
你说话绕弯子么
You talking out the side of your neck?

06:03.960 --> 06:05.440

只想保持低调 不想引起注意 长官
Just trying to fly low, avoid the radar, boss.

06:10.780 --> 06:13.830
等到刑满释放
Do my time and get out.

06:14.030 --> 06:16.680
在我的地方谁也别想耍花样
There isn't any flyin' under my radar.

06:16.690 --> 06:18.680
我了解了
Good to know.

06:39.220 --> 06:41.590
嗨 长官 能不能找位兄弟上来装台空调
Hey,can a brother get some air conditioning up here,coach?

这里比吸毒妓女的热吻还要热
It's hotter than a crack ho's mouth,man.

06:43.860 --> 06:47.360
让空调去见鬼吧 我要吸毒的妓女
To hell with the AC, man.Give me the crack ho.

没人会替你服刑的
Ain't nobody gonna serve it for you!

07:25.500 --> 07:28.300
欢迎来到监狱乐园 小嫩鸡
Welcome to Prisneyland, fish.

07:53.950 --> 07:56.020
你想谈一下吗
You wanna talk about it?

07:56.030 --> 07:57.680
没有什么可谈的
It's not worth talking about.

07:57.690 --> 07:59.770
要是让你一直睡不着觉的话 当然有的
If it's keeping you up, it is.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.390
哦 只不过
No, it's just...

08:01.400 --> 08:04.010
其实也没什么
It's nothing, you know.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.760
是迈克尔的案子

08:06.790 --> 08:08.480
你已经尽力了
You did the best you could.

08:08.490 --> 08:10.650
但他却没有
But he didn't.

08:11.410 --> 08:13.730
他只想草草了事 没有任何争辩
He just sort of rolled over,he didn't put up a fight.

08:13.740 --> 08:16.020
真的太不像他了
It's not like him. I...

08:17.410 --> 08:19.490
对不起 我不应该提他的
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about him.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.980
嗨 这如果是你想的 就是你想的 不是吗
Hey, if it's on your mind, it's on your mind,right?

08:24.320 --> 08:26.610
晚安

狱警都是世界上最肮脏的流氓
the guards are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.

08:56.450 --> 08:58.140
他们与我们唯一的不同
The only difference between us and them

08:58.150 --> 08:59.850
就是他们有徽章

08:59.860 --> 09:01.120
抱着宠物的那个人是谁
Who's the pet lover?

09:01.130 --> 09:03.070
他一直不肯承认 他是 D.B. 库珀

Guy named Lincoln Burrows

10:04.430 --> 10:05.940
水缸 林克
Linc the Sink?

10:05.950 --> 10:07.480
他们现在这么叫他么
That what they're calling him now?

10:07.490 --> 10:08.190
没错
Yeah.

10:08.200 --> 10:12.240
他要是想找你麻烦 你可就死定了 小白脸
As in,he'll come at you with everything but the kitchen, snowflake.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.380
在哪儿能找到他
Where can I find him?

10:14.950 --> 10:17.220
这人谋杀了副总统的哥哥
Man killed the VP's brother.

10:17.230 --> 10:18.850

谁能把他怎样 杀他两次么
What are they gonna do, kill him twice?

10:25.030 --> 10:25.880
有没有办法让我接近他
There a way I can get to him?

10:25.890 --> 10:30.000
不太可能 他们只有在做礼拜和P.I.的时候才出来
oh,no,The only time those boys get out is for chapel and P.I.

10:30.010 --> 10:32.790
-P.I.是什么   -监狱工厂
-PI? What's that?   -Prison industry.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.840
他们都要去干活
The guys that get along, get to work

10:39.370 --> 10:41.060
小嫩鸡 如果我是你的话 才不会感到兴奋
I wouldn't get excited if I were you, fish.

10:41.060 --> 10:42.750
你连监狱工厂的味都闻不着
You ain't sniffin' none of P.I.

10:42.760 --> 10:43.980
为什么
Why's that?

10:43.990 --> 10:46.690

你为什么这么想见布伦斯
Why do you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?

10:56.050 --> 10:59.160
因为他是我哥哥
Because he's my brother.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.780
-他们驳回了上诉  -那就再上诉
-They denied the motion.   -Then do it again.

11:23.790 --> 11:25.500
不行 就这样了
I can't. That's it.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.500

11:38.170 --> 11:40.130
迈克尔 那人不是我杀的
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

11:40.140 --> 11:41.740
可他们有证据
The evidence says you did.

11:41.750 --> 11:44.640
我才不管什么证据 反正我没杀人
I don't care what the evidence says. I didn't kill him.

11:44.650 --> 11:46.980
向我发誓
Swear to me.

11:48.550 --> 11:50.740
我向你发誓 迈克尔
I swear to you, Michael.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.570
那么 他们 怎么会搞错呢
But how did they get it wrong, then?

11:58.580 --> 11:59.950
法庭 上诉
The courts, the appeals...

11:59.960 --> 12:02.510
不知道 我也不知道
Don't know. Don't know.

12:02.520 --> 12:06.180
现在回想起来 我是被陷害的
I keep thinking, looking back on it,is I was set up.

12:06.190 --> 12:08.120
不管是谁要陷害我
And whoever it was that set me up

12:08.130 --> 12:11.900
都想把我尽快至于死地
wants me in the ground as quickly as possible.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.350
表达爱意 还有其他什么词儿呢?
What's another word for "love"?

12:17.360 --> 12:18.700
什么情况下说的
What's the context?

12:18.710 --> 12:20.070
哦  就好像
Oh, you know.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.250
我很爱你
The "I love you so much

12:21.260 --> 12:24.410
再也不去酒馆胡闹 之类的
I ain't never knockin' over a liquor store again" context.

12:24.420 --> 12:25.910
还有 不用太华丽
Except, you know, classy.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.820
嗯
Mm.

12:27.890 --> 12:30.110
我就是想向女朋友求婚
I'm proposing to my girl, if you gotta know.

12:30.120 --> 12:30.970
在信里 
In a letter?

12:30.980 --> 12:31.930
你有更好的方法
You got a better way?

12:31.940 --> 12:33.960
当面说效果会更好
Face to face works pretty good.

12:33.970 --> 12:37.190
这可不是什么浪漫之地
This place ain't exactly the romantic spot.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.480
我要让她乘着史泰登岛渡轮
I'm gonna have her go get on the Staten Island Ferry

12:39.490 --> 12:41.800
然后当她看到了帝国大厦
then once she can see the Empire State Building

12:41.810 --> 12:43.270
这时她打开信
she opens the letter...

12:43.280 --> 12:45.660
我就差不多成功了
It's like almost being there

12:45.670 --> 12:48.190
但事实上 我根本做不到这一切
Except for the fact that I won't be there.

12:48.410 --> 12:49.770
用 爱恋 试试
Try "passion".

12:49.780 --> 12:54.170
哦 哦 爱恋 爱恋 这个词好 爱恋
Ooh! Ooh! "Passion. Passion" That's dope. Passion

12:55.130 --> 12:58.610
怎么拼的 p-a-s-h
How do you spell that? Is it P-A-S-H...?

12:58.920 --> 13:01.630
没有 h
No H?

13:07.470 --> 13:10.420
LJ 等一下 等一下
LJ, hold up. Hold up?

13:10.430 --> 13:12.760
我想 我办不到
I don't think I can go through with this.

13:12.770 --> 13:16.920
不会有事的 相信我
Everything's gonna be fine. Trust me.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.870

-We understand each other,then?  -yeah

13:27.880 --> 13:31.000
是星期五 不是星期六 也不是星期日 是星期五
Friday. Not Saturday, not Sunday. Friday.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.370
完全明白
Totally understood.

13:32.380 --> 13:34.610
面额是百元 五元 还有一元的 都不要
I don't want 100s,I don't want fives, I don't want ones.

13:34.620 --> 13:35.520
明白 明白
I know, I know.

13:35.530 --> 13:37.330
只要十元和二十元的
Tens and 20s only.

13:46.850 --> 13:48.950
开始行动
It's on.

14:00.790 --> 14:02.630
警察
Police!

14:25.180 --> 14:29.040
阿布鲁奇  我想让你雇我去监狱工厂
Abruzzi. I need you to hire me at P.I.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.610
爬开
Beat it.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.600
或许你该听听我要说的
Maybe you oughta hear what I gotta say.

14:33.610 --> 14:35.790
你没有我要的东西
You got nothing I need.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.930
我可不这么认为
Wouldn't be too sure of that.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.540
是我错了
My mistake.

14:42.550 --> 14:46.460
我想要的就是一只鸭子
Just what I need. A duck.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.200
监狱工厂  阿布鲁奇

14:48.210 --> 14:51.770
说不定我能帮上你大忙呢
You might find I can be of more assistance than you think.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.570
再考虑一下
Mull it over.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.600
想好了就来找我谈
Come find me when you're ready to talk.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.320
伙计们 都利索点
All right, guys. Pick it up.

15:07.330 --> 15:08.980
我今晚还想回家呢!
I wanna get home tonight.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.820
马齐奥
Maggio?

15:17.460 --> 15:18.390
说吧 什么事
Yeah. So?

15:18.400 --> 15:21.220
就是这个狗样娘的家伙指证阿布鲁奇的
That's the son of a bitch at fingered Abruzzi.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.900
菲波纳奇
That's Fibonacci?

15:24.350 --> 15:26.240
还以这个混蛋会永远消失呢
I thought that punk was gone forever.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.170
很明显  有人找到了他
Evidently somebody found him.

15:28.180 --> 15:30.350
看来有人想和我们玩游戏
somebody messin' with us?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.790
这个你肯定不信
This you're not gonna believe.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.620
这是什么
What is it?

15:42.140 --> 15:43.500
纹身看上去像新的
Tattoo looks fresh.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.500
按住
Hold that.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.770
看来糖尿病患者 还真不介意打针
I guess being a diabetic,you don't mind needles.

15:48.780 --> 15:50.490
我叫迈克尔
I'm Michael, by the way.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.980
斯科菲尔德 我看了你的资料
Scofield. I read your report.

15:52.990 --> 15:54.270
那么你是
And you are?

15:54.280 --> 15:56.340
叫我 唐克雷蒂 医生就行
Dr. Tancredi will do.

15:56.350 --> 15:58.970
和州长同姓唐克雷蒂?
"Tancredi" like the governor?

15:59.920 --> 16:02.210
你们不会是亲戚吧
You're not related, are you?

16:03.120 --> 16:08.930
真想不到州长的女儿会在监狱里工作
Wouldn't think you'd find the daughter of Frontier Justice Frank working in a prison.

16:08.940 --> 16:10.880
而且还是 医生
As a doctor, no less.

16:10.890 --> 16:14.060
我喜欢解决问题 而不是制造问题
I believe in being part of the solution,not the problem.Hm.

16:14.070 --> 16:19.540
通过改变自身来适应万变的世界
"Be the change you want to see in the world."

16:22.000 --> 16:23.670
怎么了
What?

16:24.570 --> 16:27.110
没什么 只不过这是我的座右铭
Nothing. That was just my senior quote.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.430
原来是你说的
That was you?

16:28.440 --> 16:31.280
我一直认为是甘地说的
This whole time I was thinking it was Gandhi.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.070

那么 我们怎么来治疗呢
So, how do we play this?

16:52.710 --> 16:54.690
你给我开几个星期的药吧
You hook me up with a few weeks' supply?

16:54.700 --> 16:55.540
想的美
Nice try.

16:55.550 --> 16:57.450
这里不允许有瘾君子的
No hypos on the floor.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.560
我是不会吸毒的 相信我
I'm the farthest thing from a junkie.Trust me.

16:59.570 --> 17:01.510
我告诉你  迈克尔
I got news for you,Michael.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.510
信任这东西 在监狱里一钱不值
"Trust me" means absolutely zero inside those walls.

17:04.520 --> 17:08.210
你接受胰岛素的途径 就是必须经由我允许
The only way you're getting that insulin is if I'm administering it.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.910
以后我们还会见面的 是么
Guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other,then,huh?

17:10.920 --> 17:12.770
我想是的
I guess so.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.140

17:27.870 --> 17:29.050
还有件事
Except for one thing

17:29.060 --> 17:32.090
马克莫拉主教不同意这么做
Bishop McMorrow is not in the fold.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.600
他和州长关系不错
He's got a lot of influence with the governor.

17:36.610 --> 17:39.510
他们以前是校友
They went to prep school together apparently.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.890
时间越近
Look, the closer it gets,

17:41.900 --> 17:43.360
我就越担心
the more I'm worried that the bottom

17:43.370 --> 17:46.460
总怕会出什么乱子
is gonna fall out of this whole thing.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.620
去安排我和主教大人见一次面
Well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit with the good bishop, then.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.500
记住 再有一个月
Look, in one month

17:56.510 --> 17:58.620
一切都会结束
 it'll all be over.

17:58.630 --> 18:02.940
人子必须被交在罪人手里(选自圣经 路加福音 第24章)
"The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men

18:02.950 --> 18:04.590
被钉在十字架上
and be crucified,

18:04.600 --> 18:06.970
第三日复活
and the third day rise again."

18:06.980 --> 18:10.850
他们记住了他的话 你们也应该那样做
And they remembered his words. And so should you.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.840
今天就到这里吧 愿上帝与你们同在
Good day, gentlemen. May God be with you.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.670
迈克尔
Michael?

18:33.170 --> 18:34.100
这是怎么回事
Why?

18:34.110 --> 18:37.030
我要把你弄出去
I'm getting you out of here.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.180
布伦斯 快点 快乐时光结束了
Burrows! Roll it up. Happy hour's over.

18:40.260 --> 18:41.710
根本不可能
It's impossible.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.730
除非监狱是你自己设计的
Not if you designed the place it isn't.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.700
太正式了
Too formal.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.530
太贺卡样了
Too greeting-card.

18:57.540 --> 19:00.420
这事迟早要决定的
We gotta make a decision sooner or later, you know.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.390
还有时间的啊
We have time.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.590
实际上 没有了
We don't, actually.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.060
有些时候 事情还是抓紧点的好
I mean, at some point, we gotta pull the trigger on this thing.

19:08.070 --> 19:09.870
我不想这么草率
I don't wanna rush this.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.940
人生只有一次 我不想出任何差错
We're only gonna do it once. We have to get it right.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.530
亲爱的 能问你个问题么
Honey, can I ask you something?

19:20.540 --> 19:22.350
当然了
Of course.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.170
你是不是要把(婚礼)推迟
Are you putting this off?

19:24.180 --> 19:25.480
你说什么啊
What do you mean?

19:25.490 --> 19:27.860

19:34.070 --> 19:35.680
只是我禁不住不去想它
I just can't help thinking this is about...

19:35.690 --> 19:37.930
不是这样的
It's not.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.370
我爱你
I love you.

19:40.530 --> 19:43.560
我要成为你的妻子
And I wanna be your wife.

19:46.490 --> 19:48.550
爱恋 你是怎么想的阿
"Passion"? What were you thinking?

19:48.560 --> 19:49.860
你自己也同意的
Hey, you went for it.

19:49.870 --> 19:52.040
她很可能认为我在这里变得娘娘腔了
She probably thinks I went sissy up in here.

19:52.050 --> 19:56.320
爱恋 多了一个字 话就变罗索了
"Passion".Got more than one syllable, too much talking.

19:56.330 --> 19:57.460
从现在开始
That's me from now on.

19:57.470 --> 19:58.640
以后只用单音节的词
One-Syllable Sucre.

19:58.650 --> 20:02.510
是 否 爱 恨 爱
"Yes","no","love","hate"..."love".

20:02.520 --> 20:04.930
-不要着急  -你开什么玩笑
-Give it time.  - Are you kidding?

20:04.940 --> 20:06.630
我在向她求婚
I proposed to her

20:06.640 --> 20:11.210
又不需要太多的时间 是 还是 不 一个字而已
That doesn't take time.Si or no. One syllable,man.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.860
她都是周二来探监的
She's supposed to come around for a conjugal on Tuesday.

20:15.870 --> 20:19.330
来之前她总是先打个电话的
She's always calling me beforehand,letting me know she's coming.

20:19.340 --> 20:22.910
可是这次 音信全无
This time, man, I ain't heard a peep.

20:23.170 --> 20:25.360
是你把她吓跑了
You spooked her.

20:25.530 --> 20:29.670
斯科菲尔德快起来 典狱长要见你
Scofield. Get it together. Pope wants to see you.

20:32.980 --> 20:34.780
这可不妙 小嫩鸡
No good, fish.

20:34.790 --> 20:36.980
从未有人见过典狱长
No one gets an audience with the Pope.

20:36.990 --> 20:40.300
除非他对你的所作所为感兴趣
Not unless he's real interested in what you got going on.

20:41.030 --> 20:43.000
芝加哥大学的高才生
Top of your class at Loyola.

20:43.010 --> 20:45.770
还成绩优秀
Magna cum laude, in fact.

20:46.310 --> 20:49.020
真不敢想象像你这么有资历的人
I can't help wondering what someone with your credentials

20:49.030 --> 20:51.600
竟然会来到这种地方
is doing in a place like this.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.070
我想可能是几个月前走错路了
Took a wrong turn a few months back, I guess.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.130
听你说起来就像是交通违规一样
You make it sound like a traffic infraction,

20:57.140 --> 21:00.090
蹲监狱与单行道上逆向行车 是两码事
Like all you did was turn the wrong way up a one-way street.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.970
谁都有犯错误的时候
Everyone turns up one sooner or later.

21:05.980 --> 21:08.270
我叫你来的原因是
The reason I called you here,

21:08.450 --> 21:11.320
我看了你的档案 在职业一栏里
I noticed in your l-file, under "Occupation",

21:11.330 --> 21:14.200
你写的 无业
you put down "unemployed".

21:14.210 --> 21:16.770
那不是真的 对么
That's not true, now,is it?

21:18.820 --> 21:22.990
斯科菲尔德 我知道你是个结构学工程师
I know you're a structural engineer, Scofield.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.480
沙伽罕建造了泰姬陵
Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal

21:28.490 --> 21:31.520
以此来表达他对妻子爱的永恒
as a monument to his undying love for his wife.

21:31.530 --> 21:34.400
我老婆很喜欢这个故事
My wife is quite fond of the story.

21:34.410 --> 21:37.260
她认为非常浪漫
It appeals to the romantic in her.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.890
嫁给了一个像我这样工作的人
Being married to someone in corrections,

21:40.900 --> 21:42.330
是一件恐怖的事
terrible job.

21:42.340 --> 21:44.410
谁会愿意呢
Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

21:44.420 --> 21:49.610
但在这三十九年里我老婆从没有抱怨过
And yet, in 39 years, my wife has never complained.

21:49.620 --> 21:52.910
更遗憾的是 我从未感谢过她
And the worst part of it is,I've never thanked her.

21:54.340 --> 21:57.020
因为我说不出口
So, because I couldn't say it,

21:57.030 --> 21:59.870
我想做一个
I thought, you know, I could build it.

22:00.600 --> 22:04.150
这个六月就是我们结婚40周年纪念日
Come June, it's our 40th anniversary.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.270
但是这里  你看
But here, look...

22:07.280 --> 22:09.170
你看  问题是
You see, the problem is,

22:09.180 --> 22:11.010
我造得越多
I build anymore,

22:11.020 --> 22:14.180
它就会像空中楼阁一样塌下来
it's all gonna come down like a house of cards.

22:14.190 --> 22:17.220
我想你能帮助我一下
That's where I was hoping you could be of assistance.

22:17.270 --> 22:21.200
作为回报 你每周可以在这里工作三天
for the favour,I can offer you three days of work a week in here

22:21.210 --> 22:23.970
也就不必去什么操场了
and it'll keep you off the yard.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.320
我做不了
I can't do it.

22:33.700 --> 22:40.690
孩子 我敢肯定 在这里让我欠你人情要比你欠我的好
Son,it's better for me to owe you one in here than it is for you to owe me one,

22:40.700 --> 22:42.660
我会考虑的
I'll take my chances.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.590
咱们没什么好谈的了
Then we're through here.

22:47.980 --> 22:49.640
警卫
Guard!

22:51.990 --> 22:54.390
两磅的大麻
Two pounds of pot?

22:54.440 --> 22:56.710
你想干什么  留下案底么
What were you trying to do, set a record?

22:56.720 --> 23:00.360
一点都不好笑 LJ 你很可能会进监狱的
It's not funny, LJ. You could be going to jail.

23:01.400 --> 23:04.670
看来需要人来好好教教你
It's pretty obvious to me you need some guidance.

23:05.530 --> 23:07.380
嗨
Hey.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.890
谢谢
Thanks.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.810
找谁来合适呢 沃布客斯 老爸吗
From who? Old Daddy Warbucks?

23:12.820 --> 23:14.560
给他个机会 他是一个好人
Give him a chance. He's a good man.

23:14.570 --> 23:16.640
我们没有共同语言
We got nothing in common.

23:16.650 --> 23:19.010
你到底是怎么了 LJ
Where's this coming from, LJ?

23:19.020 --> 23:22.930
上学期你几乎全是A 可现在
Last semester you were getting almost all As, and now...

23:25.410 --> 23:26.990
是你父亲 对不
It's your father, isn't it?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.360
我没有父亲
I don't have a father.

23:28.370 --> 23:32.150
你这么做可不明智 相信我
It wasn't an immaculate conception, honey. Trust me.

23:34.540 --> 23:37.380
也许你应该去看看他了
Maybe it's time you went and saw him.

23:37.860 --> 23:39.220
妈妈
Mom

23:39.230 --> 23:41.130
妈妈
Mom.

23:41.150 --> 23:41.760
不要
Don't.

23:41.770 --> 23:43.600
我也想让你有个美好的未来
I'm about as excited by the prospect as you are,

23:43.610 --> 23:45.210
但是有些东西是必需要放弃的
but something's gotta give

23:45.220 --> 23:48.860
你再这样下去会毁了自己前程的
You have got too much potential to be screwing up your life like this.

23:52.950 --> 23:56.690
如果他们把你送到 泰勒维尔 或是 马里昂 怎么办
What if they'd sent you to Taylorville or Marion and not here?

23:56.740 --> 23:59.100
我想我也会这么做的
I think I'd be doing the same thing I'm doing in here,

23:59.110 --> 24:01.520
吃吃果冻 喝喝饮料
eating Jell-O,drinking Kool-Aid.

24:01.530 --> 24:03.480
我知道你要干什么
I know what you're doing.

24:03.490 --> 24:06.890
你和林肯被关到一起绝非巧合
It's not luck of the draw that you're in here with Lincoln.

24:07.010 --> 24:09.530
你忘了我非常了解你们俩
You forget I know you. Both of you

24:09.540 --> 24:13.280
你们兄弟之间的感情 恐怕是我见过的最特别的了
You two have the most dysfunctional idea of love I've ever seen.

24:13.290 --> 24:15.660
他为了不让你在街头胡闹而打你
What,he beats you up to keep you off the street,

24:15.670 --> 24:18.580
现在你又主动和他关在一起
so you get yourself tossed into Fox River with him?

24:18.590 --> 24:19.780
为了什么
To what?

24:19.790 --> 24:21.710
救他
Save him?

24:23.350 --> 24:26.450
你应该告诉我 我曾像你一样的爱他
I deserve to know. I loved him as much as you did.

24:26.460 --> 24:29.840
你的爱已成往事 而我的却不是
Past tense for you, maybe. Not me.

24:29.850 --> 24:32.960
我大学毕业后曾给过他机会
I gave him a shot when I got back from college. I did.

24:32.970 --> 24:34.670
即使在那种情况下
Even with all the stuff that was going on with him,

24:34.680 --> 24:37.570
我还是尽我所能的帮助他 他却不把这些当回事
I did all I could to make it work, and he threw it away.

24:37.580 --> 24:41.230
你是否曾想过在你离开他的时候 他非常的伤心
You ever think maybe he was hurt that you left in the first place?

24:41.710 --> 24:43.240
不要这样做
Don't do this.

24:43.250 --> 24:44.950
无论你想做什么 不要做
Whatever it is you're doing,don't do it.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.400
会有更好的办法的 我已经提出上诉了
there's a better way.I'm already appealing your case.

24:47.410 --> 24:48.580
我告诉过你不要再管这件事了
I told you to leave alone

24:48.590 --> 24:50.990
我已经和林肯所在地区的主教取得了联系上了
I've gotten in touch with the diocese about Linc.The bishop...

24:51.000 --> 24:54.400
没用的 只能延缓一下时间而已
That won't stop it. It'll only delay it.

24:58.210 --> 24:59.660
你真想帮忙么
You wanna do something?

24:59.670 --> 25:02.460
找出是谁要至他于死地
You find out who's trying to bury him.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.730
没有人要至他于死地
Nobody's trying to bury him.

25:06.740 --> 25:08.340
证据确凿
The evidence was there.

25:08.350 --> 25:10.440
证据是伪造的
The evidence was cooked.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.250
探监时间结束了
Visiting hours are now over.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.650
照顾好自己
Take care of yourself.

25:23.420 --> 25:25.860
有人要他死 维罗妮卡
Someone wants him dead, Veronica.

25:25.870 --> 25:28.510
有太多的阴谋
Something more is going on here.

25:28.680 --> 25:32.050
这是在绝望 迈克尔 你是在否定事实 面对现实吧
This is desperation,Michael.You're grabbing at straws.You're in denial.

25:32.060 --> 25:36.830
或许是吧 我不能看着他死 我做不到
Maybe. But I can't watch him die.I won't do that.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.260
先生们
Gentlemen.

26:07.270 --> 26:10.700
布伦斯的事 我能帮上什么忙
What is it about the Burrows situation that I can help you with?

26:10.750 --> 26:14.720
我们认为你对州长有着很大的影响力
It's our understanding that you have great influence with the governor.

26:14.830 --> 26:18.050
我不会说是 非常大 或是什么 影响力
I wouldn't say it's great, or influence.

26:18.060 --> 26:19.140
我们是朋友
We're friends.

26:19.150 --> 26:22.430
我们知道 您反对死刑
It's also our understanding that you oppose the death penalty.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.460
我是上帝的子民 当然会这么认为了
I'm a man of God. How could I not?

26:24.470 --> 26:27.620
在这个案子里 我们希望您能改变一下立场
In this case,we're hoping you'll suspend that position

26:27.630 --> 26:29.440
至少是暂时的
at least temporarily.

26:29.450 --> 26:33.260
如果囚犯需要我的干涉
If the inmate appeals to me for intervention,

26:33.270 --> 26:35.010
我怎么能坐视不管呢
how can I turn my back on him?

26:35.020 --> 26:38.000
我很欣赏 您用问题来回答问题
You have a habit of answering a question with a question.

26:38.010 --> 26:42.160
你的方式好像是 用问题来问更多的问题
And you have a way of asking questions that beg more questions.

26:46.030 --> 26:47.480
这么说来您是不同意了
Are you saying you won't do it?

26:47.490 --> 26:50.010
我的话已经够明确的了
I'm not a man to equivocate.

26:53.180 --> 26:53.970
您
You're what,

26:53.980 --> 26:56.160
现在已经62岁了
62 years old now, Your Excellency?

26:56.170 --> 26:57.030
没错
That's right.

26:57.040 --> 26:57.980
那么 我想
I would assume, then,

26:57.990 --> 27:00.790
您应该很清楚政府的税收政策吧
that you should be well-versed in how our government's tax system works.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.830
在教会掩护下中饱私囊
Taking personal capital gains under the church's tax shelter,

27:04.840 --> 27:07.930
难道阁下不认为这是一种欺骗么
well,that would be fraud, wouldn't it, Your Excellency?

27:08.150 --> 27:12.530
我是不会因为恐惧 而放弃自己的信念的
I will not be cowed into forsaking my beliefs.

27:12.550 --> 27:15.520
你吓不倒我 谁也做不到
Not by you, or anyone else.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.780
佩服
Admirable.

27:17.790 --> 27:19.860
再见
Good day, Excellency.

27:20.170 --> 27:22.290
凯勒曼 先生
Mr Kellerman

27:23.180 --> 27:27.210
情报局为什么对这个案件如此感兴趣
what is it about this case that the Secret Service is so interested in?

27:27.220 --> 27:30.120
那人杀了副总统的哥哥
The man killed the Vice-President's brother.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.490
-他说什么  -你听我说
-What did you say?  -You heard me.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.470
有人找到了菲波纳奇
Someone found Fibonacci.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.250
我正看着这张照片呢
I'm looking at the photos right now.

27:43.260 --> 27:45.830
狗娘养的留了胡子 还戴着太阳镜
Son of a bitch has got a beard,sunglasses.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.930
一看就是 证人保护计划
Witness protection if I ever saw it.

27:47.940 --> 27:49.430
谁提供的消息
Who was this someone?

27:49.440 --> 27:52.190
信封上面没有回信地址
There's no return address on the envelope.

27:52.200 --> 27:58.120
只有一个纸做的小鸟
Just...this folded-up bird

27:59.370 --> 28:00.900
折纸么
made of paper.

28:00.910 --> 28:02.660
没错 就是
Like origami.

28:02.670 --> 28:05.400
对 是的
Yeah,like that,like origami.

28:38.530 --> 28:40.530
你是 查尔斯·韦斯特莫兰德 对吗
You're Charles Westmoreland, right?

28:40.540 --> 28:41.710
咱们认识么
Do I know you?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.940
我在你老婆逝世前曾认识她
I knew your wife, before she passed.

28:43.950 --> 28:47.020
-你认识 玛拉   -你说得是 安妮
-You knew Marla?   -You mean Ann?

28:47.030 --> 28:48.750
你是怎么认识她的
How'd you know her?

28:48.760 --> 28:50.750
我们在波士顿有过谈话
We taught together in Boston.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.360
-东法明敦吗   -你是说 西威灵顿 吗
-East Farmington.   -You mean West Wilmington?

28:54.370 --> 28:56.240
别再考我了
No more tests

28:56.250 --> 28:58.130
我保证
I promise.

28:58.660 --> 29:01.070
你好像知道我的一切
Seems you know everything about me.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.580
-你是谁  -迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
-Who are you?  -Michael Scofield.

29:03.590 --> 29:05.460
你是怎么把它带进来的
How'd you get it in here?

29:05.470 --> 29:07.720
首先  她不是它
First off, she's not an it.

29:07.730 --> 29:09.610
她是 玛尔林
She's Marilyn

29:09.620 --> 29:12.350
自从监狱允许囚犯带宠物
and she's grandfathered back from the days

29:12.350 --> 29:15.080
她就被带进来了
when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.650
我听说你是 D.B. 库珀
I heard you were DB Cooper.

29:18.610 --> 29:20.500
一旦有新人来到这里
Every new fish comes in here

29:20.510 --> 29:21.840
总能听到
first thing they hear

29:21.850 --> 29:24.460
查尔斯·韦斯特莫兰德 是 D.B.库珀
is that Charles Westmoreland is DB Cooper.

29:24.470 --> 29:27.660
我会像告诉他们一样的告诉你
I'll tell you like I tell them.

29:27.860 --> 29:30.020
你想听 库珀 的故事么
You want the Cooper story?

29:30.030 --> 29:33.150
我什么也告诉不了你 因为我不是他
I can't give it to you, cos I'm not him.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.220
真可惜
It's too bad.

29:34.230 --> 29:37.600
真希望 是真的 一个传奇式的人物
sort of wish it was true. The man's a legend.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.520
没有人比我还想了 朋友
Nowhere near as much as I wish it were true, friend.

29:40.530 --> 29:44.190
那样我就会在外面有一百五十万了
I'd have a million five waiting for me on the outside.

29:46.410 --> 29:49.890
如果我是你的话我会小心点
I'd put some grass under'em if I were you.

29:50.360 --> 29:53.640
如果你雇我的话 一切都会变得简单
This thing'd go a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me.

29:53.650 --> 29:56.190
你到底想怎样
What is this all about?

29:56.200 --> 29:59.180
如果有人能把你弄出这里的高墙去
Say you were able to get outside those walls.

29:59.320 --> 30:02.280
你能不能找人帮他销声匿迹
would you have the people in place to make you disappeared forever?

30:02.290 --> 30:04.830
-你问这个干嘛  -只是出于好奇
-What do you care?  -I'm just curious.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.050
菲波纳奇在哪儿
Where's Fibonacci?

30:07.060 --> 30:09.250
这不是解决事情的方法
That's not the way it works.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.160
他们要是敢动我 约翰
They come at me, John

30:15.170 --> 30:17.380
我不会放过你的
I'm coming after you.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.380
我还真不信
I doubt it.

30:45.220 --> 30:47.820
好吧
All right.

30:56.660 --> 30:58.890
我完全把你看错了 斯科菲尔德
I totally misjudged you, Scofield.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.390
我认为你不是一个惹事生非的人
I didn't think you were the agitating type.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.290
像那样的事情在我的监狱里是不允许的
Behaviour like that will not be tolerated in my prison.

31:04.300 --> 31:05.510
九十天的禁闭
90 days in the SHU

31:05.520 --> 31:07.740
足够让你想清楚的了
That ought to be enough time to convince you of that fact.

31:07.750 --> 31:08.600
九十天
90 days?

31:08.610 --> 31:10.360
没错
That's right.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.390
你还想说什么
Something you wanna say?

31:19.400 --> 31:21.700
只是...
It's just...

31:22.140 --> 31:24.220
要是在禁闭房里我就不能帮你了
I'm not of much value to you in the SHU.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.060
帮我
Value?

31:25.070 --> 31:27.470
恩 泰姬陵
Hm- mm... the Taj.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.050
要是由于承重压力分布不均
It'd be a shame for the 8th wonder of the modern

31:30.050 --> 31:32.620
而使世界第八大奇迹倒塌可就太可惜了
world to collapse 'cause the stress's improperly propagated

31:32.630 --> 31:33.890
重力什么分布不均?
Improperly propagated?

31:33.900 --> 31:35.600
承重压力分布不均
Improperly propagated

31:35.610 --> 31:37.390
结合处超过了承重极限
The joints are overloaded.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.190
从而不能再提供任何的承载力
They won't provide anywhere near the sheer strength

31:39.200 --> 31:42.270
以承受整个建筑物的荷载了
the completed structure will need.

31:42.750 --> 31:44.960
需要花费多长的时间
How much work are we talking?

31:44.970 --> 31:46.360
你是想在6月完成吧
You want it by when, June?

31:46.370 --> 31:47.640
是的
Yes.

31:47.650 --> 31:50.760
那么现在就该开工了 你说呢
Then we'd better get started,wouldn't you say?

32:17.440 --> 32:19.550
谁啊
Who's there?

32:36.800 --> 32:38.800
马克莫拉主教昨晚被杀了
Bishop McMorrow was killed last night.

32:38.810 --> 32:41.700
在他睡觉的时候 被人枪杀了
Someone shot him while he was sleeping.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.190
我想 你可能想知道
I thought you'd wanna know.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.140
谢谢
Thanks.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.710

33:23.300 --> 33:26.100

33:38.010 --> 33:40.070
他被捕了
He was arrested.

For what?

33:42.220 --> 33:44.550
携带大麻
Possession of marijuana.

33:47.060 --> 33:50.870

I figured he could use some fatherly advice before it's...

33:51.360 --> 33:52.570
在被 处决 之前
Gone forever?

33:52.580 --> 33:53.690
我没那个意思
I didn't mean that.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.950
我知道 谢谢你 莉莎
I know you didn't. Thanks, Lisa.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.970
坐吧
Sit down.

34:04.170 --> 34:05.850
大麻是么
Dope, huh?

34:05.860 --> 34:08.280
吸食还是贩卖
Using or dealing?

34:08.600 --> 34:10.380
有区别么
What's the difference?

34:10.390 --> 34:11.500
你想干什么
Then what? you, uh,

34:11.510 --> 34:14.530
想混出名气么
think it gives you some kind of street cred?

34:15.500 --> 34:18.720
你有美好的前程 要好好珍惜
You got a piece of the good life. Take advantage.

34:18.730 --> 34:20.550
好的 我明白了
Look, I get it.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.280
你们那一套
The whole thing.

34:22.290 --> 34:24.410

34:29.140 --> 34:32.260
哈佛 长大后成为一名牙医
Harvard, grow up and be a dentist.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.920
总比待在这里好
It's better than being here.

34:35.950 --> 34:37.390
你要明白 受惩罚的是你自己
You gotta realise who's getting punished

34:37.400 --> 34:39.070
你做的那些事
when you're doing the things you're doing.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.980
别以为受惩罚的是我 那会是你自己
You think it's me. It's you.

34:40.990 --> 34:42.450
我过去也曾这样过
I did the same thing.

34:42.460 --> 34:44.040
因为一个老人的离开而去责怪他
Punished the old man cos he was gone.

34:44.050 --> 34:46.650
