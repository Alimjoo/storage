手术的代价是把"锡拉"安全找回来

00:10.930 --> 00:13.430
我确信你们明白
i'm sure you understand no one can know

00:13.430 --> 00:15.190
不能让人知道"锡拉"的去向
where scylla's going.

00:17.260 --> 00:18.930
你知道是谁拿走了吗
do you know who took it?

00:18.930 --> 00:21.130
不  但赛尔夫和格雷琴知道

无论你有什么计划把我们从这弄出去

我们最好有所行动
we better make a move on it.

迈克尔  你不能离开这里
you're not getting out of here, michael.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.190
我做了个交易
i made a deal.

00:49.190 --> 00:51.030
用"锡拉"换回你的命
your life in exchange for scylla.

00:51.030 --> 00:52.330
就凭你对"公司"的了解
you think you can do that

00:52.330 --> 00:53.860
你以为你能做到吗
knowing what you know about the company?

00:53.860 --> 00:55.290

迈阿密  偷走"锡拉"的人在这
miami. the guy who took scylla's here.

01:25.290 --> 01:28.130
你真的要帮"公司"找回"锡拉"吗
so you're-you're actually trying to get it back for the company?

01:28.130 --> 01:30.690
只有这样  我们才能
i'm gonna give it back to the company so we can

01:30.690 --> 01:31.530
摆脱这一切

我很感激你  因为迈克尔当时命悬一线
i'm grateful to you, because he was gonna die.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.590
但是  你真的认为
but do you really think that

02:09.590 --> 02:12.190
他们拿到"锡拉"后  会放过我们吗
they're just gonna let us live when we give them scylla?

02:12.190 --> 02:13.930
莎拉  我尽力而为吧
you know what, sara, i'm doing my best.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.660
如果有迈克尔的消息
just-just call me

追查到一个地址
it's a number, and it goes to this address--

02:29.730 --> 02:30.690
我们如何得知
how do we know this guy's

02:30.690 --> 02:31.730
他还在迈阿密
still in miami,

02:31.730 --> 02:33.190
而且没有把"锡拉"卖出去
that he hasn't sold it already, huh?

02:33.190 --> 02:34.690
我不是抱怨什么
not that i'm complaining.

02:34.690 --> 02:37.060
我在这个州可有过不少"历史"
i've had some filthy, filthy times in this state.

02:37.060 --> 02:38.190
千万别搞砸了
don't screw this up, all right?

02:38.190 --> 02:41.100
这可是我们唯一的线索
because that's our only lead on this guy.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.260
你应该感谢我当时没杀你
be thankful i haven't killed you.

是吗  你以为你是埃利奥特·奈斯吗[联邦神探]
oh, yeah? wh-what are you, eliot ness now? huh?

02:48.490 --> 02:49.860
别装得好像
'cause don't act like

02:49.860 --> 02:51.530
你从来没对别人做过同样的事
you haven't done that to ten times as many people.

02:51.530 --> 02:53.760
我们都一样  林肯
all right? we're just crooks that got caught, lincoln.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.830
这个
this...

02:55.830 --> 02:58.130
这小子  他去是没用的
this guy, this isn't gonna work.

02:58.130 --> 03:01.460
我们还是关注"锡拉"在谁手里吧
why don't we all just focus on who's got scylla.

03:01.460 --> 03:04.060
你觉得呢
what do you say?

04:10.390 --> 04:13.490
斯科菲尔德
hey, scofield.

位于某处60英里外
60 miles from anywhere.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.960
没有武器
swept clean of weapons, so you don't need

04:31.960 --> 04:33.560
所以你不用白费心机了
to worry your head about that.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.190
窗户和门上都没有栏杆
there are no bars on the windows or the doors,

04:36.190 --> 04:38.590
但附近区域有三种美洲狮出没
but there are three types of mountain lion in the area,

04:38.590 --> 04:40.260
所以你最好呆在这里
so you might want to stay close by.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.490
我来说吧
i'll take it from here.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.530

04:58.790 --> 05:00.530
说完了吧
are we done?

05:00.530 --> 05:03.890
你的行动都是建立在
you've been operating under some...

05:03.890 --> 05:05.860
对"公司"的错误看法上的
misconceptions about the company,

05:05.860 --> 05:07.160
将军希望

她离开你和你哥哥  是为了保护你们
she left you and your brother to protect you.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.290
以免受到太阳能合成工作的威胁吗
from the dangers of solar synthesis work?

她一直在马达加斯加的雨林里工作

07:43.590 --> 07:45.090
没有卫星信号
without satellite access.

07:45.090 --> 07:49.930
或者她已经过世25年了
or she wasn't alive, hasn't been for 25 years,

07:49.930 --> 07:53.290
这些都是你编的
and this is all fiction.

07:53.290 --> 07:58.160
因为你妈妈的研究  科尔多瓦外的荒地
there's a million acres, corn and soy, outside cordoba

07:58.160 --> 08:02.190
现在变成了绿油油的田地
that was arid scrub before your mother's research.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.930
那不是我编的
that's not fiction,

08:03.930 --> 08:05.430
那些食物
that's food...

08:05.430 --> 08:07.130
可以养活成千
for thousands.

08:07.130 --> 08:08.260

08:10.690 --> 08:12.990
听起来  我们还有很多要谈
it sounds like we'd have a lot to talk about.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.830
为什么不直接给她打电话
why don't you get her on the phone.

08:14.830 --> 08:17.260
等你准备好

08:17.260 --> 08:20.290

08:55.930 --> 08:58.160
她在路上了
she's on her way.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.860
我的天啊
oh, my god!

09:01.860 --> 09:05.530
为什么他要打酒吧的电话  而不打给埃里卡呢
why'd this guy call the club's phone and not erica's?

09:05.530 --> 09:06.860
我...他们经常吵架
i... they fight a lot,

09:06.860 --> 09:10.190
她不接电话  他就打酒吧的电话
so when she doesn't answer, he calls the club.

09:11.630 --> 09:13.490
你找他干什么
what do you want with this guy?

09:13.490 --> 09:15.630
他拿了我的东西
he took something that belongs to me.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.560
-他到底是谁  -我不知道
- who the hell is he? - i don't know.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.760
他相信 你是那个女人的朋友
he bought the whole thing about you being friends

10:34.760 --> 10:36.230
的话了
with this chick or whatever?

10:36.230 --> 10:38.100
他不知道我才是你女朋友
he didn't know i was with you,

10:38.100 --> 10:42.130
当他知道时  他只想躲别人的子弹
and by the time he did, he was trying not to get shot.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.360
你做得很好
you did good.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.930

10:51.930 --> 10:54.430
这是那个陷害我的小妞的
this is the chick who set me up.

10:54.430 --> 10:56.730
我们找到她  就能找到那个人
we find her, we find our guy.

10:56.730 --> 10:58.600
在酒吧打架  公共场所开枪
busting up clubs, firing shots in public.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.730
你再这么干下去  我们就别想在这呆了
you keep that up and we're not going to last here much longer.

11:01.730 --> 11:04.860
我可没打算在这久留  你想吗
i don't plan on staying here very long. you?

11:04.860 --> 11:07.730
瞧  这就是我为什么佩服将军
see, that's why i have to give it up to the general.

11:07.730 --> 11:09.900
他把四个敌人放在一起  保准起内讧
he puts four enemies together, guaranteed dissension.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.930
但不会有同谋造反
no alliances form against him.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.130
这是那家伙女友的地址
this is our guy's girlfriend's address.

11:14.130 --> 11:15.130
他估计跑路了
he's probably gone,

11:15.130 --> 11:17.730
看看能找到什么
but see what you can find.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.960
这就是蒂亚
this is tia.

11:24.230 --> 11:27.960
你想知道我对他们的谈话的想法吗
do you want to know what i think they were talking about?

11:27.960 --> 11:29.600
我不管
i don't care.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.100
只要他们不挡我的道
just as long as they keep out of my way.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.800
你也一样
same with you.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.230
让她进来
send her in.

11:46.130 --> 11:48.830
莎拉  你看来
sarah! you're looking...

11:48.830 --> 11:50.730
精神不错
rested.

11:50.730 --> 11:52.290
那宾馆怎么样
how is the hotel?

11:52.290 --> 11:54.260
我想在迈克尔康复期间
i would like to offer my professional

11:54.260 --> 11:56.290
提供我的专业协助
assistance in michael's rehabilitation.

11:56.290 --> 11:59.230
很好
kind...

11:59.230 --> 12:00.290
但他接受的是最优秀的照顾
but he's receiving excellent care.

12:00.290 --> 12:01.800
你没必要担心
there's nothing for you to worry about.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.630
不管你为他准备了什么
whatever it is you have planned for him,

12:03.630 --> 12:06.800
我只想帮忙维持他的健康
i would simply like to help maintain his health.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.660
很感激你  但是不行
and that's appreciated, but it's impossible.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.960
相信我  妳现在最好
believe me, you serve michael best

12:12.960 --> 12:14.260
跟迈克尔保持一定距离
at a distance right now.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.530
相信我
trust me.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.030
我只想看看他是否安好
i have no agenda apart from simply...

12:21.030 --> 12:24.860
别无所求
wanting to see that he's okay.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.330
三天或一星期后
and in three days to a week,

12:26.330 --> 12:29.130
他就会回到你爱的怀抱
he'll be back in your loving arms forever.

12:29.130 --> 12:31.930
好的  我没这个耐心
okay, i'm not that patient.

12:31.930 --> 12:34.100
放任一下自己吧
indulge yourself.

12:34.100 --> 12:37.460
坐在泳池边
sit by the pool,

12:37.460 --> 12:39.390
想象一下将来
envision the future:

12:39.390 --> 12:40.760
财政安全
financial security,

12:40.760 --> 12:44.500
迈克尔的才干能在世界范围内应用
michael's talents being utilized on a global scale,

12:44.500 --> 12:45.830
你能在旁看他创新
you beside him innovating.

12:45.830 --> 12:49.360
迈克尔的才干能在世界范围内应用
michael's talents being utilized on a global scale?

12:49.360 --> 12:53.460
我只是想最大化他的潜力
i'm simply trying to maximize his potential.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.160
你的也是
yours, too.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.900
你对他做了什么
what's being done to him?

12:57.900 --> 13:03.860
我要结束这种猫捉老鼠的游戏
i'm putting an end to this exhausting cat-and-mouse.

13:03.860 --> 13:07.000
谢谢你专程来访
thank you for stopping by.

13:17.660 --> 13:21.530
激进建筑学一直被
"radical architecture is a rejection of all formal

13:21.530 --> 13:23.960
传统方式所反对
and moral parameters."

13:23.960 --> 13:25.530
出自你的论文
from your thesis.

13:25.530 --> 13:29.000
严重扭曲了某人的话
someone else's words heavily paraphrased.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.430
并且这只适用于建筑和结构
and it pertains to buildings, structures.

13:32.430 --> 13:34.160
我认为你是用于隐喻
i think you meant it as a metaphor.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.860
结果印证方式吗
what, that the ends justify the means?

13:36.860 --> 13:38.100
这跟你母亲的理论
which neatly

13:38.100 --> 13:39.460
惊人的一致
coincides with your mother's philosophy.

13:39.460 --> 13:41.760
你知不知道  30年前
did you know that she had an almost identical quote

13:41.760 --> 13:43.660
她在论文里
in her thesis?

13:43.660 --> 13:45.700
引述过几乎同样一句话
from 30 years ago.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.960
你倒是做了不少功课啊
you've done a lot of homework.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.130
只是找些话题
just a few conversations.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.430
我猜你们在"公司"的圣诞派对上
let me guess. you two had some kind of moment

13:53.430 --> 13:55.200
有过一段美妙时光吧
at the company Christmas party?

13:55.200 --> 13:58.700
我认识你母亲很久了
I’ve known your mother for years.

13:58.700 --> 14:02.100
了解到你和她一样聪明绝顶
well enough to know you've got the same brilliant mind

14:02.100 --> 14:04.760
很有幽默感
and the same sense of humor, for that matter.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.130
这和幽默没关系吧
I’m guessing this isn't about my sense of humor.

14:07.130 --> 14:09.360
她最初
she was just

14:09.360 --> 14:13.530
也不愿加入"公司"
as resistant to joining the company,

14:13.530 --> 14:15.330
但当她了解了事实
but then she learned the truth.

14:15.330 --> 14:18.360
如果你指"公司"是为了拯救世界
if the truth is that the company is all about saving the world,

14:18.360 --> 14:19.730
我不相信
I don't buy it.

14:19.730 --> 14:23.960
如果我母亲在"公司"如此才华出众
and if my mother is so brilliant and active in the company,

14:23.960 --> 14:25.800
你想让我干吗
what do you want with me?

14:25.800 --> 14:30.060
一个全球性功能全面的
a fully functioning scylla project would exist

14:30.060 --> 14:31.060
"锡拉"工程
on a global scale.

14:31.060 --> 14:34.100
单凭一个人是做不到的
it can't be managed by one person.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.230
但两个
but two...

14:36.230 --> 14:41.430
心有灵犀的天才
equally formidable, working in lockstep?

14:41.430 --> 14:43.630
绝对没问题
absolutely.

14:43.630 --> 14:45.530
想法很好
that's very good.

14:45.530 --> 14:49.360
你什么都想到了
you've clearly thought of everything.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.560
迈克尔
michael...

14:53.330 --> 14:55.660
如果我在骗你
if i weren't telling you the truth,

14:55.660 --> 15:00.190
我又怎么能拿到这个东西
how would i have gotten this?

15:59.390 --> 16:03.660
她只是个和罪犯交往的傻妞
this is just a stupid girl who dates a criminal.

16:03.660 --> 16:04.730
完全是浪费时间
this is a waste of time.

16:04.730 --> 16:08.000
布伦斯的领导风范
a signature of burrows' leadership.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.260
我们要调整一下
all right, we need to make a shift.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.660
巴格维尔  我现在告诉你
bagwell, i'm telling you right now,

16:10.660 --> 16:12.700
如果你在我行动时手软
if i make my play and you go soft,

16:12.700 --> 16:14.330
我就把你扔下阳台
i will sail you off that loft balcony

16:14.330 --> 16:15.760
鬼都不会关心
and no one will bat an eye.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.500
我的目标很明确  唐
my aim is true, don.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.700
相信我
keep it in your pants.

16:18.700 --> 16:22.330
我相信你  行了吧
i'll keep it in my pants, all right?

16:22.330 --> 16:24.830
更改体制的回报  说声"是"
all right, all in favor of changing the regime, say "aye."

16:24.830 --> 16:26.260
是  长官
aye, aye, captain.

16:26.260 --> 16:30.800
好的  那布伦斯就滚蛋了
aye. all right, burrows is out.

16:32.390 --> 16:35.360
很好  发过来
good, great. send it.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.960
"公司"在传蒂亚的信用卡记录
the company's e-mailing tia's credit card history.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.860
我越来越觉得这是内部工作
you know, i'm thinking more and more that this is an inside job.

16:43.860 --> 16:46.530
-为什么  -有几个理由
-why?  -a couple reasons.

16:46.530 --> 16:48.230
他带到见面地点的设备
the hardware he brought to the meet.

16:48.230 --> 16:49.860
能当场读出"锡拉"的内容
he could read scylla right on the spot.

16:49.860 --> 16:51.930
自从他消失后
since he's disappeared,

16:51.930 --> 16:54.130
我应该能找到他  但却不行
i should be able to find this man, and i can't.

16:54.130 --> 16:56.030
通常找不到的人  就是"公司"的
people you can't find are usually company.

16:56.030 --> 16:57.560
那又怎么样
how does that change anything?

16:57.560 --> 16:58.560
不怎样
it doesn't.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.630
只是一切更难了
it just makes everything harder.

17:05.030 --> 17:07.000
林肯
lincoln...

17:07.960 --> 17:10.560
我们什么时候才能开始
when are we going to get this out of the way?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.060
什么
what?

17:12.060 --> 17:14.130
我一生诱惑了那么多男人
of all the mercenary humps i've thrown at guys

17:14.130 --> 17:17.800
我也该得到我心仪的那个
in my lifetime, i think i'm due for one i want.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.030
别自作多情了
don't flatter yourself.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.600
太晚了
too late.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.630
说出来吧
name it.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.600
任何事都可以
and i do mean anything.

17:33.630 --> 17:35.460
屁都没找到
an ol' fat load of nothin'!

17:35.460 --> 17:39.160
什么都没有
a big ol' goose egg.

17:39.160 --> 17:43.100
啥都没有  旧通讯录  旧照片
nothing. old address books, photographs,

17:43.100 --> 17:44.430
电脑上的硬盘
hard drive from her computer.

17:44.430 --> 17:45.930
我查了她的邮件和网站
i checked her e-mails and her web sites.

17:45.930 --> 17:47.330
没有任何我们想要的信息
there's nothing from our guy.

17:47.330 --> 17:49.360
你确定查这女的有用吗
are you sure this girlfriend route is the way to go here?

17:49.360 --> 17:51.100
因为我开始觉得  我们在做无用功
because this is starting to feel like a wasted trip.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.500
"公司"要多久才能把
how long is it gonna take the company

17:52.500 --> 17:53.900
里面的东西读出来
to pull everything off this thing?

17:53.900 --> 17:55.160
几小时吧
a couple hours.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.530
行了  林肯  不如这样
all right, linc, this is the deal.

17:57.530 --> 17:59.030
我们很感激你的努力
look, we appreciate your effort,

17:59.030 --> 18:01.360
但我和巴格维尔做了次表决
but bagwell and i took a vote,

18:01.360 --> 18:05.430
我们在福州行动  但你的能力不够
and this being florida and all, you came up a little bit short.

18:05.430 --> 18:06.600
什么意思
meaning?

18:06.600 --> 18:07.930
你不是一把手
you're not in charge.

18:07.930 --> 18:08.700
那谁是
who is?

18:08.700 --> 18:10.290
-他  -没错
him. yeah.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.630
莽夫行事的方式
the bull-in-the-china-shop routine

18:11.630 --> 18:13.130
可能在你偷东西时管用
might have worked when you were stealing gumballs,

18:13.130 --> 18:15.900
但我们现在都虎落平阳
but our asses are on the line now, okay?

18:15.900 --> 18:17.330
而且都和将军达成协议
and we all have deals with the general.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.360
所以只能这样
so that's the way it's gonna be.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.830
况且  连格雷琴都没有帮你说话
and if you notice, even gretchen hasn't leapt to your defense.

18:21.830 --> 18:24.130
林肯  就让他当头吧
linc, just let him wear his crown.

18:24.130 --> 18:26.230
如果他没想过把东西卖了就行
i would if i thought he wasn't gonna sell this thing.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.330
只是我一个人这么想过吗
oh, what, am i the only one who's thought about that?

18:28.330 --> 18:29.430
林肯  听着
look, here's the deal, linc.

18:29.430 --> 18:30.860
到时候  会让你当当头
at some point, you'll have a vote.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.290
但是在那之前  你没戏了
but until then, you're done, all right?

18:32.290 --> 18:33.360
我们不听你的了
we're shuttin' you down, okay?

18:33.360 --> 18:35.230
你不是头头了
you're no longer in charge.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.160
看来又得重新投票了
uh-oh, looks like there's been a recount.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.430
来的不是时候
bad time?

18:46.430 --> 18:49.660
不  正是时候
no, perfect.

18:53.060 --> 18:57.100
你再不听从我的指挥
the second you stop doing what i tell you to do,

18:57.100 --> 18:59.830
我就毙了你
i'm gonna blow your brains out.

19:13.300 --> 19:14.870
把她找回来
bring her back.

19:14.870 --> 19:17.330
这次不一样
it's not gonna be the same.

19:18.270 --> 19:20.130
想起什么了吗
stir any memories?

19:23.570 --> 19:28.800
我当时十岁  我们去杰克逊洞野营
i was ten. we were on a camping trip in jackson hole.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.270
钓鱼  远足
fishing, hiking.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.830
一家人围坐在篝火旁
family huddled under a blanket in front of the bonfire.

19:33.830 --> 19:35.030
你可以停了
you can stop now.

19:35.030 --> 19:37.300
为什么  因为两年后这一切都消失了
why? because two years later it was gone?

19:37.300 --> 19:40.630
相片中的四个人
you know, three of the four

19:40.630 --> 19:42.370
有三个都还活着
people in this photograph are still alive.

19:42.370 --> 19:43.960
你想说什么
so what are you suggesting,

19:43.960 --> 19:45.730
让我拿起鱼竿
grab my fishing pole?

19:45.730 --> 19:48.900
为全家在怀俄明州重聚准备吗
time for a...a family reunion in wyoming?

19:48.900 --> 19:51.030
你想去哪都行
or wherever you like.

19:51.030 --> 19:53.870
别告诉我  你不希望实现这个
don't tell me it's something you haven't wished for.

19:53.870 --> 19:58.170
我所希望的  都是不现实的东西
i wished for a lot of unrealistic things.

19:58.170 --> 20:00.430
我也已经忘了
i got over them, too.

20:00.430 --> 20:01.870
为什么
why,

20:01.870 --> 20:05.470
我们可以让它变成现实
when we can make this happen?

20:06.370 --> 20:10.470
这些照片随时随地都可以拍
these pictures could have been taken anywhere at any time.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.770
在你进监狱前
before you were incarcerated,

20:11.770 --> 20:14.830
每周年祭  你都会去她墓碑前看她
you'd go to visit her grave on the anniversary

20:14.830 --> 20:16.130
够了  别说了
all right, enough.

20:16.130 --> 20:17.870
你会带一束蓝色鸢尾
you'd bring a bouquet of blue irises.

20:17.870 --> 20:18.900
在那里坐一小时
you'd sit for an hour.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.130
别说了
i said stop it.

20:20.130 --> 20:21.230
离开时  会拿一朵
when you'd leave, you'd take a flower

20:21.230 --> 20:22.700
别在翻领上
and pin it to your lapel.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.130
她每年都看你这么做
she watched you do this every year.

20:24.130 --> 20:25.400
她看到了你所背负的痛苦
she's seen the pain you carry.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.430
她想弥补
she wants to make amends.

20:26.430 --> 20:28.300
够了
all right!

20:28.930 --> 20:32.030
你是做了不少功课  真有你的
so you did a little digging. good for you.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.000
但你说的都是谎言
but everything out of your mouth is a lie,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.500
我一个字都不相信
and i don't believe a word of it.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.730
你省省吧
so let's just stop.

20:41.730 --> 20:44.470
别再说了
let's just stop.

20:47.470 --> 20:49.100
这是蒂亚的住址
that's tia's address

20:49.100 --> 20:51.670
查看一下
right there. pull it up.

20:52.370 --> 20:56.130
她住在这  工作地点在这  但是昨天
all right, she lives here, works here, but yesterday

20:56.130 --> 20:57.870
中午时分  她在蓝鸟酒吧
she used her credit card to buy a drink

20:57.870 --> 20:59.100
用信用卡买了点酒
at the pelican club a little after noon,

20:59.100 --> 21:00.930
1点左右  去礼品店
and then she picked up something at the gift shop

21:00.930 --> 21:02.230
买了些东西
a little after 1:00.

21:02.230 --> 21:04.130
等他男友下船
waiting for her boyfriend to debark.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.860
是上岸
disembark.

21:06.570 --> 21:07.630
-那他已经在城里了  -对
he's already in town. yeah.

21:07.630 --> 21:10.100
那他应该住在港口
then he lives in the marina.

21:10.100 --> 21:13.630
这也可能是另一个内部工作的原因
or this is another reason to think it's an inside job.

21:13.630 --> 21:15.470
如果他和"公司"的人工作
if he's working with someone from the company,

21:15.470 --> 21:17.900
他们不会希望名字出现在航空乘客名单上
they wouldn't want their names on any flight manifests.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.330
没错  他们想暗中
all right, they're trying to get scylla

21:19.330 --> 21:20.730
将"锡拉"用船运出境
out of the country by boat undetected.

21:20.730 --> 21:22.730
我们走
let's go.

21:22.730 --> 21:24.330
阿历克斯
alex, yeah?

21:24.330 --> 21:27.430
谢谢你能来
thanks for coming when you did, man.

21:27.430 --> 21:32.930
你信守诺言帮过我  我欠你的
you helped me like you said you would. i owe you.

22:17.130 --> 22:18.700
由我来谈
okay, i'll do the talking.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.100
你们在这里等
you guys wait here.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.470
阿历克斯  我们走
alex, let's go.

22:25.700 --> 22:26.870
下午好
afternoon.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.170
你好吗
how's it going?

22:28.170 --> 22:29.900
能帮你们什么吗
what can i do you for?

22:29.900 --> 22:30.830
认得她吗
recognize her?

22:30.830 --> 22:32.700
她叫蒂亚·海顿
her name's tia hayden.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.000
不认识
can't say i do. wish i did.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.470
长得倒挺漂亮
nice little tomato there.

22:36.470 --> 22:38.370
她昨天和一个男人来过
she was in here yesterday with a man.

22:38.370 --> 22:39.800
帮不了你们
can't help.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.370
抱歉
sorry.

22:42.370 --> 22:44.730
我是唐·赛尔夫  国安局的
don self, homeland security.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.670
这是我搭档布鲁斯·雷布拉奇
and this is my partner bruce liberace.

22:46.670 --> 22:48.470
没什么关系
no relation.

22:48.470 --> 22:50.330
我们正和外资调控部门合作
our department is working with the office

22:50.330 --> 22:52.030
听说过吗
of foreign assets control. have you heard of them?

22:52.030 --> 22:53.400
听过
yep.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.830
相信你也听过  我们在调查
I bet you have. we're looking into smuggling

22:54.830 --> 22:57.670
古巴雪茄走私案
and contraband transportation of cuban cigars.

22:57.670 --> 22:59.960
我发誓  这里没有
none here, swear to god.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.830
行了  那得我们说了算
all right, well, that's for us to decide.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.330
大概要一周
it's going to take about a week,

23:03.330 --> 23:05.430
在此期间你要关门大吉
and it's going to involve shutting down this entire marina...

23:05.430 --> 23:06.330
没错
oh, yeah.

23:06.330 --> 23:07.400
一个星期
...for about a week.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.700
-或者  -她来过
or... she was here

23:08.700 --> 23:12.060
和你们说的那个人一起
with that guy you were talking about.

23:12.060 --> 23:14.770
他想知道私人船只停在哪
he wanted to know which berth a private charter was docking in.

23:14.770 --> 23:17.000
他要我把船停远一点  我照办了
he asked me to move it further down the dock, which i did.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.870
避开海岸巡逻队
further away from the coast guard slip?

23:18.870 --> 23:21.500
我没问  我也没收钱
i didn't ask. and i didn't accept any money.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.100
如果他说付过款  那是骗人的
if he said he paid me, he's lying.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.730
出发点呢
what's the point of departure?

23:24.730 --> 23:26.530
巴拿马的拿骚  双程
nassau, bahamas. round trip.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.870
什么时候抵达
when does it arrive?

23:27.870 --> 23:31.300
已经到了
arrived.

23:32.570 --> 23:35.370
各位好  我是唐·赛尔夫
hey, everybody! okay, my name is don self!

23:35.370 --> 23:37.400
国安局的
homeland security.

23:37.400 --> 23:41.230
我和同事都希望你们有个快乐安全的旅程
my colleagues and i are hoping that you guys have a wonderful

23:41.230 --> 23:43.630
但是
and safe trip. unfortunately,

23:43.630 --> 23:47.060
我们要快速进行一次行李检查
we're going to have to do a quick luggage check search.

23:47.060 --> 23:48.900
不会占用很多时间
shouldn't take more than a minute, folks.

23:48.900 --> 23:51.230
只请各位配合
your cooperation is all that's required.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.470
打开你的包
open your bags.

24:25.170 --> 24:26.930
跪下
get on your knees!

24:27.830 --> 24:30.470
"锡拉"在哪
where is it? where's scylla?

24:30.470 --> 24:32.970
里面是什么
what have you got in here?

24:34.960 --> 24:38.170
3卷大麻
three joints.

24:44.770 --> 24:46.330
我还在服缓刑
i'm on probation.

24:46.330 --> 24:49.200
我会被抓回监狱吗
is this going to send me back?

24:54.270 --> 24:56.030
给自己做个头盔  老弟
make yourself a helmet, pal.

24:56.030 --> 24:59.730
就像小时候那样
just like old times.

25:02.770 --> 25:04.200
把她找回来
bring her back.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.170
你知道我做不到
you know i can't do that.

25:06.170 --> 25:10.600
我的能力有限
but, look, there's some stuff that i can do.

25:10.600 --> 25:11.770
这次不一样
it's not going to be the same,

25:11.770 --> 25:14.130
但我们会弄明白的
but we're going to figure it out.

25:14.130 --> 25:15.700
无论如何
and, no matter what,

25:15.700 --> 25:18.270
我们都会在一起
it's still going to be me and you.

25:18.700 --> 25:22.470
我很高兴你在山上过得开心
i am thrilled that you're enjoying your trip to the mountains,

25:22.470 --> 25:24.960
但这可不是度假
but it's not an open-ended vacation.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.570
斯科菲尔德现在身心疲惫  精神沮丧
scofield's exhausted. despondent.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.300
很抗拒  但也是个典型弃儿
he's very resistant, but a classic abandoned child.

25:30.300 --> 25:31.300
他会屈服的
he'll come around.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.800
需要多久  医生
time frame, doctor?

25:32.800 --> 25:36.000
不用药的话  3天
unaided, three days.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.500
如果用喷妥撒呢
with the pentothal?

25:37.500 --> 25:41.730
会快些  但这相当于药物叶切断术
sooner, but it's nearly a chemical lobotomy.

25:42.430 --> 25:44.960
如果他能自愿归顺  那将是他的决心
but, if he turns on his own, it'll be his decision,

25:44.960 --> 25:46.370
他的思维
his reasoning.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.430
他就能永远归顺我们
we'll own him forever.

25:48.430 --> 25:50.500
斯科菲尔德很狡猾
scofield's squirrelly.

25:50.500 --> 25:53.000
不经过历练  我是不会相信他的
i won't trust him till he walks hot coals.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.600
我相信能让他转变
i think i can get him there.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.200
很好  但如果
good. but, if

25:57.200 --> 26:00.060
我发现你被他耍了  医生
i find out he's been playing you, doctor,

26:00.060 --> 26:02.470
你也会接受跟他一样的叶切断术
you'll get the same lobotomy as scofield.

26:02.470 --> 26:06.760
尽快搞定
just get it done.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.060
快走
Let's go.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.760
快上车
In the van.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.760
开车
Go.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.820
如果解开手铐后  你有什么举动
if you fight when those cuffs are off,

27:16.820 --> 27:18.390
警卫们不会手下留情
the guards will stomp the life out of you.

27:18.390 --> 27:22.050
知道了
yeah.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.120
抱歉  行动粗鲁了些
forgive the dramatics.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.220
不能让"公司"知道我们见面
the company can't know i'm talking to you.

27:30.220 --> 27:32.590
你就是"公司"的人  你是他女儿
you are the company. you're his daughter.

27:32.590 --> 27:34.060
你还想不想找到迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
do you want to find michael scofield?

27:34.060 --> 27:36.150
当然想
of course i do.

27:39.060 --> 27:40.790
他就在60英里外
it's 60 miles northeast

27:40.790 --> 27:42.960
市区的东北边  最好快点行动
of downtown. i'd move quickly.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.290
他们对他做了什么
what are they doing to him?

27:44.290 --> 27:46.820
请他喝柠檬汁
having lemonade.

27:47.350 --> 27:49.290
他们想改造他的思想
they're carving out his personality.

27:49.290 --> 27:50.320
这就是他们招募的方式
that's how they recruit.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.820
你这是在设计我
or you're setting me up.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.220
秘密战虽不光彩
clandestine warfare isn't pretty,

27:55.220 --> 27:56.590
但交战规则
but the rules of engagement

27:56.590 --> 27:58.350
不包括折磨和杀戮无辜者
don't include killing and torturing the innocent.

27:58.350 --> 28:00.020
至少我不会
at least not for me.

28:00.020 --> 28:03.520
迈克尔正在进行快速洗脑
michael is the object of a quick and nasty

28:03.520 --> 28:06.760
而你在浪费时间
process, and you're wasting time.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.560
走吧
out.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.220
快
out.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.350
我们要安全摄像头的录像
we need the footage from that security camera.

28:22.350 --> 28:23.920
无意冒犯二位  但我
not to offend either of you, but i took

28:23.920 --> 28:25.460
打电话找了律师
the liberty of calling my attorney

28:25.460 --> 28:28.320
询问你们的权利范围
to find out exactly what the scope of your authority is here,

28:28.320 --> 28:32.260
-他告诉我  -只管交出来  行吧
- and he tells me... - just get the tape, all right?

28:33.660 --> 28:35.260
好
Sure

28:39.520 --> 28:40.660
或者我们漏掉了"锡拉"
either we missed scylla...

28:40.660 --> 28:42.890
不可能漏掉
no, no, no. we did not miss scylla.

28:42.890 --> 28:43.920
我们翻了每一个包
we searched every bag.

28:43.920 --> 28:47.390
也许买家已经在船上了
then maybe the buyer was already on the boat,

28:47.390 --> 28:49.320
也要上岸  是吧
and was disembarking, right?

28:49.320 --> 28:52.560
如果他们不想在航空乘客名单上留下名字
i mean, if they don't want their names on any flight manifest,

28:52.560 --> 28:54.290
他们也许会偷溜上去
maybe they just eased back on in.

28:54.290 --> 28:56.490
那也不是最糟的
that wouldn't be the worst news.

28:56.490 --> 28:57.820
意味着他们在迈阿密
that means they're in miami.

28:57.820 --> 28:58.070
好
Right.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.810
戴上你那不光彩的徽章  到船上去
So get yourself back down with your disgraced badge to steamboat willie,

29:01.810 --> 29:05.820
让他把船上每个人的名字都供出来
And have him cough up every name of every person on that boat coming off.

29:05.820 --> 29:06.900
行啊  很好
Okay, that's good,

29:06.900 --> 29:10.100
他们可能从巴哈马坐低等船
Because they probably would have traveled in on a

29:10.100 --> 29:14.720
而且用真名过来  对吗
Low-grade charter from the bahamas, and used their real names, right?

29:14.720 --> 29:16.720
计划真不错
That would be a good plan.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.690
他还好吗
How is he?

29:18.690 --> 29:20.960
他还活着
He's alive.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.060
我们拿到"锡拉"后
So we get scylla.

29:24.060 --> 29:27.020
我们就自由了  潘姆  还有LJ
Then we're free, all of us-- pam, lj...

29:27.020 --> 29:29.660
突然之间  "公司"有良心了吗
All of a sudden, the company grew a heart?

29:29.660 --> 29:30.920
他们也对我们厌烦了
They're just tired of us.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.990
他们只想要回"锡拉"
They want scylla back. that's it.

29:32.990 --> 29:35.690
我们从来没有他们真正想要的东西
Then we never really had anything they wanted.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.820
没错  我们现在有筹码了
Exactly. now we got leverage.

29:40.350 --> 29:43.290
现在还没有
We don't have it yet.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.890
有发现吗
Anything?

29:49.890 --> 29:52.220
没有
No.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.760
还没有
Nothing yet.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.820
没有
Nothing.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.660
林肯  你不明白
No, lincoln, you don't understand.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.320
她说招募的方式  让我很担心
The way she said "recruit" made my stomach turn.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.350
他们会折磨他的
They're going to torture him.

30:03.350 --> 30:07.320
我们拿到"锡拉"前  他至少能照顾自己一天
He can take care of himself, at least for one day, until we get scylla.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.790
林肯  他得待在加护病房
Lincoln, he needs to be in the icu.

30:09.790 --> 30:10.960
你有什么计划
What's your plan?

30:10.960 --> 30:12.720
劫他出来吗
Break him out?

30:12.720 --> 30:14.390
我不知道  我没有计划
I don't know. I don't have one.

30:14.390 --> 30:16.660
那你只是给他和我们带来危险
Well, you're putting him and us at risk.

30:16.660 --> 30:19.890
我们回洛城之前  你就待在宾馆里
Just stay in the hotel until we get back to l.a.

30:19.890 --> 30:21.820
好吗
All right?

30:37.890 --> 30:40.720
唐克雷蒂找到她的白马王子了
Tancredi got the location of her shining knight.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.350
她现在可能去找他了
She may be heading there now.

30:42.350 --> 30:44.090
做得好  巴格维尔
Exemplary, bagwell.

30:44.090 --> 30:45.330
谢谢夸奖  先生
Thank you, sir.

30:45.330 --> 30:52.290
说话要算话  不是想唠叨  我只是想
A deal's a deal, right? not to be a broken record, but all I ask...

31:00.960 --> 31:04.350
将军  我认为我们这里有实质性进展
But I think we're making some real progress, general.

31:04.350 --> 31:07.070
斯布家族对"公司"而言  虽是一笔财富
The scofield/burrows family would have been a formidable asset to the

31:07.070 --> 31:12.860
但他的人执意捣乱  我们就要采取行动
Company, but since his lapdog insists on complicating matters, we move on.

31:12.860 --> 31:14.720
将军  我们能搞定一个女人
General, we can handle a lone female.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.160
没错  是只有一个
If, indeed, that's what we're dealing with.

31:17.160 --> 31:21.020
但根据我的经验  一个人会引来很多人
But it's my experience, that with the one comes many.

31:21.020 --> 31:22.560
现在就动手  医生
Do it now, doctor.

31:22.560 --> 31:25.520
还要一小时  他刚吃饭  我不想让他吐
I need an hour. he just ate. I don't want him to aspirate.

31:25.520 --> 31:28.990
马上  医生
Now, doctor.

31:28.990 --> 31:31.690
我要斯科菲尔德能顺利转移
I want scofield pliable for transit.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.990
你的车20分钟后到
Your vehicle arrives in 20 minutes.

31:33.990 --> 31:35.990
万一我们不能使他苏醒呢
And if we can't revive him?

31:35.990 --> 31:40.260
那就认命
C'est la vie!

31:51.420 --> 31:55.220
迈克尔  出来  我们谈谈
Michael, come out. we need to talk.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.880
给自己做个头盔  老弟
make yourself a helmet, pal.

32:14.780 --> 32:16.780
没错
That's it!

32:18.210 --> 32:19.710
就是他
That's our guy!

32:19.710 --> 32:22.880
蒂亚就在他旁边
There's tia right beside him.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.440
我们把图像导出来  交给"公司"
We've got to pull that image, get it to the company,

32:24.440 --> 32:25.280
让他们找出他
And have them match it.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.080
格雷琴去哪了
Where's gretchen?

32:58.380 --> 33:00.580
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

33:02.020 --> 33:03.500
能发现你的照片
Once I found your mug shot,

33:03.500 --> 33:07.750
再找你的手机号就不难了
It really wasn't that hard getting your legit cell number.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.250
我现在来了
well, now i'm here.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.680
你想怎样
what do you want?

33:11.680 --> 33:13.810
你在洛城一直不要求支援
you never bothered to ask back in los angeles

33:13.810 --> 33:16.010
一心只想杀了我
you were too busy planning on killing me

33:16.010 --> 33:17.810
但事实上  我为"公司"工作
but i actually worked for the company.

33:17.810 --> 33:19.680
我知道你是谁
i know who you are.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.350
我再问一次
and i'll ask it again.

33:22.350 --> 33:24.480
你想怎样
what do you want?

33:24.480 --> 33:26.050
解决你的问题  斯科特

33:26.050 --> 33:30.150
这是我今天的头等大事
i mean, it is what gets me up out of bed in the morning.

33:30.150 --> 33:33.280
你有大麻烦
you have a big problem, and so does

33:33.280 --> 33:35.050
你的老板也一样
whoever it is you're working for.

33:35.050 --> 33:36.310
你肯定知道
and you obviously know that

33:36.310 --> 33:38.050
要不就不会来见我了
or you wouldn't have graced me with your presence.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.050
你可以搞定吗
and you can make that problem disappear?

33:40.050 --> 33:41.680
又快又彻底
quickly and completely.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.640
但要额外好处
with an extra added bonus.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.210
或者说  大有好处
crucial, i might add.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.610
然后我会编个故事
i then feed the company a story

33:49.610 --> 33:50.850
让"公司"的人到别处找你
that has them looking elsewhere.

33:50.850 --> 33:52.610
也就说你很有价值
meaning you're invaluable

33:52.610 --> 33:54.450
-求我别杀你  -对
and please don't kill you. yeah.

33:54.450 --> 33:57.480
但不用求
without the "please."

33:57.710 --> 33:59.280
你要多少钱
how much?

33:59.280 --> 34:00.680
很多
a lot.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.780
我跟你说话时  你不看着我
and it's about to double here in a second

34:02.780 --> 34:06.010
我就要求双倍的钱
if you don't look at me when i'm talking to you.

34:07.850 --> 34:10.280
去和你老板商量
you go run and talk it over with your boss.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.580
定了数目再给我电话
call me with a number.

34:12.580 --> 34:15.210
我可以代表他们跟你谈
i'm authorized to negotiate on their behalf.

34:15.210 --> 34:17.310
如果你帮我

34:17.310 --> 34:20.580
除掉追查我们的人  并能让"公司"找不到我们
whoever's looking for us and get the company off our scent--

34:20.580 --> 34:23.950
一千万
$10 million.

34:24.180 --> 34:26.880
最终价格

34:26.880 --> 34:29.640
多要一分钱
ask for a penny more and i'll shoot you

34:29.640 --> 34:32.340
我就杀了你
in the chest and take my chances.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.450
别紧张  迈克尔
take it easy, michael.

34:49.450 --> 34:51.910

what was that?

34:55.150 --> 34:56.350
好像是热水器
sounded like the water heater.

34:56.350 --> 34:59.280
卫生间传来的

35:12.780 --> 35:14.710
捡起来
