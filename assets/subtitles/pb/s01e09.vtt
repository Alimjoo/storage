WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:04.800
把这个地方想像成美国地图
Think of this place like a map of the US.

00:04.810 --> 00:07.340
我们的牢房那边  那是纽约城
Our cell over there, that's New York City.

00:07.350 --> 00:09.950
医务室 我们的出口  是加利福尼亚
The infirmary, our exit, that's California.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.530
我们脚下连接两边的管道...
The pipes beneath us that connect the two...

00:12.540 --> 00:14.380
-66号公路  -我们要离开的必经之路
-Route 66.  -Our ticket out of here.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.850
66公路直接在那个房子下面经过
Route 66 runs beneath that building.

00:16.860 --> 00:19.640
那是管道上方的唯一建筑
It's the only building sitting on top of those tunnels.

00:19.650 --> 00:22.770
我们要做的就是以P.I.的身份进里面去
All we gotta do is get in there,on PI,

00:22.780 --> 00:25.280
给我们自己挖个出口
and dig ourselves an onramp.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.740
-在哪?  -就这
-Which one?  -Right there.

00:27.850 --> 00:30.710
这里4英尺下面连接主管道
This goes down four feet.Connects to the main line below.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.230
我们要做的就是加宽它
All we've gotta do is widen it

00:32.240 --> 00:35.180
这样66号公路就有了出口
and we've got ourselves an onramp to Route 66.

00:35.190 --> 00:36.480
我要弄清楚
I'm gonna find out, you know,

00:36.490 --> 00:38.020
你在上面干什么
what it is you're doing up there.

00:38.030 --> 00:39.620
你说你到天花板上去
You told me that you had been up

00:39.630 --> 00:43.380
是为了P.I.的工作 但...
in the crawlspace for PI,

00:43.390 --> 00:45.460
P.I.从来没有派过这样的任务
and PI was never assigned to go there.

00:45.470 --> 00:46.680
我们给你...
We got you...

00:46.690 --> 00:48.880
一个小礼物
a little get well gift.

00:48.890 --> 00:51.340
你叫什么?
What's your name?

00:51.700 --> 00:53.930
发生了一起爆炸事故
There was an explosion.

00:53.940 --> 00:55.910
煤气管道爆炸  里面所有人都死了
Gas line. Everyone inside was killed.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.000
我们对抗的这伙人  不把我们干掉不会罢休的
These people won't stop until we're dead.

00:58.010 --> 00:59.230
我们不能永远躲下去
We can't hide forever.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.720
那个孩子呢  据说杀了父母的那个?
How about that kid?The one killed his parents?

01:01.730 --> 01:03.310
-哦  他被抓了  -真的?
Oh, they got him. -They did?

01:03.320 --> 01:04.180
他已经在看管之下
He's in custody.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.290
我知道你的样子  你这狗杂种!
I know what you look like, you son of a bitch.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.750
菲利·法尔曾
Philly Falzone.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.490
你知道这里有人知道他的下落
Word is someone knows where Fibonacci is

01:10.500 --> 01:13.180
无论如何也要想办法
and you're not doing anything about it.

01:20.060 --> 01:22.460
帮帮我
Help me.

01:23.870 --> 01:25.670
求你了
Please.

01:35.100 --> 01:38.160
你要原谅这个孩子
You'll have to forgive my boy.

01:38.170 --> 01:44.160
他老是做些不应该做的事
He has the propensity to be a bit gregarious when he shouldn't be.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.870
在监狱的浴室总是感到很害怕
Fraternising in the prison shower. Come on.

01:46.870 --> 01:49.990
也许你该让他歇一会
Maybe you oughta cut the kid a break.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.520
你是不是对我的行为有意见啊  你没这么蠢吧
You wouldn't be meddling in my affairs,now, would you?You can't be that stupid.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.330
现在我跟你算是同一条船上的人了
Not while I'm so fully invested in your affairs.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.600
这是你们两个之间的事  与我无关
What's between you and him is between you and him.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.800
我就这个意思
That's what I thought you said.

02:23.070 --> 02:26.950
你一定要帮我
You've gotta help me.

02:32.850 --> 02:34.810
你一定要帮我
You gotta help me.

02:34.820 --> 02:37.140
你找错人了  这是警察的事
You talk to the wrong man.This is a matter for the police.

02:37.150 --> 02:38.580
我说的可是我儿子
This is my son we're talking about.

02:38.590 --> 02:41.080
看在上帝的份上  他失踪了  帮帮我!
For god say,He's missing. Do something!

02:41.090 --> 02:44.760
你必须明白 我只是个监狱的狱长
You have got to understand,I am the warden of a prison.

02:44.770 --> 02:46.130
牵涉到法律问题
When it comes to the law,

02:46.140 --> 02:48.150
我完全无能为力
absolutely there is nothing I can do.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.940
外面发生的事完全超出我的权力范围
Whatever happens is out of my jurisdiction

02:50.950 --> 02:52.340
除非事情在里面
until it comes through those gates.

02:52.350 --> 02:55.090
这就是里面的事!  放我出去!
It just did. Let me out.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.950
-什么?  -让我去找他
-What?  -Let me find him.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.380
我了解他的想法  我知道他会去哪
I know how he thinks.I know where he'd run.

02:59.390 --> 03:00.660
布伦斯  现在跟你说清楚
I'd have thought

03:00.670 --> 03:04.890
以目前的情况  你应该清楚自己是个死囚
by now you'd understand your position as a death row inmate.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.510
这个忙我绝对帮不了
There is no way I can honour that request.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.060
你说谎.你有这权力
That ain't true.You get the power.

03:10.070 --> 03:13.200
如果犯人家属有紧急情况  你可以批准假释
In case of a family emergency,you can grant an inmate supervised leave.

03:13.210 --> 03:18.040
你儿子现在是杀人案的首要嫌疑人!
Your son is a prime suspect in a double homicide.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.780
你以为来干什么的  午休?
What do you think this is, a siesta?

03:38.790 --> 03:43.800
看到没有?看到我的脸在上面没有?  知道这是什么意思吗?
You see that? You see my face up there?Any idea how it got there?

03:43.810 --> 03:45.840
工作积极性
Work ethic.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.920
这个词在你们国家有什么意义吗?
Those two words mean anything in your country?

03:48.930 --> 03:51.380
你是狱工  在这里可不允许偷懒
You're on PI, so quit slow-walking me.

03:51.390 --> 03:52.940
下次就不只是警告了
I'm not gonna warn you again.

03:52.950 --> 03:56.620
看什么?!
What are you looking at?

04:26.420 --> 04:29.540
狱警发现碎块  就会知道我们在挖洞
The bulls find this stuff,they'll know we're digging.

04:29.550 --> 04:32.330
所以我们要把这些处理掉...
That's why we gotta get rid of it.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.650
每次一小块
One piece at a time.

05:19.630 --> 05:22.710
新人来了
Freshmen.

05:30.140 --> 05:32.450
装得酷一点  伙计
Best put on ourjail face, BG.

05:32.460 --> 05:37.290
那些家伙看到你愁眉苦脸  会把你烦到死的
These crabs see you puckering,they bitchify you in a heartbeat.

06:01.950 --> 06:04.330
看来我现在得给你换个称呼了
I gotta find something else to call you now.

06:04.340 --> 06:06.750
-为什么?  -因为你现在不是"嫩鸡"了
-Why's that?  -Cos you ain't a fish no more.

06:06.760 --> 06:11.120
你现在不是监狱里最新的人...
You ain't the newest con in the tank.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.200
我本来可以帮他的
I could've done something.

07:00.210 --> 07:07.040
不  帝博格掌握那孩子的生死  你无能为力
No.T-Bag had his hooks in that kid.There was nothing you could have done.

07:07.050 --> 07:08.960
我本可以告诉狱长
I could've told the Pope.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.860
他就会被送到隔离区  这样就不会有事了
He could've transferred the kid to ADSEG.Then he will be in safe.

07:11.870 --> 07:14.870
算了  迈克尔  你甚至都不认识他
Go easy, Michael. You didn't even know him.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.110
这样就能心安理得?
And that makes it OK?

07:18.320 --> 07:21.160
我因为怕惹麻烦而没去帮他
I turned my back on him because I didn't wanna make waves.

07:21.170 --> 07:27.590
因为更容易...所以...无视这些事情
It was just... easier to look the other way,

07:27.600 --> 07:31.790
-以保证计划的安全  -你做到了
-keep the plan safe. -And you did.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.120
以什么样的代价?
But at what price?

07:34.130 --> 07:37.070
妈妈可不是这样教我们的
That's not how she raised us.

07:37.080 --> 07:41.390
别人有难 就要伸出援手
A man's down, you give him your hand.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.420
如果她知道我成了这样的人  在坟墓里也会辗转反侧
She'd roll over in her grave if she knew.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.060
不  不会的
She wouldn't.

07:46.070 --> 07:48.830
你对我伸了援手  迈克尔
You've given me your hand, Michael.

07:48.840 --> 07:53.180
我儿子在外面危在旦夕
My son's out there with a bull's eye on his back.

07:53.190 --> 07:58.840
无论如何我们也要出去  求你
Do whatever you gotta do to get us out of here. Please.

08:39.530 --> 08:42.400
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

08:42.410 --> 08:45.710
只是想找点咖啡
I was just looking for some coffee.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.920
对  没咖啡了
There isn't any.

08:47.930 --> 08:52.080
那些是我父亲的  如果你想知道的话
They belonged to my father,if you were wondering.

08:52.090 --> 08:54.130
在这放了多久了?
How long have they been in there?

08:54.140 --> 08:58.140
不知道 五年吧
I don't know. Five years?

08:59.990 --> 09:02.800
我跟你说  维罗妮卡  我们一起经历了那么多事
You know, Veronica, we've been through a lot

09:02.810 --> 09:05.700
而且 跟你一样我现在也心烦意乱
and I'm freaking out here as much as you are,

09:05.710 --> 09:08.360
但你看我的眼神有时候就像...
but you get this look in your eye sometimes like...

09:08.370 --> 09:10.190
就像我是坏人
like I'm the bad guy.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.940
我根本不了解你  尼克
I don't know who you are.

09:11.950 --> 09:14.920
你只是像穿着闪亮铠甲的骑士一样  突然出现
You just magically show up like some knight in shining armour.

09:14.930 --> 09:15.700
我今天才能没事
I'm really safe today.

09:15.710 --> 09:19.490
我...我觉得你忽视了一些东西
You know, I think you seem to be forgetting something here.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.520
我现在跟你一样处境危险
I'm in the cross hairs the same way you are,

09:21.530 --> 09:24.570
都是为了你的前男友  这个人不是我父亲 只是个囚犯
all for your ex-boyfriend, I'm not my father who is a scumbag criminal

09:24.580 --> 09:28.370
只是正好他被人陷害进了监狱
who just happens to be in prison for the one crime he didn't commit.

09:28.380 --> 09:31.270
我告诉你  我受够了这些事情
You know something? I got enough of my own crap to deal with.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.320
你要走就走
You wanna go, you go.

09:50.060 --> 09:51.950
不介意我跟着你混吧  古沙?
Mind if I lamp with you, cuzzo?

09:51.960 --> 09:54.400
滚蛋  小雪花(白人)
Roll, snowflake.

09:54.410 --> 09:55.890
伙计  我只是...
Hey, man, I'm just...

09:55.900 --> 09:59.880
我是新来的  明白?  我只是在找些伴儿
I'm just new, you know?I'm looking for some homies.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.260
我说了  滚!
I said roll.

10:02.270 --> 10:04.150
怎么了  我才刚到啊
Brother, I'm just launching.

10:04.160 --> 10:08.820
是吗  那就到一边去  小白
Yeah? Well, launch somewhere else,white boy.

10:09.660 --> 10:12.780
好的  伙计
All right, y'all.

10:12.790 --> 10:15.990
我自己会走的
I'm fitting to bounce.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.020
别激动
Peace.

10:22.970 --> 10:27.000
那个小子没意识到自己的肤色啊
Boy's a bit confused about his pigmentation,

10:27.010 --> 10:30.820
但他还是有勇气的  是吧
but he sure does have spunk, doesn't he?

10:36.450 --> 10:38.720
阿布鲁奇?
Abruzzi!

10:38.730 --> 10:42.980
-是?  -在干什么?
-Yeah?  -What are you doing?

10:43.760 --> 10:46.630
你说"在干什么?" 是什么意思?
What do you mean, what am I doing?

10:46.640 --> 10:49.760
月初就要到了  约翰
First of the month's coming up, John.

10:49.770 --> 10:54.650
-怎么?  -这个月的我没拿到
-Yeah? So? -I haven't got my monthly.

10:55.410 --> 10:57.420
-什么?  -我在网上查了我的帐户
-What? -I checked my balance.

10:57.430 --> 11:01.560
看起来严重赤字啊
It's looking deficient.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.570
肯定是有什么错误 比如结算问题
It's gotta be some kind of a mistake,like an accounting error.

11:07.580 --> 11:08.130
对.
Yeah.

11:08.140 --> 11:11.770
告诉法尔曾我不会接受  清算问题这种解释
Tell Falzone I don't stand for accounting errors.

11:11.780 --> 11:14.430
今天结束前我会回办公室
I'm going back into my office at the end of the day.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.530
再查我的收支情况
Gonna check my balance again.

11:16.540 --> 11:19.240
如果没解决的话...
If it's not up to where it's supposed to be,

11:19.250 --> 11:23.530
对你所有的照顾  比如负责P.I.
all these privileges you got,like running PI,

11:23.540 --> 11:27.160
都会消失
they're gone.

11:27.170 --> 11:30.240
搞定它  约翰
Get it done, John.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.450
-法尔曾公司  -找菲利
-Falzone Enterprises. -Get Philly.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.450
抱歉  法尔曾先生无法接电话
Mr Falzone's not available.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.840
你告诉他约翰·阿布鲁奇打来的
You tell him it's John Abruzzi calling.

11:36.850 --> 11:43.150
-对不起  我不知道是您...  -现在知道了?
-I'm sorry. I didn't realise. -Well, now you do.

11:45.210 --> 11:47.500
抱歉  他过会儿打给你
I'm sorry. He's gonna have to call you back.

11:47.510 --> 11:51.170
什么?  喂...
What?  Hey...

12:02.890 --> 12:07.160
对不起  关于刚才的事
I'm sorry. About before.

12:07.170 --> 12:10.650
大家都有压力  我知道
Pressure's getting to us, that's all.

12:10.850 --> 12:14.640
好消息是没人找的到我们 我父亲帮我们做到这点
Good news is nobody can reach us out here.My old man made sure of that.

12:14.650 --> 12:19.000
不要碰电话  还有井和发电机
Never even hooked up the telephone.Same with the well and the generator.

12:19.010 --> 12:22.530
我曾想他是个阴谋论怪人
I used to think he was some kind of conspiracy theory wacko.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.370
看来他是对的
Turns out maybe he was right.

12:24.380 --> 12:28.100
我不能留下  尼克  我要回去
I can't stay, Nick.I'll get back.

12:28.110 --> 12:31.650
他剩不到两个星期了
He's got less than two weeks.

12:31.660 --> 12:34.150
他称这个是关键领带
The old man called this his serious tie.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.960
只在他认为
He only wore it when he really,

12:36.970 --> 12:40.880
重要时才戴
really meant business.

12:41.530 --> 12:43.950
我们再露面会很危险
Be dangerous showing our faces again.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.250
除非他们不再找我们  他们认为我们已经死了  是吧?
Not if they're not looking for us.They think we're dead.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.930
我知道  但这样会持续很长吗?
Yeah, but how long is that gonna last?

12:49.940 --> 12:52.130
要迅速  灵活应对
Gotta be quick, be smart about it.

12:52.140 --> 12:53.980
依我看  我们只需要在一定范围调查
Wll,I see.We're just gonna be running in circles

12:53.990 --> 12:57.330
在行刑前找到无罪的证据
if we think we can find exculpatory evidence before the execution.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.590
证明他没做过
prove he didn't do it.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.790
我差不多和库克郡的每个检察官都交过手
I've gone up against every prosecutor in Cook County.

13:01.790 --> 13:03.650
一个男人被杀   他们第一个想联系的...
Man gets murdered, the first person they talk to

13:03.660 --> 13:08.120
他真正的敌人的妻子
to see who his enemies were, the wife.

13:08.130 --> 13:10.090
你要调查那个蜂王?
You wanna go after the queen bee herself?

13:10.100 --> 13:11.930
莱斯利·斯特德曼
Leslie Steadman.

13:11.940 --> 13:17.100
每个镇上的人都知道在勒星顿
Everyone in town knows the old bird lunches at the Lexington every day

13:17.110 --> 13:21.240
还有社会集合
with the society set.

13:26.210 --> 13:27.790
喂  慢点
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!Slow down!

13:27.800 --> 13:29.420
慢点!
Slow down.

13:29.430 --> 13:30.690
喂
Man,

13:30.700 --> 13:34.240
你哥会让我们都暴露的
your brother's gonna give us away.

13:35.990 --> 13:38.910
牛来了
Bull's coming.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.390
-所以人都出去  -什么?
-Everybody out. -What?

13:49.400 --> 13:51.200
我说了  所有人都出去!
I said everybody out.

13:51.210 --> 13:53.850
就现在
Now.

14:00.190 --> 14:03.340
快走
Move it!

14:04.410 --> 14:06.790
-去哪啊  -向前  走到墙角

在我去找你们前不要想动
And don't move a damn muscle till I come get you.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.770
去吧
Go!

14:12.780 --> 14:16.040
到底怎么了?
What the hell's going on?

14:21.030 --> 14:26.340
-我们太坏了  是吧?  -你太坏了  走吧
-We're so bad, aren't we? -You're damn skippy. Let's go.

14:29.340 --> 14:31.650
你下次应该多给点警报
You gotta give us more of a warning.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.340
对不起
I'm sorry.

14:33.350 --> 14:36.790
他突然出现
He just showed up.

14:38.570 --> 14:39.510
我们会被抓的
Oh, we're gonna get caught

14:39.520 --> 14:41.140
-被谁  -狱长
-by who? -by the warden.

14:41.150 --> 14:43.600
宝贝  现在  在这儿
Baby, right now,in this room,

14:43.610 --> 14:45.120
在这个时候
at this moment,

14:45.130 --> 14:48.900
我就... 是狱长.
I am the warden.

14:48.910 --> 14:50.480
-说啊  -我不会说的
-Then say it. -No.

14:50.490 --> 14:54.180
说吧
Come on, baby, say it.

14:54.190 --> 14:57.400
你就是狱长  路易斯!
You're the warden, Louis!

15:13.200 --> 15:16.740
这对婊子养的
The sneaky son of a bitch.

15:16.750 --> 15:20.020
你认为他发现那洞了
You think he found the hole?

15:23.070 --> 15:25.010
再移一寸他就会发现了
Another inch and he'd have found it.

15:25.020 --> 15:30.220
我们尽快得找点东西把洞口盖上
We need to find something to cover this hole ASAP.

15:30.280 --> 15:34.150
破产  你说破产是指什么
Broke. What do you mean, broke?

15:34.160 --> 15:35.790
公司
The C-Corp,

15:35.800 --> 15:37.550
投资帐户
the investment accounts,

15:37.560 --> 15:41.470
还有海边的百慕大鳄鱼产业
even the offshore stuff, Caymans, Bermuda...

15:41.480 --> 15:43.350
菲利也会把帐算清
Philly Falzone liquidated everything.

15:43.350 --> 15:47.920
我一开始就告诉过你   如果你惹我  下场会是如何
Hey, I told you from the beginning what would happen if you screwed me.

15:47.930 --> 15:49.630
我注意了
and I heeded it.

15:49.640 --> 15:53.140
这就是我一开始就警告过你  不要让菲利·鲍尔做你的律师
That's why I warned you from the get-go not to give Philly power of attorney.

15:53.150 --> 15:56.480
我们谈过的  记得吗
We had that conversation, remember?

15:56.490 --> 16:01.800
你实际剩下的钱就是  你妻子户头上的3万美元
Look, the only real funds you have left are the 30,000 in your wife's pocket account.

16:01.810 --> 16:05.210
-我现在可以...  -不要动那些钱  不要碰
-Now, I can...  -Don't. Don't touch that.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.880
除了我妻子以外谁也不能碰那笔钱
Nobody touches that but her.

16:07.890 --> 16:09.090
我要告诉她什么
What do I tell her?

16:09.100 --> 16:12.340
-你知道所有的事情吗  -什么也别告诉她
-You know, about all this? -Don't tell her anything,

16:12.350 --> 16:13.910
好吗
OK?

16:13.920 --> 16:15.990
破产声明马上就要到了
The statements are going to come.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.970
她会知道的   嘿  我告诉过你
She's going to know. Hey, I told you.

16:19.980 --> 16:24.110
别告诉她
Don't tell her.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.250
好吗
All right?

16:26.260 --> 16:30.290
有问题吗
You got a problem with that?

16:30.540 --> 16:33.400
没问题 约翰
OK, John.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.700
如果还有其他需要帮助的  你就联系我
You know where to contact me if you need anything else.

16:35.710 --> 16:39.440
有事的话你也可以找我
The same goes for you.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.740
嘿
Hey.

16:50.750 --> 16:53.250
嘿!
Hey!

16:55.770 --> 16:57.110
菲利
Philly.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.800
最近好吗
Aren't you?

16:59.810 --> 17:03.730
见到你真好  对于你答案永远是是的 菲利
So good to see you.For you, the answer's always yes, Philly.

17:03.740 --> 17:06.760
请坐
Sit down.

17:08.340 --> 17:09.870
坐
Sit.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.820
过来  约翰
Come on, John.

17:16.520 --> 17:22.810
代理的卫生组织或是首选供应商  列表上好像没有福克斯河药业的记录
There's no record of a Fox River medical practice on our list of participating HMOs or PPOs.

17:22.820 --> 17:24.920
是的  那是因为我们是州立监狱
That's because we're a state penitentiary

17:24.930 --> 17:27.900
而且我们这里情况特殊
and we're in kind of a unique situation here.

17:27.910 --> 17:32.280
斯科菲尔德先生的上一个老板  给他的保险还没有失效
Mr Scofield's insurance policy from his previous employer hasn't lapsed.

17:32.290 --> 17:36.870
所以州里命令你支付他的经费  而不是用纳税人的钱
The state's demanding that you pay for his treatment and not the taxpayers.

17:36.880 --> 17:37.580
好的
OK. Well,

17:37.590 --> 17:41.170
另外 听说他已经补上了免税的部分
it says here he already met his deductible.

17:41.180 --> 17:42.980
好的
OK.

17:42.990 --> 17:46.780
哦   不   等等  这是精神病类保险  不是常规类...
Oh, no, wait. That's his psych deductible,not his medical.

17:46.790 --> 17:51.060
对不起 精神是指精神病类?
Sorry. Psych as in psychiatric?

17:56.580 --> 17:59.200
我允许你给菲利打电话了?
I give you permission to call Philly?

17:59.210 --> 18:01.680
伙计  我问你问题呢
Hey, I asked you a question, man.

18:01.690 --> 18:03.620
听着
Listen. There, uh...

18:03.630 --> 18:05.400
这儿的规矩得变变
there's been a restructuring.

18:05.410 --> 18:08.970
这是菲利自己说的
This comes from Philly himself.

18:08.980 --> 18:11.210
你用不着递话  菲波纳奇
You couldn't deliver Fibonacci,

18:11.220 --> 18:13.530
我现在是这儿的老大
so I'm the man in here now.

18:13.540 --> 18:14.900
听着  吉利
Listen.

18:14.910 --> 18:16.850
去商品给我买一袋薯条
Run to the commissary and get me a packet of chips.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.750
我就当什么事都没发生过
We'll pretend this never happened.

18:18.760 --> 18:19.700
好的  我告诉你  约翰
No, I'm telling you, John.

18:19.710 --> 18:24.750
你越早面对这些事实 我们相处地就会越好
The sooner you face these facts, the better off we will all be.

18:24.760 --> 18:28.640
我可以让你死于心脏病
I can kill you in a heartbeat.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.360
我对此表示怀疑
Somehow, I doubt that.

18:34.370 --> 18:40.350
你越早面对这些事实  我们相处地就会越好
The sooner you face facts,the better off we will all be.

18:41.970 --> 18:46.390
你已经过气了  约翰
You're yesterday's news, John.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.100
这是在干吗?  对付黑人?
What's the word? Y'all cooking brownies?

18:58.110 --> 19:00.600
-规矩点  -什么意思?
-Act your race, milk chicken. -What's the deal, yo?

19:00.610 --> 19:03.290
人多势众怎么着?
You got tough buckets or something?

19:03.300 --> 19:07.840
你在给白人丢脸  知道吗
You're a disgrace to your skin,you know that?

19:07.850 --> 19:10.420
那小子只是滑倒了
The boy just slipped.

19:10.430 --> 19:12.580
只是滑倒了
The boy just slipped.

19:12.590 --> 19:15.710
是不是?
Ain't that right?

19:16.640 --> 19:18.150
起来
Come on. Stand up.

19:18.150 --> 19:21.500
好了  都回到牢房里
Cons, let's get back to your cells.

19:21.510 --> 19:25.510
你叫什么名字
What's your name, boy?

19:34.960 --> 19:37.150
-是谁  -斯特内
-Who's that? -Stolte.

19:37.160 --> 19:40.060
斯特内  你知道我儿子的事了吧  是不是
Stolte. You've heard about my kid, right?

19:40.070 --> 19:41.900
把盘子拿去  林肯
Take the tray, Linc.

19:41.910 --> 19:44.610

你也有一个儿子
You have a son.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.120
叫乔伊

Don't do anything stupid, Linc.

20:05.410 --> 20:07.230

20:07.240 --> 20:12.290
我问一个问题就让你走
I just wanna ask you a question,then I'm gonna let go.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.990
要是是你儿子你怎么办?
What if it were Josh?

20:15.000 --> 20:19.280
如果碰到是你儿子呢？
What if it were your son?

20:20.710 --> 20:24.100

What they're saying about me, it's not true.

如果你们组织在寻求资金支持
Look,If your organisation's looking for a hand-out,

年轻人 请和我的商业部经理去交涉
Young man you can go through my business manager.

24:39.680 --> 24:43.980
夫人  我们不是为此事而来  事实上  可以坐下说吗?
Ma'am, that is not why we're here, actually.May we sit down?

24:43.990 --> 24:47.640
我们希望您能就众多案件的  一件提供些帮助
We hoped you could help us with one of our more public cases.

24:47.650 --> 24:48.910
是林肯·布伦斯一案

24:48.920 --> 24:51.970
如您所知  他因那些伪造的证据被起诉  事实上他是无辜的
As you know,He's making claims that he's innocent,

24:51.980 --> 24:53.670
是其他人蓄意谋杀了您丈夫

24:53.680 --> 24:55.760
我实在没有时间听你们长篇大论
I don't have time for a long conversation.

斯蒂德曼夫人  不会耽误您太久的
It doesn't have to be long conversation.

24:58.050 --> 25:00.450

If we talked about who had motive to kill Terrence,

25:00.460 --> 25:02.330
我们可以在这里呆上整天
we'd be here all day.

25:02.340 --> 25:04.120
-什么意思?  -看看周围
-I'm sorry? -Look around.

25:04.130 --> 25:07.670
这里有一半人是他公司的股东
Half the people here were shareholders in his company.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.250
每个人都在装着悼念他
Every one of them sat at my husband's memorial

25:10.260 --> 25:12.680
但每个人都有同样一个想法
and every one of them was thinking the same thing:

25:12.690 --> 25:14.640
"谢天谢地他终于死了"
"Thank God he's gone."

25:14.650 --> 25:17.460
-为什么会这样想?  -钱
-Why would they think that?  -Money.

25:17.470 --> 25:19.330
指控的流言一传开
As soon as rumours of the indictment started,

25:19.340 --> 25:21.890
他们就开始作鸟兽散
they ran for the exits.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.610
我没听过指控的事
I wasn't aware of any indictment.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.850

要不是我还不确定  是不是布伦斯开的枪
If I didn't know Burrows pulled that trigger,

25:35.170 --> 25:37.900
我可能会怀疑这个餐厅里的任何一个人
I'd say it was any one of these people in the restaurant.

25:37.900 --> 25:41.190

You're just caught in the middle, aren't you?

26:16.520 --> 26:20.190
标准的"左右不靠"
A regular 'tweener.

But, you know,the funny thing is we're also a lot alike.

26:29.640 --> 26:35.810
一对没人爱的可怜小狗
Couple of dogs with runny noses that nobody loves.

How's that knee, by the way?

26:40.110 --> 26:42.010
-你搞什么?  -不 不 不
-What the hell are you doing?  -No no no

26:42.020 --> 26:43.760
别误解我  我只是跟你做朋友
Don't get me wrong. I'm just a friend.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.650
对  "亲密"朋友  我可不要这个
A fruity friend. I don't need none of that.

26:45.660 --> 26:47.340

27:13.150 --> 27:15.180
你最好睁着眼睡觉  娘娘腔
You sleep with one eye open,girly.

27:15.190 --> 27:17.110
-放马过来  贱货  -我会的  我会的
-Bring it on.bitch  -Oh, I'm gonna

27:17.120 --> 27:20.570
-我会来的  -你最好别缠着那孩子
-I'll gonna bring it on in spades..  -You oughta leave that kid alone.

27:20.580 --> 27:25.800
你最好别多管闲事  嗯?
Maybe you are in no position to be telling me my business. Hm?

27:25.810 --> 27:29.360
就这么简单
That's what I thought.

27:32.310 --> 27:36.290
你肯定理解  我不能谈论以前的病人
I'm sure you can understand my reluctance to discuss past patients.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.360
当然
absolutely

27:37.370 --> 27:39.150
呃  不过我也知道根据HIPAA法案 (健康保险便携与核算法案)
My understanding is that under HIPAA

27:39.160 --> 27:44.700
只要病人被转移治疗  我们可以共享资料
we're allowed to share information as long as it furthers the care of the patient.

27:44.710 --> 27:49.710
我不太习惯这样质问别人 但是  我...
I'm not accustomed to making enquiries like this, but I...

27:49.720 --> 27:52.680
我感觉我可以治好他
I feel like I can get through to him.

27:52.690 --> 27:55.240
我可以帮他
I can help him.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.260
可以想像  他在那确实需要帮助
I imagine he needs it in there.

27:57.270 --> 27:59.890
你给他治疗什么病?
What did you treat him for?

27:59.900 --> 28:02.770
迈克尔有好几种病
Michael suffered from a couple of things.

28:02.780 --> 28:05.870
其中一种叫做"潜在抑制症"
One was a condition called low latent inhibition.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.960
不好意思  我不太懂术语
Sorry. I'm not familiar with the term.

28:08.970 --> 28:14.820
这种病人看到的东西跟我们不一样
People who suffer from low latent inhibition see everyday things like you or I do

28:14.830 --> 28:17.010
比如灯  做个例子
like this lamp.

28:17.020 --> 28:20.230
但我们眼中只能看到灯的形象
But where we just process the image of a lamp,

28:20.240 --> 28:21.920
他们能看到一切
they process everything.

28:21.930 --> 28:26.770
支架  灯泡  螺钉 甚至里面的垫圈
The stem, the bulb, the bolts,even the washers inside.

28:26.780 --> 28:32.590
他们的脑子对周围事物的信息更开放
Their brains are more open to incoming stimuli in the surrounding environment.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.360
其他人的脑子
Other people's brains

28:34.370 --> 28:37.630
像你和我 则把这些信息关在外面
yours and mine -shut out the same information.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.840
我们这么做是为了保持心智健全
We have to do it in order to keep our sanity.

28:40.850 --> 28:44.520
如果智商低的人患了"潜在抑制症"
If someone with a low IQ has low latent inhibition,

28:44.530 --> 28:47.980
结果通常是精神分裂
it almost always results in mental illness.

28:47.990 --> 28:51.290
但如果患者有足够高的智商
But if someone has a high IQ,

28:51.300 --> 28:55.770
结果通常是极具创造性的天才
it almost always results in creative genius.

28:57.130 --> 29:00.330
你认为迈克尔是天才吗?
Do you think Michael's a genius?

29:00.340 --> 29:04.610
这个词已经被当今媒体毁了
Well, I think that word's been derogated in the media these days.

29:04.620 --> 29:09.620
不过以这个词的本意来讲  没错  是的
But in the classic sense of the word, yes, I do.

29:09.630 --> 29:13.680
你说他还有其它疾病
You... you said there was something else you treated him for?

29:13.690 --> 29:17.070
他刚来的时候非常没有自信心
He came to me with absolutely no sense of self-worth.

29:17.080 --> 29:20.690
失去双亲的孩子通常都会这样
The loss of both parents very often does that to a child.

29:20.700 --> 29:23.660
但由于"潜在抑制症"
But with the low latent inhibition,

29:23.670 --> 29:26.470
迈克尔身上发生了一些有趣的事
something interesting happened to Michael.

29:26.480 --> 29:30.230
他变得对周围的苦难有强烈的共鸣
He became very attuned to all the suffering around him.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.700
他无法坐视不管
He couldn't shut it out.

29:32.710 --> 29:34.850
他成了帮助者
He became a rescuer,

29:34.860 --> 29:40.520
这种人关心其他人的幸福  远多过关心自己
one of those people who are more concerned with other people's welfare than their own.

29:40.530 --> 29:43.250
这些我一点都不了解
I didn't know all this about him.

29:43.260 --> 29:47.650
那说明你不了解迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Then maybe you don't know Michael Scofield.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.980
没错
Yeah.

31:06.880 --> 31:10.480
我的语音信箱有新消息
I checked my voicemail at work.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.300
林肯的儿子Lj刚给我留了言
Lincoln's son LJ just left me a message.

31:13.310 --> 31:16.240
他有麻烦了
He's in trouble.

31:27.680 --> 31:30.850
-谁?  -LJ  我是维罗妮卡  你在哪?
-Hello? -LJ, it's Veronica. Where are you?

31:30.860 --> 31:33.040
噢  维罗妮卡  我不知道
Oh, Veronica, I don't know.

31:33.050 --> 31:34.410
你必须来接我
You gotta come get me.

31:34.420 --> 31:37.500
我么不行知道吗? 我们不在芝加哥  你要过来找我们
We can't, OK? We're not in Chicago.You have to come to us.

31:37.510 --> 31:41.780
好吧  你们在哪?
Oh. All right. Where's that?

31:45.020 --> 31:47.960
-他们到底怎么知道我在哪的?  -怎么了?
-Oh. How the hell do they know where I am?  -What's going on?

31:47.970 --> 31:50.060
他们为什么总是知道我在哪的?
How do they know where I am?

31:50.070 --> 31:51.000
LJ...
LJ...

31:51.010 --> 31:53.410
-LJ 你听我说  -你不知道
-LJ, I want you to listen to me.  -No,you haven't get the mean...

31:53.420 --> 31:56.560
-我去任何地方  他们都能找到  -我要你听我说  好吗?
-Everywhere I go, they're there. -I want you to listen to me, OK?

31:56.570 --> 31:59.260
我需要你来找我们  我们在莫萨湖
I need you to come to us. We're in Lake Mercer.

31:59.270 --> 32:00.730
-那是什么地方?  -是一个小镇
-Where's that?  -On the lowa border.

32:00.740 --> 32:02.390
在爱荷华州边境  那有个车站
On the lowa border.There's a bus station.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.700
去买张车票  我们会在那儿接你
We'll meet you there.

32:04.710 --> 32:06.880
还好  他们还活着
They're still alive.

32:06.890 --> 32:10.600
看来可以一箭三雕了
The bird in the hand just became three.

32:10.610 --> 32:12.280
我们走
Let's go.

32:12.290 --> 32:15.450
-但是这孩子就在...  -我们走
-But the kid's right...  -Let's go.

32:19.190 --> 32:20.760
他们走了  他们走了
They're leaving. They're leaving.

32:20.770 --> 32:22.830
LJ我要你仔细听我说  好吗?
LJ, I need to know that you hear me, OK?

32:22.840 --> 32:24.520
莫萨湖
Lake Mercer.

32:24.530 --> 32:26.660
莫萨湖  知道了
Lake Mercer. OK.

32:26.670 --> 32:29.890

Thanks.

33:59.700 --> 34:02.330
我  呃...
I...

34:02.530 --> 34:07.600
只是想让你知道如果你想在这找人谈谈  我原意
just wanted you to know that if you're looking for someone to talk to, you're not alone.

34:07.610 --> 34:11.790
帮助犯人解决困难也是我工作的一部分
It's part of my job to counsel inmates and help them with their problems.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.880

I got things pretty well figured out.

34:15.890 --> 34:20.400
我了解了一些你的背景
I sort of backed into some information about you.

34:20.410 --> 34:22.310
我希望你不介意
I hope you don't mind,

34:22.320 --> 34:25.140
你要明白我成为医生的初衷  就是想帮助别人
but there's a reason I became a doctor.

34:25.140 --> 34:29.080
这是我的本能
It's in my nature to want to help.

34:29.090 --> 34:33.130
从我理解的角度 这也是你的天性
From what I understand,it's in your nature too.

34:39.650 --> 34:43.160

What happened?

The man you're talking about died the moment I stepped inside these walls.

其实是我要搞到最后一个小跟班了哈
The fact that I'm gonna get me one fine piece of tail certainly don't hurt either.

Nothing like tail, eh, Scofield?

39:43.190 --> 39:45.600

明白了?
Do we understand each other?

40:46.050 --> 40:48.230
