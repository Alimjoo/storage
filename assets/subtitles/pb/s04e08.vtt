00:00.830 --> 00:02.000
《越狱》  前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

00:03.060 --> 00:06.160
如果"锡拉"是一张饼  我们只拿到其中一块
If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got is a slice.

00:06.230 --> 00:07.930
"锡拉"不是一张卡
So Scylla isn't one card.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.430
是六张
It's six.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.800
这事发生多久了
How long has  it been happening?

00:11.860 --> 00:12.860
这不是大问题
It's not a big deal.

00:12.930 --> 00:13.960
你13岁的时候  就已是个大问题了
It was a big deal when you were 13.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.560
迈克尔和你说过妈的事吗
Michael told you about Mom?

00:15.630 --> 00:18.400
-没有  -她小时候经常流鼻血
No. As a kid, she got nosebleeds.

00:18.460 --> 00:20.630
她30多岁时  又开始流鼻血
In her 30s, they started up again.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.130
你母亲什么时候去世的
How old was your mom when she passed away?

00:22.200 --> 00:25.100
31岁  迈克尔也刚好31岁
31. Michael's just turning 31.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.700
那个人是谁
Who's that?

00:27.760 --> 00:28.860
他就是杀我儿子的凶手
That's the man that killed my son.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.230
他就象个数码黑洞
It's like a digital black hole.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.760
能接收10英尺内的所有电子数据
It swallows up any electronic data within ten feet.

00:46.530 --> 00:47.330
格兰先生
Mr. Glenn?

00:47.400 --> 00:48.800
我们有麻烦了
We got a problem.

00:48.860 --> 00:50.130
那是干什么用的
What's that do?

00:50.200 --> 00:51.540
是个电子游戏机的
It's a battery pack

00:51.540 --> 00:52.330
电池组
for a video game console.

00:54.030 --> 00:56.100
那你只能买个新的了
You'll need to buy a new one.

00:57.330 --> 00:59.230
锡拉  明天给我的话
Scylla. Get it to me by tomorrow

00:59.300 --> 01:01.300
你就能拿原来报酬的一半
and you will receive 50% of the fee.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.160
后天  四分之一
Two days, 25%.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.730
大后天
Three days,

01:05.800 --> 01:07.000
我让你脑袋开花
I shoot you through the brain.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.660
你是谁
Who is this?

01:12.730 --> 01:14.660
你好  迈克尔
Hello, Michael.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.460
你明白吧
You know what?

01:29.530 --> 01:31.300
如果格莱布再给我找这样的烂活
If Crab ever throws a psycho at us like this again,

01:31.360 --> 01:33.000
我就宰了他
I'm going to kill him.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.530
对  但是我们如果不干的话  格莱布会宰了我们
Yeah, but if we don't get this psycho, Crab's going to kill us.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.000
把枪准备好
Just have the burner ready.

01:37.060 --> 01:38.830
准备好了
Got it covered.

01:42.130 --> 01:44.430
做完这个之后  我就洗手不干了
After this job, I'm done, man.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.160
我不能再做下去了
I can't do this anymore.

01:46.230 --> 01:49.030
你觉得格莱布会怎么说
What do you think Crab will say about that?

01:49.100 --> 01:51.200
我不管他说什么
I don't care what Crab says about that.

01:51.260 --> 01:54.130
如果进监狱的话  我还怎么做个好父亲
How can I be a good father if I'm always in prison?

01:54.200 --> 01:57.700
我错过了我孩子的童年
I missed out on my kid's childhood.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.630
我不能再错过他成长的过程
I'm not going to miss out on him becoming a man.

01:59.700 --> 02:04.460
说实话  就算是你干  这个计划也太大胆了
You know, not for nothing, but this plan is crazy even for you.

02:04.530 --> 02:06.030
你确定这是唯一办法
You sure this is the only way?

02:06.100 --> 02:07.200
没错
Yeah.

02:08.530 --> 02:10.830
快看  他出来了
Hey look. He's coming out.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.830
他带着箱子
He's got the case.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.030
系好安全带
Let's buckle up.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.730
把手举起来  把手举起来
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!

02:59.160 --> 03:00.100
别客气
You're welcome.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.230
快闪
Let's go!

03:09.360 --> 03:11.260
等等  这就是你的好主意
So wait a minute. This is your brilliant plan?

03:11.330 --> 03:14.860
你打算用自杀的方法去撞将军的车
You're going to pull a kamikaze mission on the General's car?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.400
你的仪器已经没了
Now that the device is gone,

03:17.460 --> 03:19.200
你的意见也就不重要了
your opinion doesn't matter.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.800
闭嘴  加你的油
So shut up and pump.

03:22.060 --> 03:24.530
我们知道将军总是轻装行动
We know the General travels light.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.230
一辆轿车  几个保镖
One limo and a couple of guards.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.860
我不担心那几个保镖  我担心的是撞车
It ain't the guards I'm worried about; it's the crash.

03:27.930 --> 03:30.600
我没说过这会很轻松
Look, I never said this was going to be easy.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.900
别激动
Just relax.

03:49.860 --> 03:52.660
首先  巴拿马的事是公事公办
First off, Panama was a job.

03:52.730 --> 03:54.060
日后再算账
Some other time.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.300
你要“锡拉“做什么
What do you want with Scylla?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.400
那是我自己的事
That's my business.

03:56.460 --> 03:57.900
我们不是在巴拿马
We're not in Panama anymore,

03:57.960 --> 04:00.230
我也不在监狱里  我再问一次
and I'm not behind a fence, so, again,

04:00.300 --> 04:01.730
你要“锡拉”做什么
what do you want with Scylla?

04:01.800 --> 04:04.030
和你一样  打垮公司
Same thing you want: bring down the Company.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.530
很好  那你何不
Great. Then why don't you

04:05.600 --> 04:07.360
把缺的几页纸给我  然后消失呢
give me those missing pages and disappear?

04:07.430 --> 04:09.230
我很想那么做  你记得那天
I'd love to. You remember that day

04:09.300 --> 04:11.460
我们在罗斯福酒店  惠斯勒复制了Lief的卡
at the Roosevelt when Whistler made off with Lief's card?

04:11.530 --> 04:13.630
你觉得是谁的主意
Who do you think took the fall for that?

04:13.700 --> 04:16.160
我们的名字都在同一张黑名单里
Our names are at the top of the same hit list.

04:16.230 --> 04:18.330
我不知道你们有什么协议
Now, I don't know what arrangement you two have,

04:18.400 --> 04:19.800
我需要一些资金
but I need some traveling money.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.030
我们过会再谈这个
Let's talk about that later.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.330
我们干嘛不谈谈你是在给
Why don't we talk about the kind of scum

04:22.400 --> 04:23.900
什么样的烂人付钱
you're willing to put on the payroll?

04:23.960 --> 04:25.860
告诉我一个用不到她的理由  我听你的
Give me a way to do it without her, and we'll do it.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.330
我们需要那些纸
We need the pages.

04:28.860 --> 04:31.200
这是个交易
It's a package deal.

04:31.260 --> 04:33.030
我们是拍档了吗
Are we partners?

04:36.500 --> 04:38.030
拍档
Partners.

04:47.860 --> 04:50.230
我刚刚往机器里投了一个币
Look, I barely dropped a nickel in the slots, right?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.500
那人就过来了
This guy was all...

04:51.560 --> 04:52.630
我们真应该打死你
We ought to blanket party your ass.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.560
那个仪器呢
Where's the device?

04:54.630 --> 04:56.700
-能不能拿回来  -快说
Can it be salvaged? Tell him.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.400
赌台老板把它收走了
Pit boss walked off with it.

05:02.460 --> 05:06.030
那好  我们只能让你提前退休了
Okay. Well, we're going to call this your early retirement.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.560
你要么上楼
You can either go upstairs

05:07.630 --> 05:10.200
坐在你的小床上  等我们把事情解决
and sit on your cot and ride out the rest of this thing,

05:10.260 --> 05:11.560
否则  我就给赛尔夫探员打电话
or I can call Agent Self

05:11.630 --> 05:13.700
那你就能慢慢享受刑期了
and you can ride out the rest of your prison sentence.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.400
你选吧
Your choice.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.930
我要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.360
你哥哥说了你流鼻血的事
So your brother told me about your nosebleeds.

05:38.430 --> 05:40.880
他还说了你妈妈的情况
And he told me about your mom.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.530
那不是他该做的
That wasn't his place.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.430
为你担心
To be worried about you?

05:43.500 --> 05:47.030
妈妈得病时  林肯每天都在医院  握着她的手
When Mom got sick, Linc was at the hospital every day, holding her hand,

05:47.100 --> 05:49.760
看着妈妈去世  他那时才13岁
watching her die, and he was 13.

05:49.830 --> 05:52.030
这件事改变了他  让他对任何事都过头担心
It changed him. It made him overprotective.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.030
现在他开始
And now he's jumping

05:53.100 --> 05:54.130
用错误的原因
to all the wrong conclusions

05:54.200 --> 05:55.360
得出错误的结论
for all the wrong reasons,

05:55.430 --> 05:57.200
而且都无中生有的
and it's... it's over nothing because

05:57.260 --> 05:58.900
我很好
I'm fine.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.730
你看起来可不好
You don't look fine.

06:01.800 --> 06:07.710
因为我也有些事情要告诉你
Well, maybe that's because there's something I have to tell you.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.700
格雷琴还活着
Gretchen's alive.

《越狱》第四季 第八集
Prison.Break.S04E08

06:55.600 --> 06:58.330
她和帝博格一起合作
She's working with T-Bag,

06:58.400 --> 07:00.800
他们有几张惠斯勒的鸟类书页
and they have several pages from Whistler's bird book,

07:00.860 --> 07:02.830
他们也想加入找锡拉
and they want in on Scylla.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.830
我们说话的同时  赛尔夫正和他们谈条件
Self is cutting them a deal as we speak.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.060
赛尔夫知道他们有自己的计划
Self knows that they have their own agenda,

07:11.130 --> 07:12.500
但我们也有
but so do we

07:12.560 --> 07:14.400
只要我们拿到那几页纸
and as soon as we get those pages back,

07:14.460 --> 07:16.600
格雷琴和帝博格就会为他们做的事付出代价
Gretchen and T-Bag are going to pay for everything.

07:16.660 --> 07:18.730
他们会得到应有的惩罚
They're going to get exactly what's coming to them.

07:25.860 --> 07:28.060
整件事情和格雷琴无关
This isn't about Gretchen.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.830
也不会牵扯私人恩怨
It's not about any one person.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.230
我们必须结束这一切
And we... we have to finish it.

07:37.530 --> 07:39.130
我想自己呆一会
I need a minute.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.230
可以吗
Please.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.460
我绝对不相信
I can't believe this!

08:23.530 --> 08:24.830
我们有其他选择吗
What choice do we have?

08:24.900 --> 08:26.260
格雷琴加入我们
Gretchen's on the team.

08:26.330 --> 08:27.460
不管喜不喜欢
Like it or not,

08:27.530 --> 08:29.100
我们需要那几页纸
we need those pages.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.000
我们要和这婊子[西班牙语]合作
Another perra we're jumping in bed with?

08:30.060 --> 08:31.460
对我们来说不是第一次了
Not exactly new territory for us.

08:31.530 --> 08:33.100
我不管我们要和谁合作
I don't care who we gotta partner up with.

08:33.160 --> 08:35.360
我们拿到那些纸  就才可以打入"公司"
We get those papers, we make with the break-in,

08:35.430 --> 08:36.830
就能完成任务
we get this job done.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.860
她也可能和"公司"还有联系  我不确定
She could still have ties to the Company, man. I don't know.

08:38.930 --> 08:41.600
到时候  我们再担心格雷琴
We'll worry about Gretchen when the time is right.

08:41.660 --> 08:44.400
现在  我们要集中在将军身上
For now, let's focus on the General.

08:46.630 --> 08:49.030
格雷琴加入我们也改变不了什么
This thing with Gretchen doesn't change a thing.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.800
我们
We're, uh...

08:50.860 --> 08:52.530
我们还是接近目标
we're still close.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.460
更接近"锡拉"  离怀特却更远了
Closer to Scylla, farther from Wyatt.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.930
这也说不准
You don't know that.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.300
先集中精力  好吗
Just stay focused, all right?

08:59.360 --> 09:01.260
这才是我要集中精力的地方
This is my focus, okay?

09:01.330 --> 09:04.460
我还是做我该做的事
I'm doing the job, okay? All right? All right?

09:04.530 --> 09:07.500
每一天  杀我儿子的凶手就离我更远
Every day, the trail to my son's killer gets a little bit colder.

09:08.730 --> 09:11.030
我能做的就只有集中精力
That's all I do is focus.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.030
你在干什么
What are you doing?

09:27.100 --> 09:29.230
只是
Um... It's just... uh...

09:29.300 --> 09:30.530
我们要把电脑拿楼下用
We're going to need that downstairs.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.400
那我就呆在这好了
Yeah. I'll just, uh... be up here.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.600
多少钱换斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
How much for Scofield and Burrows?

10:40.920 --> 10:43.920
我听说你们俩有了个协议
I see you two have come to an agreement.

10:43.980 --> 10:45.150
放了她 是因为她要工作
She's on work release,

10:45.220 --> 10:46.580
和你一样
just like you.

10:46.650 --> 10:48.150
什么样的工作
What kind of work?

10:48.220 --> 10:50.820
你和那个秘书在办公室里保守秘密
You and the secretary keep things quiet in the office

10:50.880 --> 10:52.420
迈克尔从隧道去找"锡拉"
while Michael tunnels to Scylla.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.480
你真的以为
You really think

10:55.550 --> 10:57.650
斯科菲尔德会遵守他的诺言
Scofield's gonna keep his word, huh?

10:59.020 --> 11:01.650
你把他爱的女人往死里打
You horsewhipped the woman he loves.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.820
迈克尔和我们一样想得到“锡拉”
Michael wants Scylla just as badly as we do.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.550
没错  他当时也想逃出监狱
Yeah, he wanted out of prison, too.

11:05.620 --> 11:09.180
我们的合作在那之后就结束了
Our partnership lasted long enough for that to happen,

11:09.250 --> 11:10.980
然后  我们就分道扬镳了
and then...  we parted ways.

11:11.050 --> 11:11.880
相信我
Trust me.

11:11.950 --> 11:13.980
先生  请进
Yeah, um, go on in, sir.

11:14.050 --> 11:16.350
斯科菲尔德会利用你
Scofield will use you

11:16.420 --> 11:19.220
为了给他女朋友报仇  他会在你背后来一刀
and then he's gonna bury the knife in your back for what you did to his lady friend.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.820
"锡拉"在哪
Where's Scylla?

11:25.880 --> 11:29.350
早上好  先生
Good morning to you, too, sir.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.350
先生们
Gentlemen.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.150
我给了你3天
I gave you three days.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.680
"锡拉"在哪
Where's Scylla?

11:36.450 --> 11:38.580
我
I...

11:38.650 --> 11:44.320
冯先生  别急着下结论
Now, uh, Mr. Feng, let's not do anything rash.

11:44.380 --> 11:46.220
你就是冯
So you're Feng.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.320
我们还没见过面
We haven't actually met in person.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.420
我就是"斑蛇行动"中
I was the liaison between the Company and your

11:51.480 --> 11:53.720
你的雇主和"公司"之间的联络人
Chinese employers on Operation Copperhead.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.320
苏珊
Susan?

11:56.380 --> 11:57.350
没错
That's right.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.180
你从为"公司"卖命
You went from working for the Company

12:00.250 --> 12:02.250
转变为盗取能摧毁他们的证据
to stealing the one thing that could destroy them.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.080
这个转变未免太突然了
That's a tight turn.

12:04.150 --> 12:06.150
从"锡拉"的价格来看
With a price that Scylla commands on the open market,

12:06.220 --> 12:07.150
任何人都会变
anybody would turn.

12:07.220 --> 12:09.280
顺便说一下  值200吧
Which is, by the way, 200.

12:13.450 --> 12:16.080
我们在行动中没有合作过
Our paths never crossed on Copperhead,

12:16.150 --> 12:19.350
但是我确实和你的一个同事合作过
but I did deal with one of your colleagues;

12:19.420 --> 12:21.050
一个不太能干的中间人
a less-capable associate.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.120
他怎么了
Whatever happened to him?

12:24.180 --> 12:26.250
他已经从这个世界消失了
He was skinned and hung from an overpass.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.850
我想起来了
Oh, yes, I recall.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.420
他没有在保证的时间内把东西送到
He couldn't deliver on promises made.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.080
你也可能会想起  他是我的前任
You may also recall that he was my predecessor.

12:34.150 --> 12:36.180
我参加行动后  你得到了你想要的
When I joined Copperhead, you got what you wanted.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.520
我也会得到"锡拉"
You'll get Scylla, too.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.350
如果我拿不到
If I don't,

12:40.420 --> 12:43.780
我就扒了你的皮
I'll peel you like a wet grape.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.220
报酬是100
And the price is 100.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.580
150
150.

12:47.650 --> 12:51.820
125  别让我失望
125. Don't disappoint me.

12:58.220 --> 13:03.380
你们说的  125
Well, 125...

13:03.450 --> 13:04.150
再乘1百万
Million.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.920
苏珊  格雷琴  不管你名字是什么
Susan, Gretchen, whatever your name is,

13:08.980 --> 13:11.320
我建议你赶快找个方法
I suggest you find a way to bury the hatchet

13:11.380 --> 13:13.820
和迈克尔·斯科菲尔德的女人和解
with Michael Scofield's woman.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.980
我们有的忙了
We got work to do.

13:25.220 --> 13:29.120
我怎么觉得有人早上起来
Why do I get the feeling that some poor bastard woke up

13:29.180 --> 13:30.450
会发现自己的车没了
to an empty driveway this morning?

13:30.520 --> 13:32.450
放松  我们从回收厂找来的
Relax, we got it from a scrap yard.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.250
你们准备就寄望于
And you're pinning the hopes

13:34.320 --> 13:35.980
这堆废铁吗
of the entire mission on that relic?

13:36.050 --> 13:37.520
如果是第一张卡  我不会这么做
If it was card one, I'd say no.

13:37.580 --> 13:38.680
如果是第五张
If this was card five,

13:38.750 --> 13:40.980
我也不会这么做  但这是最后一张
I'd say no, but it's the last card.

13:41.050 --> 13:42.620
我觉得可以假装肇事逃逸
I really think we can stage a hit-and-run

13:42.680 --> 13:43.850
没有人会关注这件事
and get away with it.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.080
好吧  我们知道他在哪上班
All right, we know where this guy works.

13:49.150 --> 13:50.920
我们也知道他的路线
We know his route.

13:50.980 --> 13:53.350
我会在这个十字路口等他
I'm gonna wait for him at this intersection.

13:53.420 --> 13:55.180
他开过来
He drives through.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.780
我开车撞他  拿到卡
I smash him with my car, get the card.

13:57.850 --> 14:00.320
如果你能奇迹般活着离开现场
And if by some miracle you walked away from the crash,

14:00.380 --> 14:01.950
将军就会知道是你偷了卡
the General's gonna know that you ripped him off.

14:02.020 --> 14:03.880
除非我先给他打一针吗啡
Not if I pump him full of morphine first.

14:03.950 --> 14:05.880
将军会第二天在医院醒过来
The General's gonna wake up tomorrow morning in the hospital

14:05.950 --> 14:08.150
一点也不记得到底发生了什么事情
feeling happy as a clam with no idea what happened to him.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.620
当他不省人事的时候
When he's out cold,

14:09.680 --> 14:11.120
我们把卡下载到手提电脑里
we download the card onto the laptop

14:11.180 --> 14:12.550
再把原卡放回去
and put the original back on him.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.420
你以为救护人员来了
And you don't think this is gonna look suspicious

14:14.480 --> 14:16.280
不会怀疑吗
for the paramedics that show up at the scene?

14:16.350 --> 14:18.480
那就要看急救人员是谁了
That depends on who the paramedics are.

14:18.550 --> 14:20.150
现在有四辆救护车
At the federal impound lot downtown,

14:20.220 --> 14:21.850
因走私药品
there are currently four ambulances seized

14:21.920 --> 14:23.050
被扣押在市中心的车管所
in a drug-smuggling ring.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.180
我们只需要一辆
All we need is one.

14:25.250 --> 14:26.880
你去搞定吧
Go make yourself useful.

14:31.420 --> 14:32.960
指挥官会在作战前集结军队
Time was commanders would assemble their troops

14:33.020 --> 14:38.390
并在方形土阵中做排练
before a battle and rehearse schemes of maneuver

14:38.460 --> 14:42.260
用石头代指敌方地点
on a square of dirt using rocks to depict enemy positions.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.890
他们称之为  "划石作战"
They called these rehearsals "rock drills."

14:45.960 --> 14:50.420
老挝就是我们的石头  现在...
Laos was our rock drill. Now...

14:51.860 --> 14:54.990
现在已经箭在弦上了
it's time for the battle to commence.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.060
格里芬
Griffin.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.120
用伪钞冲刷老挝市场
Flooding the Laotian market with counterfeit kip

15:00.190 --> 15:02.020
非常有效
was highly effective.

15:02.090 --> 15:05.160
到第二阶段  影响将继续扩大
In Phase Two, the effect will take longer,

15:05.220 --> 15:08.490
但结果必然如出一辙
but the result will inevitably be the same.

15:08.560 --> 15:11.890
我正在停止该命令
I'm signing off on the order to open up

15:11.960 --> 15:14.460
以打开下一战区
the next theater of operations.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.790
失陪
Excuse me.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.990
信息来源很难摸透
The message is untraceable.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.590
某人花了很多功夫
Someone went to a lot of trouble

15:30.660 --> 15:32.120
去掩盖他们的踪迹
to cover their tracks.

15:32.190 --> 15:36.360
你怎么知道此人能帮我们找到这两兄弟
How do we know this person can deliver the brothers?

15:36.420 --> 15:37.990
我们不知道
We don't.

15:38.060 --> 15:40.790
引蛇出洞
Bait the hook.

15:40.860 --> 15:42.760
看他会不会上钩
See if he bites.

15:53.390 --> 15:56.160
你好  朋友
Hey-hey, my friend!

This is a federal impound lot, correct?

16:13.460 --> 16:15.290

16:15.360 --> 16:18.060
我的意图很明显  菲尔  我需要一辆车

16:48.120 --> 16:49.020
你为什么

16:49.090 --> 16:50.490
哪壶不开提哪壶
starting fires that I have to put out?

16:50.560 --> 16:52.560
妈妈都没能逃脱病魔  你以为你...
Mom couldn't outrun this. What makes you think you...?

16:52.620 --> 16:54.860
这和妈妈的情况不一样  那是20年前的事
It's not Mom, all right? That was 20 years ago.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.260
这不一样  完全不一样
This is different. It's totally different.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.820
上车
Get in.

17:09.490 --> 17:11.760
我的头头来视察菜鸟们的宿舍
So my section chief comes over to the rookie's stretcher

17:11.820 --> 17:14.460
然后他说  你们的补贴还真不少啊  孩子
and he goes, "You got one hell of a workman's comp claim, kid."

17:17.290 --> 17:19.690
兄弟 我们说正事吧
Hey, uh, let's get that trip ticket started.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.920

菲尔  我得走了
You know what, Phil? I gotta go.

17:25.820 --> 17:26.920

17:26.990 --> 17:28.220
我刚想起来

17:31.420 --> 17:32.590

既然你们都不用戴脚踝监视器
So, if neither one of you are wearing ankle monitors,

18:03.160 --> 18:04.490

19:19.960 --> 19:21.060
你担心什么

看来我成了惠斯勒先生
Being as I was the original recipient

21:32.390 --> 21:35.290
艺术品的接收者
of the late Mr. Whistler's artwork...

21:35.350 --> 21:37.950

21:53.190 --> 21:56.650
的六座墓碑就是明证

21:56.720 --> 21:59.450
墓碑上的名字
The names on those grave markers

21:59.520 --> 22:03.650

人人都认为锡拉

22:31.220 --> 22:33.590

22:38.650 --> 22:41.620

长了个错构瘤
in her right frontal lobe.

23:48.290 --> 23:49.450
是的

23:51.050 --> 23:53.220
那种肿瘤增大后会造成困扰
When a tumor like that gets large enough to be problematic,

23:53.290 --> 23:55.720
还会伴随很多症状

-告诉我  -好的  但我没有
you'd let me know. Yes, but I haven't.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.650
我也不会
And I won't.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.920
我没事
And I'm fine.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.590
2IBA333
2IBA333

24:19.820 --> 24:22.450
迈克
Michael.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.320
将军要走了
The General is leaving.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.950
将军要走了
The General is leaving.

24:29.020 --> 24:30.450
好的  大家就绪
All right, everybody get ready.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.490
你没事吧
You doing all right?

24:42.550 --> 24:45.090
没事  只是不习惯到处是血
Fine. Just not so good around blood is all.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.920
我来处理好了
I'll take care of the messy part,

24:46.990 --> 24:49.990
你只要帮我把他弄上轮床
you just help me get him on the gurney.

24:59.350 --> 25:01.850
不用两个人去撞一辆车
Doesn't take two people to crash a car, you know.

25:04.490 --> 25:05.550
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding me, right?

25:05.620 --> 25:07.550
我们可曾共患难
After all I've been through with you?

25:07.620 --> 25:08.990
现在你倒担心我了
Now you're worried about my ass?

25:11.550 --> 25:13.320
闭嘴  开车
Shut up and drive, okay?

25:13.390 --> 25:14.690
系好安全带
Buckle up.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.050
什么事
What is it?

25:26.120 --> 25:28.290
林肯  我们看到他了  离你们两条街远
Linc, we got him. He's two blocks away from you.

25:28.350 --> 25:29.320
我们准备好了
We're on it.

25:30.290 --> 25:32.490
开始了
Here we go.

25:44.420 --> 25:46.190
他在做什么
What's he doing?

25:46.250 --> 25:47.190
不对劲
Something's wrong.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.720
他掉头了
He's turning around.

25:48.790 --> 25:50.690
林肯  撤退  是陷阱
Linc, pull back! It's a trap.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.850
我们快闪
Let's get out of here.

25:58.790 --> 26:01.250
苏克雷  趴下
Sucre, get down!

26:01.320 --> 26:02.590
林肯  快点
Come on, Linc!

26:03.290 --> 26:04.220
开快点
Faster!

26:04.290 --> 26:05.250
低下头
Keep your head down!

26:05.320 --> 26:06.390
抓紧
Hang on!

26:07.720 --> 26:09.450
你没事吧
You all right?!

26:34.650 --> 26:37.220
费尔南多  坚持住  你会没事的
Stay with us, Fernando. You're going to be all right.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.490
他直接冲过来  我们中埋伏了
He came straight at us. We were set up.

26:39.550 --> 26:41.390
你是说他们知道我们会去那
So you're saying that they knew we were going to be there?

26:41.450 --> 26:43.920
-那他们也知道这地方了  -我也这么说
Then they know about this place. That's exactly what I'm saying.

26:43.990 --> 26:46.620
-布拉德  我要纱布  -随时会有人过来的
Brad, I'm gonna need some gauze. Somebody could be coming here right now.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.290
如果他们知道这地方  那我们早就死了
If they knew about this place, we'd already be dead.

26:48.350 --> 26:49.950
那个格雷琴呢
What about that Gretchen chick?

26:50.020 --> 26:51.890
她有惠斯勒的几张书页
She's got a couple of pages from Whistler's bird book.

26:51.950 --> 26:53.890
她不可能知道
It doesn't make her psychic.

26:53.950 --> 26:55.990
布拉德  我需要纱布
Brad, I need some gauze.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.770
现在相信我了吧
Trust me now?

27:25.150 --> 27:27.690
看来有人出卖我们了
Well, it looks like someone set us up.

27:27.750 --> 27:29.290
-真的吗  -是的
Seriously? Yeah.

27:29.350 --> 27:31.520
我在想是不是你
And I'm wondering if it was you.

27:34.150 --> 27:36.090
你们起初是排斥我
Okay, first you give me the leper treatment,

27:36.150 --> 27:37.120
现在又说我是告密者
and now I'm a traitor

27:37.190 --> 27:38.920
-是吗  -的了吧  罗兰
is that right? Come on, Roland, who else

27:38.990 --> 27:40.220
除了你还有谁知道我们
could've known we were going

27:40.290 --> 27:41.620
-要去那个交叉口  -告诉你
at that intersection? You know what, just because

27:41.690 --> 27:43.290
别因为我没跟你们一起行动  就说我是告密者
I didn't do time with you guys, it doesn't make me a rat.

27:43.350 --> 27:45.250
对此我的投入
All right? I put just as much into this job

27:45.320 --> 27:46.290
不比任何人少
as anybody else.

27:46.350 --> 27:47.490
就算我犯了个小错
Okay, I make one little mistake

27:47.550 --> 27:48.650
我就成犹大了吗
and all of a sudden I'm Judas?

27:48.720 --> 27:50.220
不  算了
No, you know what? You know, no.

27:50.290 --> 27:52.820
打电话给Self  我回
Call Self, okay, because... because I'm gonna go back

27:52.890 --> 27:53.990
-监狱去  -好了
to the can. I'm done with this... All right.

27:54.050 --> 27:56.550
冷静点  冷静点
Just calm down. Calm down.

27:56.620 --> 27:58.220
我要你查一下
I want you to look up

27:58.290 --> 28:00.020
帝王大道和威洛斯大道街角的
all the local businesses at the corner

28:00.090 --> 28:01.520
所有地方企业
of King and Willow.

28:01.590 --> 28:03.320
我要外部装有安全摄像的
I need the ones with exterior security cameras,

28:03.390 --> 28:04.850
因为我要查个车牌号
'cause I'm looking for a license plate number,

28:04.920 --> 28:06.590
好吗
all right?

28:09.550 --> 28:11.720
为什么不道歉
How about an apology?

28:19.590 --> 28:20.920
斯科菲尔德去哪了
Where the hell is Scofield?

28:20.990 --> 28:22.650
我们全等着他破土动工
We've been waiting for him to break ground all day.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.590
他还要处理最后一件事
He's taking care of one last thing.

28:24.650 --> 28:25.820
早上他会来找你
He'll be here in the morning.

28:25.890 --> 28:27.820
莎拉呢  她对会面作何回应
And Sara, what'd she say about our meeting?

28:27.890 --> 28:29.890
她说没兴趣
She's not interested.

28:29.950 --> 28:31.550
行  如果她改变注意  我会在那等她
Okay, well, if she changes her mind, I'll be there.

28:31.620 --> 28:33.090
只想让大家都知道
Just so everyone knows,

28:33.150 --> 28:35.650
这是莎拉做了结的最后机会
this is Sara's last chance to settle up.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.150
我想让大家开诚布公
I want all the grievances out on the table

28:37.220 --> 28:38.190
这样我们才能继续合作
so we can move forward.

28:39.620 --> 28:42.190
听清楚了  美女
Listen to me, skank.

28:42.250 --> 28:43.250
你只是被
You just got your stripes

28:43.320 --> 28:44.920
你的旧老板甩掉的鸟人
ripped off your sleeve by your old boss.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.220
不管以前你在公司里的官多大
So whatever clout you had with the Company,

28:47.290 --> 28:48.220
现在都没了
it's gone.

28:48.290 --> 28:49.920
你现在是我的手下
You work for me now.

28:49.990 --> 28:53.520
所以  你在这个乡巴佬面前怎么摆架子都行
So you can try to pull rank on the hick here all you want,

28:53.590 --> 28:55.250
但别把我的耐心当弱点
but don't mistake my patience for weakness.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.620
你还活着只有一个理由
You're alive right now for one reason:

28:57.690 --> 28:59.420
就是我允许你活着
because I'm allowing you to be.

28:59.490 --> 29:00.850
一旦把锡拉弄到手
So when I get Scylla,

29:00.920 --> 29:02.420
你就可以拿到你的报酬
you'll get your traveling money.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.420
而这一切都结束后
And when this is over,

29:03.490 --> 29:05.250
你要是胆敢踏进
if you step one foot

29:05.320 --> 29:07.450
美国半步  我会用
on American soil, I'm gonna take

29:07.520 --> 29:09.790
这把枪...
this gun...

29:09.850 --> 29:12.050
用子弹在你这里
and I'm gonna put a bullet

29:12.120 --> 29:13.720
开个洞
right there.

29:17.450 --> 29:19.750
你也一样  乡巴佬
And that goes for you, too, Gummo.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.020
听清楚了吗
Are we clear?

29:21.090 --> 29:22.220
听清楚了
We're clear.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.750
给  我做的
Here. I made this.

29:32.820 --> 29:34.650
这个图表记录了
It's a chart of all

29:34.720 --> 29:36.050
所以进出这个办公室的人
the people coming in and out of the office,

29:36.120 --> 29:38.890
显示了哪天  什么时段是最忙的
showing which times of the day are the busiest

29:38.950 --> 29:41.320
以及什么时段可以挖掘
and which are best for digging.

29:42.850 --> 29:44.290
只管听电话就行
Just answer the phones.

29:49.890 --> 29:51.090
我会处理这个
I'll handle this.

29:56.790 --> 29:58.220
-拿到了吗  -等等
- Did you get it? - Hold on.

29:58.290 --> 29:59.850
赶快
Hurry up.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.090
为什么要
Why are we doing

30:03.150 --> 30:04.120
再做一次
this again?

30:04.190 --> 30:06.220
如果她想不付锡拉的账
It's an insurance policy.

30:06.290 --> 30:08.620
这就是我们的救命稻草
If she tries to get out of that big Scylla payday.

30:08.690 --> 30:10.520
有多少钱
How big of a payday?

30:10.590 --> 30:14.020
1百万美元
One million dollars.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.920
你如果再用枪指着我
You put a gun on me again,

30:19.990 --> 30:22.050
我就不会单单会把她的指纹复制下来
and these aren't the only set of prints I'll be copying.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.690
从现在开始  我们是盟友了
From this moment on, we are allies.

30:24.750 --> 30:25.820
她还在看我们吗
She watching?

30:25.890 --> 30:27.420
是的
Yes.

30:27.490 --> 30:28.990
撑着点
Brace yourself.

30:29.050 --> 30:29.990
干嘛
For what?

30:30.050 --> 30:34.190
没叫你  以后不准再踏进我办公室半步
Don't you ever come in my office again unless you're summoned!

30:41.750 --> 30:43.320
布伦斯在车上
Burrows was in the car.

30:43.390 --> 30:46.450
看来情报是可靠的
It appears our source is dependable.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.420
我说引蛇出洞  可不意味着用我做饵
When I said bait the hook, I did not mean with me.

30:49.490 --> 30:51.090
他们差一点就杀了我
They came that close to killing me.

30:51.150 --> 30:52.790
我不会让这种事情发生
I wouldn't let that happen.

30:54.250 --> 30:57.120
如果你不满意我的方法
But if you're unhappy with my methods,

30:57.190 --> 30:59.850
你大可以让别人来做
maybe you should parcel out the job to someone else.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.020
我不接受辞呈
I don't accept resignations.

31:02.090 --> 31:03.790
和神秘人达成协议
Close the deal with the mystery man

31:03.850 --> 31:05.220
今天就把俩兄弟给我抓回来
and bring the brothers to me today

31:05.290 --> 31:07.620
否则你的解雇金就会变成运尸袋
or your severence pay will be a body bag.

31:07.690 --> 31:11.350
光天化日  在大街上  他们知道你的路线
Broad daylight, city street, and they knew your route.

31:11.420 --> 31:14.920
如果斯科菲尔德的任务是想杀你
If Scofield's mission was to kill you,

31:14.990 --> 31:17.490
他会用更好的办法
he'd have a better way to do it.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.350
-还要其他东西吗  -不用
Sara, you have everything you need? No.

31:26.420 --> 31:27.550
没事
I'm good.

31:28.420 --> 31:31.160
一切顺利  好了
Everything's just fine.Alright.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.550
快好了  费尔南多
Almost done, Fernando.

31:36.640 --> 31:37.960
可以了
Now you go.

31:39.950 --> 31:42.420
医生  如果不是你的话 我就死在这桌子上了
I would've died on this table if it weren't for you, Doc.

31:42.490 --> 31:44.220
我会等你付诊金的
Mm-hmm. Just wait till you get my bill.

31:44.290 --> 31:45.720
撑着点  苏克雷
Hang in there, Sucre.

31:45.790 --> 31:48.220
就算"公司"还不知道这个仓库
Even if the warehouse ain't on the Company's radar,

31:48.290 --> 31:49.350
我们很清楚被发现后的结果
we sure as hell are.

31:49.420 --> 31:52.390
-这事完了  -你说不准
This job's over. You don't know that.

31:52.450 --> 31:54.050
我只知道  我不想回福克斯河监狱
I ain't going back to Fox River, I know that.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.520
你觉得赛尔夫发现公司把我们弄成这样
What do you think Self is gonna do

31:55.590 --> 31:57.390
他会怎么做
when he finds out the Company made us?

31:58.790 --> 32:00.150
我们很快就会知道
We're about to find out.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.490
喂
Yeah?

32:01.550 --> 32:03.050
罗兰在哪
Hey, where the hell is Roland?

32:03.120 --> 32:05.090
他的全球定位掉线了
His GPS just went offline.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.500
我到了
I'm here.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.420
怎样
Well?

32:45.490 --> 32:47.190
开丰田走了
Took the Corolla.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.690
-把他的手提也带了吗  -是的
Take his laptop, too? Yeah.

32:51.750 --> 32:53.150
阿历克斯
Alex.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.120
你还好吗
You doing okay?

33:04.190 --> 33:06.050
-医生  还要多久  -快了
How much longer,doc? Almost.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.220
你能处理这些吗
Hey, you got this covered?

33:09.290 --> 33:11.620
你们还在这干什么
What are you still doing here?

33:11.690 --> 33:13.490
去把那兔崽子抓回来
Go get the son of a bitch.

33:17.550 --> 33:19.020
行了
All done.

34:20.090 --> 34:21.720
把钱带来了吗
You got my money?

34:23.420 --> 34:26.590
我以为这是
Oh, yo, I thought this

34:26.650 --> 34:28.420
公平交易  对吧
was going to be a legit business transaction, okay?

34:28.490 --> 34:29.750
你不给我钱  我就不会
You don't got my money, I don't got

34:29.820 --> 34:33.290
-把俩兄弟的地址告诉你  -他们在哪
the location of the brothers. Where are they?

34:34.020 --> 34:35.250
天啊
Oh, God!

34:35.320 --> 34:37.890
你这是干什么
What are you doing?!

35:20.720 --> 35:22.020
莎拉
Sara...

35:29.820 --> 35:32.490
你好  莎拉
Hello, Sara.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.390
我以前的一个导师给我讲过一个故事
A former mentor of mine once told me a story

35:43.450 --> 35:45.450
我觉得很适合这个情况
that I think applies to this situation.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.030
内战结束时  格兰特的联军
At the end of the Civil War, Grant's Union Army

35:47.030 --> 35:51.450
在阿波马托克斯战胜李的联军
had Lee's Confederate soldiers outflanked at Appomattox.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.150
李明白更多流血事件的无益
Lee understood the futility of more bloodshed,

35:54.220 --> 35:56.090
所以他请求停战
so he requested a cease-fire.

35:56.150 --> 35:58.020
他想结束战争
He wanted to bring an end to the fighting.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.350
当天早上还在互相厮杀的士兵
Soldiers that had been killing each other that morning,

36:00.420 --> 36:02.250
下午首次穿过战线
walked across the lines that afternoon

36:02.320 --> 36:03.650
成为同盟
for the first time as allies

36:03.720 --> 36:06.320
互相交换北方的咖啡和南方的烟草
to trade Northern coffee for Southern tobacco.

36:06.390 --> 36:09.520
现在  我不期望我们互换礼品
Now, I don't expect us to exchange gifts,

36:09.590 --> 36:11.890
但不意味着我们不能成为盟友
but that doesn't mean we can't be allies.

36:20.790 --> 36:22.220
当然  你不会和解
Of course, you can't have a cease-fire

36:22.290 --> 36:23.320
除非双方
without both parties

36:23.390 --> 36:25.390
达到各自目的
getting what they want.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.590
你有5分钟
You have five minutes.

36:40.650 --> 36:43.720
随你尽管在我背上加伤疤
Put as many scars on my back as possible.

37:07.290 --> 37:10.450
我不想催你  但只剩4分钟了
I don't want to rush you, but you have four minutes left.

37:11.650 --> 37:13.050
她叫什么名字
What was her name?

37:13.120 --> 37:14.620
只有这一次机会  莎拉
This is a one-time deal, Sara.

37:14.690 --> 37:16.850
你要血债血还  现在就动手
You want your pound of flesh, you take it now.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.320
