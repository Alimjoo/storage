00:06.400 --> 00:08.650
有人会得到那笔钱 最好是我
Somebody's gonna get that money-- might as well be me.

00:08.660 --> 00:09.950
你知道 像那种工作
You know,a job like that

00:09.960 --> 00:14.090

00:14.100 --> 00:16.220
派些潜水员到河里去
I want divers down in the river.

很显然菲波纳奇会再次出庭
Apparently,Fibonacci's coming up for air again,

00:22.830 --> 00:25.490
如果他在那个听证会上作证
and if he testifies at that hearing,

00:25.500 --> 00:27.150
很多人都会被拖下水
a lot of people are going down.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.020
卡罗琳 他们把她带走了
Caroline. They're taking her in.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.520

Of course,I'll keep an eye on her.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.420

It's okay for you to leave now.

00:40.830 --> 00:43.100

是他们中的哪个?
<i>So which one of them was it?</i>

00:56.730 --> 00:58.090
可能是斯科菲尔德
Maybe Scofield.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.120
很可能还能找到他的哥哥
Probably gonna find his brother in there,too.

01:00.130 --> 01:03.190
你还会见她吗 那个医生
Are you meeting up with her,the doctor?

01:03.200 --> 01:04.300
我也不清楚
I don't know.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.630
我就知道这小婊子会带我们找到他们
I knew the little whore would take us right to 'em.

到了墨西哥 你们打算干什么?
<i>What happens when you get to Mexico?</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:15.190
你们打算去哪?
<i>Where will you go?</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:17.650
你不知道为好
It's best if you don't know.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.220
所有人都不知道最好
It's best for everyone.

01:19.230 --> 01:21.620
下个镇子你就下车
We'll drop you off in the next town,

01:21.630 --> 01:25.350
我说过会给你寄一万美金的

01:25.360 --> 01:28.960
不会超过两个星期
Shouldn't take more than a week or two.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.550
抓紧

02:09.560 --> 02:11.520
抓紧 抓紧了...
Hold on,hold on,hold on.

02:11.530 --> 02:13.900
抓紧
Hold on.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.540
这东西就不能开快一点吗
Can this thing go any faster?!

02:22.200 --> 02:25.330
你认为呢?
What do you think?!

03:01.430 --> 03:04.930
小心 小心!

03:20.530 --> 03:23.230

Nobody move!

03:23.300 --> 03:24.580
都不准动
Nobody move!

03:25.800 --> 03:28.190
真高兴又见到你了 孩子
Oh,good to see you again,boy.

03:29.070 --> 03:30.980
大家都不想受伤 老大
No need for anyoneto get hurt,Boss.

03:31.630 --> 03:34.850
老大?  这里再也用不着讲礼貌了
Boss? Oh,there's no need for formalities anymore there,Sink.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.720
我再也不是公务员了
I'm no longer an employee of the state,

03:36.730 --> 03:38.090
都是拜你所赐
thanks to you.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.190
我想是有人想要那笔赏金
I think somebody wants that reward.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.050
这跟赏金无关 伙计
Oh,it's not about reward money,friend.

03:43.060 --> 03:44.620
你的朋友曼彻全都告诉我了
Your pal Manche told me

03:44.630 --> 03:46.850
关于韦斯特莫兰德隐藏的
all about your little treasure hunt

03:46.860 --> 03:48.850
小小的寻宝游戏
for Westmoreland's stash.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.500
上车
Get in the car.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.890
我们要去犹他州了
We're going to Utah.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.190
这里所有的警察都在找你们
All the cops following you all over the country,

04:32.200 --> 04:34.790
但是都是追着你们的尾巴跑
when all they had to do was tail the tail,you know?

04:34.800 --> 04:37.590
走快点 我的摇钱树
Let's move it,convict.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.990
既然你们已经知道犹他的那笔钱 为什么还需要我们
If you know about the money in Utah,why do you need us?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.090
越狱太过紧张
Well,the excitement of the escape,

04:42.100 --> 04:43.590
在那老家伙挂之前
Manche didn't hear everything Westmoreland said

04:43.600 --> 04:45.590
曼彻没把韦斯特莫兰德的话都听完
before the old bird kicked the bucket,

04:45.600 --> 04:47.960
但是他听清楚了 犹他和五百万
but he heard enough: Utah and five million.

04:47.970 --> 04:49.940
加上你们就够了
You'll fill in the blanks.

04:51.070 --> 04:53.130
别在这里装腔作势 傻瓜
Don't even think about getting cute,smart-ass.

04:53.140 --> 04:54.760
现在你和你哥哥带我们
Now,you and your brother are gonna take me

04:54.770 --> 04:56.090
去找那笔钱
right to where that money is,

04:56.100 --> 04:59.100
否则这婊子就死得很快
or the whore gets dead real fast.

04:59.170 --> 05:01.150
不信就试试看
Ask me if I'm bluffing.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.740
从斯科菲尔德公寓底下那条河里
The dredging of the river beneath Scofield's apartment

05:15.750 --> 05:16.890
找到一些东西
bore some fruit.

05:18.170 --> 05:20.490
河床底找到一个硬盘
Found a hard drive under the river bed.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.530
上面的序列号
Serial numbers match an order

05:21.540 --> 05:23.130
跟他进监狱前几个月
that Scofield put in with Dell

05:23.140 --> 05:24.530
购买的戴尔电脑相吻合
a few months before he was incarcerated.

05:24.540 --> 05:29.340
现在他们恢复了上面12%的数据
They've recovered about 12 percent of the data so far.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.190
这个对我们有什么帮助
And this is helping us how?

05:49.200 --> 05:50.330
血液检验已经出来了
Blood tests came back.

05:50.340 --> 05:52.760
爆炸地点都是B型
B-negative all over that crash site.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.390
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯也都是...
Scofield and Burrows are both...

05:54.400 --> 05:55.790
B型 -我知道
B-negative. -I know.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.260
我去联系媒体
I'll reach out to the media.

05:57.270 --> 05:59.260
别忙这么做
How about don't.

05:59.270 --> 06:02.570
如果我们对外宣称策划越狱的
If it gets out that the guy who...

06:02.870 --> 06:06.230
主犯可能已经死了
...who masterminded this whole thing is possibly dead,

06:06.240 --> 06:08.230
其他六个家伙就会更加警觉
the other six cons are gonna get their guards up even more.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.060
我们的策略是 抱歉...
It is our policy-- excuse me...

06:10.070 --> 06:11.430
我们的策略是
It is our policy

06:11.440 --> 06:13.960
在确认他们死亡之前先别声张
<i>not</i> to announce deaths until they're confirmed!

06:16.040 --> 06:18.290
我们已经看到汽车爆炸和血液检测
We've got an exploding car and a blood match.

06:18.300 --> 06:19.390
那就做更多检验
Well,then do more tests.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.660
对什么做检验?
On what?

06:20.670 --> 06:22.360
对汽车保险杆 我不知道 也不在乎
On the bumper. I don't know. I don't care.

06:22.370 --> 06:24.660
先别忙 我想让外面的那些家伙
Just delay. I want those guys out there

06:24.670 --> 06:26.290
更得意 而不是更小心
getting more complacent,not more careful.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.560
继续向他们的核计划迈进
<i>...to forge ahead with its nuclear program.</i>

06:32.570 --> 06:35.060
国内新闻 从福克斯河监狱
In national news,the eight escaped convicts

06:35.070 --> 06:37.130
越狱的8名逃犯
from Fox River Penitentiary in Illinois

06:37.140 --> 06:39.730
目前仍在逃中...

You like John Denver?

Take me home

07:01.900 --> 07:05.960
到你的家
To your place

07:05.970 --> 07:09.090
我有现钞...
I've got cash

07:11.500 --> 07:13.660
西弗吉尼亚
In West Virginia

07:13.670 --> 07:19.060
带我回家 我的乡村妓女
Take me home,my country ho...

07:19.070 --> 07:20.230
不错 很不错
This is good,this is good.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.860
歌唱的不错 都可以弃学专业当歌手了
Don't quit your day job.

07:21.870 --> 07:24.130
什么
What?

07:24.140 --> 07:27.690
通常我是喝点龙舌兰酒才开始K歌
Nah,I just need a little tequila to get my karaoke on.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.940
不错
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:32.200 --> 07:35.400
慢着 减速
Here,yo,slow down.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.030
我们现在只有65码 限速60...
We're doing,like,65 in a 60...

07:38.040 --> 07:39.730
减速
Yo,slow down.

07:39.740 --> 07:42.740
好吧 老兄
All right,Dad.

07:46.970 --> 07:49.130
我们不能被查到 伙计
Yo,we can't be having that,man.

07:49.140 --> 07:51.690
开张罚单就是200美刀
Tickets are,like,200 bones.

07:51.700 --> 07:55.270
是啊
Yeah.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.730
我从没想过要说这句话 斯科菲尔德
I never thought I'd say this,Scofield,

07:58.740 --> 08:01.390
我真的感谢上帝让你来到福克斯河
but I thank God for the day you walked into Fox River.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.060
然后又逃了出去
And out of it.

08:04.870 --> 08:06.260
没事的
It's gonna be okay.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.620
我可不想听你说这句话
I don't want to hear from you right now.

08:10.230 --> 08:11.380
你告诉我什么都不会发生
You told me nothing would happen.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.410
你向我保证了
You promised me.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.580
她生气了
That's one pissed off commie

08:18.580 --> 08:20.530
你可得自己解决 斯科菲尔德
you got on your hands there,Scofield.

08:21.290 --> 08:22.960
你妈妈没告诉你怎么对待一个女人吗?
Didn't your mama tell you how to treat a lady?

08:23.540 --> 08:25.700
还是她自己就是这样的一个婊子 林肯
Or was she a whore like this one? Linc!

08:26.210 --> 08:27.460
有问题吗 布伦斯
Got a problem there,Burrows?

08:28.060 --> 08:29.170
我们只需要你们中的一个
We only need one of you

08:29.180 --> 08:30.430
带我们去找那笔钱

08:35.240 --> 08:37.190

这是我第一次
And this was the first time

08:41.900 --> 08:44.050

08:59.250 --> 09:00.270
我想谈一下
Actually,I'd like to...

09:19.640 --> 09:21.760
一点点耗光的
gave out.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.660
就像我的外祖父 我的姐姐一样
Just like my grandfather did,just like my sister did.

09:24.670 --> 09:27.160
如果任其发展下去  我也一样
Just like I...

09:27.170 --> 09:30.560

How was your flight?

10:11.270 --> 10:12.830

10:12.840 --> 10:13.890
一切都准备好了吧?

我膀胱小
I have a small bladder.

22:25.030 --> 22:27.040
你们不会都这样吧
That ain't all you got.

22:32.670 --> 22:34.550
起来
Get up.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.920
怎么样?
Well?

22:44.930 --> 22:46.220
他们计划设陷抓你
They plan to trap you.

22:46.230 --> 22:49.020
那个大个子  他在犹他有些朋友
The big one-- he's got friends in Utah.

22:49.030 --> 22:50.290
都是罪犯
Criminals.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.360
一个叫潘圭里奇的小镇
A town called Panguitch.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.390
他们在那里的农场种大麻
They grow drugs on the farm there.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.290
还会告诉你钱在那里 但实际上没有
They'll tell you that's where the money is,but no money.

22:57.300 --> 23:00.960
只有拿着枪的老朋友 在那恭候你大驾
Just old friends with guns,waiting for you.

23:00.970 --> 23:02.760
那很简单
Easy enough.

23:02.770 --> 23:05.280
我们借道潘圭里奇
We take a pass on Panguitch.

23:08.780 --> 23:10.030
钱到底在哪?
Where's the money really?

23:10.400 --> 23:13.060
我会尽快找出来
I'll find out soon enough.

23:13.070 --> 23:16.760
不过现在20万美金是旧行情了
But $200,000 was old price for this information.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.120
我要个新价钱
I want a new price.

23:19.130 --> 23:21.390
你又在和我讨价还价
She's trying to renegotiate.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.090
如果不是我
If it wasn't for me,

23:23.100 --> 23:25.460
你就会倒毙在大麻地里
you'd be face down in a marijuana farm.

23:27.210 --> 23:28.220
三分之一
One third.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.260
那消息可不值这个价
Ha!It's gonna take a lot more than information

23:32.270 --> 23:34.760
如果你想分到三分之一 小宝贝
if you want a million-six,sweet pea.

23:34.770 --> 23:36.260
要做什么?
Such as?

23:36.270 --> 23:38.220
你知道的
You know.

23:38.230 --> 23:41.490
我一直都想要的那个
Piece of that can anytime I want it.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.820
就是那个?
Is that it?

23:42.830 --> 23:44.560
你不打算打我一巴掌吗?
Aren't you gonna slap me?

23:44.570 --> 23:47.660
我和很多男人都睡过觉  相信我
I've slept with men for a lot less,trust me.

23:47.670 --> 23:50.320
那么你说过的"想都别想"如何解释呢?
And what happened to "never in a 1,000 years?"

23:50.330 --> 23:52.310
那是谈判
That was negotiating.

23:57.710 --> 23:58.830
那么
So.

24:00.860 --> 24:01.630
成交了?
Deal?

24:04.120 --> 24:05.070
成交
Deal.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.010
我找到15万美金的现金 约翰
<i>We got a $150,000 here,John.</i>

24:16.020 --> 24:17.640
就在维托利奥在索拉纳斯的住处找到的
With Vittorio's place in Solanas,

24:17.650 --> 24:19.780
我们靠这些利息都能过活了
we'll be able to live off the interest.

24:22.090 --> 24:22.960
你们的父亲呢?
Where's your father?

24:31.440 --> 24:32.350
都好了吗 老大?
<i>Everything all right,boss?</i>

24:33.460 --> 24:34.160
是的
Yeah.

24:35.450 --> 24:36.610
让我们把这档事了结了...
Let's get this over with...

这样我就能回到家人身边了
so I can get back to my family.

24:42.340 --> 24:43.600
她能搞定的
She'll get it done.

24:44.780 --> 24:46.570
妮卡和我共同经历了很多
Nika and I have come too far together.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.870
当钱就在眼前 你就不能相信任何人
When money's on the line,you trust no one.

24:48.880 --> 24:49.910
有时候你必须相信
Sometimes you have to.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.410
如果你想活命 你就不能
Not if you want to survive,you don't.

24:52.420 --> 24:54.870
你真的谁也不相信 是吗?
You really don't trust anyone,do you?

24:54.880 --> 24:58.610
在发生那么多事后 你还来责问我?
Can you blame me after all that's happened?

24:58.620 --> 25:00.180
不 我是说在那之前
No,I mean before that.

25:01.480 --> 25:02.740
进监狱之前
Before prison.

25:02.750 --> 25:05.070
每当我相信某人  我都会受伤
Every time I trusted someone,I got burned.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.120
每当我接近某人 我就会受到不公的对待
Every time I got close to someone,I got screwed.

25:10.980 --> 25:13.540
这点我很清楚 你也应该是
I know better,and so should you.

25:13.550 --> 25:14.780
没错 就是莲花旅馆
<i>That's right,the Lotus Motel.</i>

25:15.960 --> 25:16.930
我不知道电话号码
<i>I don't know the number.</i>

25:17.740 --> 25:19.220
我不能再说下去了 我得挂了
I can't talk anymore; I have to go.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.670
噢 听着
Oh,check it.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.470
我知道这可能有点冒昧
I-I know this might be a little forward and all,

25:33.480 --> 25:35.510
不过 让我
but,um,let me

25:35.520 --> 25:37.440
问你点事

No. What am I thinking? You're Mormon...

25:43.720 --> 25:45.340
我不是
I'm not Mormon.

25:45.350 --> 25:47.840

You think all girls from Utah are Mormons?

25:50.960 --> 25:51.820

They are,aren't they?

I was an ass before. I apologize.

what were the odds that you were actually a doctor?

26:28.980 --> 26:31.210
噢 可以了 够了
Uh,all right,fair enough.

26:31.220 --> 26:33.510

27:21.870 --> 27:23.790
我们可以一起去犹他州
we could have kept going on toward Utah.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.720
白天阳光明媚 可以四处走走
Lots of light left in the day,lots of road to go.

27:29.660 --> 27:31.340
爸爸停下来的时候  我们就不走了
When Dad's back acts up,we stop.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.040

我是说你已是个成熟的女人了
I mean,you're a grown woman.

27:44.210 --> 27:48.650
不过大人们总是把
But adults are always trying to infantilize girls your age,

27:48.660 --> 27:50.160
你这个年纪的姑娘当作孩子来看待
treat you like children.

27:51.150 --> 27:51.760
别说笑了
No duh.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.950
我爸爸不让我戴耳环 而且我只有14岁

和我爸爸去说吧
Tell my dad that.

28:01.410 --> 28:03.190
是啊 不过他听不进去 是吧?
Yeah,but he won't want to hear it,right?

28:04.230 --> 28:08.140
因为他想让你一直是个小孩子
Because he wants to keep you as a baby.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.830
对吗? 即便
Right? Even though

28:12.620 --> 28:14.730

怎么打扮

28:23.770 --> 28:24.650

She's got it all wrong.

28:40.190 --> 28:41.100
在外面等着
Go wait outside.

28:52.170 --> 28:53.560

You and I are gonna work this out.

28:55.180 --> 28:58.680
杰瑞... 你不能这么做
Jerry... you really don't want to do this.

29:02.850 --> 29:06.180
我欣赏你的直接
Thing I like about you is your determination.

29:08.140 --> 29:10.510
我在克拉德诺的家人还在等我
I've got family in Kladno that have been waiting for me

29:10.520 --> 29:12.000
给他们寄钱去

29:12.630 --> 29:14.140
他们知道你现在在做什么吗?
They know what kind of work you're in?

29:16.610 --> 29:18.900
他们以为我在星巴克工作
They think I work at Starbuck's.

29:27.070 --> 29:29.240
你以为我有多蠢?
How stupid do you think I am?

29:38.960 --> 29:41.500
我爸爸总是说 "你耍我一次 我羞辱还你
My daddy always said,"Fool me once,shame on you.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.520
再耍我一次 就把你打翻在地"
Fool me twice,and I put you in the ground."

29:44.990 --> 29:45.900
再耍花样
Any more games,

29:45.910 --> 29:47.690
我就拧断这婊子的脖子 明白吗?

29:55.750 --> 29:57.140
谢谢你的舞蹈 小宝贝
Thanks for the dance,sweet pea.

Put your hands behind your back.

30:34.870 --> 30:35.630
谢谢
Thank you.

30:36.130 --> 30:38.200
你知道你和那个医生一样蠢吗?
You're as stupid as the prison doc,you know that?

30:38.210 --> 30:39.470
别理他
Ignore him.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.740
他也玩弄了她 让她误以为他爱上了自己
He conned her,too. Made her think he loved her,

30:41.740 --> 30:42.640
看看她都得到了些什么
and look what she got.

An overdose and a shot at 30 years inside.

30:48.860 --> 30:49.810

我想你还没有看过报纸吧
Guess you haven't been reading the papers,

30:52.280 --> 30:53.340
看过吗 大学生?
have you,college boy?

30:53.670 --> 30:55.300
警方发现你女朋友的时候
Cops found your girlfriend--

30:55.300 --> 30:58.120
已经眼睛翻白 口吐白沫
fish-belly white,garglin' her own puke.

30:59.100 --> 30:59.880
闭嘴
Shut up.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.140
但是你又关心过她吗?
But what do you care,

31:01.150 --> 31:03.360
自从她给你留了门后
a long as she leftthe door open for you?

31:03.360 --> 31:04.210
闭嘴!
Shut up!

31:04.810 --> 31:06.130
说到你痛处了吧?
Hit a sore spot,didn't I?

31:35.760 --> 31:37.360
这是我吃过的最好的派了
It really is like the best pie I've ever had.

31:39.260 --> 31:40.690
你知道怎么才能做个派吗?
You know what it needs though... Hmm?

31:41.280 --> 31:42.350
一些脆皮饼  （注：还可解释为强效可卡因，一语双关）
Some crack.

31:43.930 --> 31:45.220
不 我的意思是说不用很多
No,I mean,you know,not a lot.

31:45.560 --> 31:46.230
一小撮
A pinch.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.190
一小撮脆皮饼?  一小撮脆皮饼
A pinch of crack? A pinch of crack.

31:48.930 --> 31:50.480
一小撮脆皮饼 一小口咂咂
A pinch of crack,a dollop of smack.

31:50.990 --> 31:51.900
美味
Mm.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.180
那就做成了一个好吃的派
That's good pie.

31:54.050 --> 31:55.080
那可大错特错了
That's so wrong.

31:55.090 --> 31:55.710
不是吗?
No?

31:58.820 --> 31:59.430
抱歉 接个电话
I'm sorry.

32:04.220 --> 32:04.790

32:09.640 --> 32:10.310
你要怎样?
What do you want?

32:11.730 --> 32:13.110
我没有时间和你说
I don't have time to talk.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.190
而且很可能
And there's every chance

32:15.190 --> 32:16.810
他们正监听着这通电话
they're listening to this call right now,

32:16.820 --> 32:18.570
但是我还是有很多话想对你说
but there's a lot I want to say.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.210
请不要挂电话
Please don't hang up on me.

32:21.210 --> 32:23.460
我不想...我不想和你说下去了
I don't... I don't want to talk to you.

32:23.910 --> 32:24.840
我听说了...
I heard about...

32:27.590 --> 32:28.750

32:38.170 --> 32:38.960
对所发生的一切
for everything.

32:39.530 --> 32:42.870
一声抱歉对我所处的现状根本于事无补
Sorry's not going to do me a whole lot of good with what I'm up against right now.

32:43.210 --> 32:43.900
听着...
Listen...

32:46.340 --> 32:49.050
任何与我及我哥哥关联的人

32:49.060 --> 32:50.170

32:50.850 --> 32:52.860
我和你及你哥哥再无任何瓜葛
I have no ties to you and your brother anymore.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.010
我有个法子可以保护你
There is a way I can protect you.

已经在你那里了
It's already in your possession.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.790

我还没有这么舒服地洗过澡
Yo,I haven't taken a shower like that

33:41.480 --> 33:42.350

33:45.560 --> 33:46.570

I was going to surprise you.

33:47.180 --> 33:48.190

33:54.830 --> 33:55.960
呆在这儿 放轻松就行
Stay here and relax.

33:57.340 --> 33:58.460
你看上去有些紧张
You seem kind of nervous.

34:00.670 --> 34:01.520
是的 你都出汗了
Yeah,you're sweating.

34:02.760 --> 34:03.860
或许我是有些紧张
Maybe I am nervous.

34:04.630 --> 34:06.810
相信我  你什么都不用担心 好吗?
Trust me,girl,you got nothing to worry about,all right?

34:08.210 --> 34:09.140
我是个好人
I'm one of the good guys.

34:10.340 --> 34:11.130
看起来是个好人
You seem like it.

34:49.850 --> 34:50.720
别熄火
Hang on tight.

34:50.730 --> 34:53.120
-我让经理把门打开了 -好的
I had the manager unlock the door. Gotcha.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.170
如果你是在找菲波纳奇的话 约翰
If you're looking for the rat,John...

35:37.760 --> 35:39.560
他就在离这2000英里的地方
Fibonacci's 2,000 miles from here.

35:44.060 --> 35:44.790
你是谁?
Who are you?

35:46.780 --> 35:48.300

联邦调查局的 约翰
Feds,John,

35:50.020 --> 35:52.580
对付你这种大佬只能派最精干的警察
only roll out the best for a man of your stature.

35:57.010 --> 35:59.270
我要知道是谁出卖了我
I deserve to know who turned on me.

35:59.730 --> 36:00.320
告诉我
Tell me.

36:01.750 --> 36:03.580
这个男人现在进退两难
The man was facing a RICO rap.

36:05.390 --> 36:07.120
他不想进监狱
He did not want to go to prison.

36:07.860 --> 36:09.350
了解你现在的处境
I'm sure you can appreciate that,

36:09.350 --> 36:12.040
我想你会很感激的
knowing what you know about the place now.

36:12.740 --> 36:17.100
无论你现在想做什么 约翰...都别做
Whatever you're thinking about doing,John... don't.

36:22.140 --> 36:24.950
你今天就得回到福克斯河  或者是太平间...
You are going back to Fox River today,or the morgue...

36:25.390 --> 36:26.110
决定权在你
that's your call.

36:33.560 --> 36:34.370

36:50.540 --> 36:51.280
放松 约翰
Easy,John.

36:52.780 --> 36:53.550
放松
Easy.

36:55.610 --> 36:56.820
他有武器 右手
We got a weapon,right hand.

36:56.820 --> 36:58.500
这些人可都不是好惹的
These are serious men here.

36:59.130 --> 37:01.600
你一有行动他们就会向你开枪
They have instructions to shoot at the first sign of aggression.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.330
拜托
Please.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.950
我在和你谈 很恭敬地
I'm asking you,respectfully,

37:05.360 --> 37:06.130
放下武器
drop the weapon,

37:07.460 --> 37:09.730
跪下 把手放在脑后
kneel and put your hands on your head.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.720
我只向上帝下跪
I kneel only to God.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.260
我没看见他在这
I don't see Him here.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.030
约翰!
John!

37:54.010 --> 37:55.100
我想我把事搞砸了
<i>I think I screwed up.</i>

我父亲是空军上校
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

37:58.230 --> 37:59.280
控制欲极强
Total Nazi.

37:59.710 --> 38:00.380
他就是那种
One of those...

38:00.390 --> 38:02.460
令人窒息的严密控管型父亲
nightmare overprotective dads. Mmm-hmm.

38:04.140 --> 38:04.810
然后呢?
Yeah?

38:04.820 --> 38:05.870
我给他打了电话
Well,I called him.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.220
我告诉他我和你一起在旅途中
Told him I was traveling with you.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.620
我还告诉他我们睡在一个房间里
I told him that we were staying in the same hotel room.

38:16.510 --> 38:18.070
-傻丫头  -什么?
Girl. What?

38:19.300 --> 38:20.890
你该学学如何撒谎
You got to learn how to lie,girl.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.450
你觉得呢?
What you thinking? I don't...

38:22.460 --> 38:25.640
没错  出于某种原因 我还真不会撒谎
Yeah,I-- for some reason I don't know how.

38:26.950 --> 38:29.840
当我告诉他我和一个男人在宾馆开房
He-he was mad enough when I told him I was staying

38:29.850 --> 38:31.160
他抓狂不已
in a hotel room with a guy,

38:31.990 --> 38:33.090
-这是一回事...  -然后呢
that was one thing... Yeah,yeah.

38:33.090 --> 38:34.110
但是当我告诉他
but when I told him I was staying in a hotel

38:34.110 --> 38:35.450
我和一男人在宾馆开房时
with a guy that...

38:35.460 --> 38:37.360
我或许就像那种...
I maybe sort of liked...

38:38.600 --> 38:39.440
他再也管不了我了
he lost it.

38:43.740 --> 38:44.600
等等
Wait.

38:45.250 --> 38:46.180
等什么?
Wait,what?

38:46.910 --> 38:47.680
你没事吧?
Is that okay?

39:03.060 --> 39:04.450
至少让我们把你送到镇上吧
<i>At least let us take you into town.</i>

39:06.630 --> 39:07.500
不用了
No.

39:08.040 --> 39:08.940
如果我被发现和你在一起
If I'm seen with you,

39:08.940 --> 39:10.510
那就麻烦大了
it's a lot of trouble for me.

39:11.460 --> 39:12.900
我能步行过去 只有一里路而已
I can walk; it's only a mile.

39:13.630 --> 39:15.120
没有你的帮助 我们到不了现在这步
We never would've made it this far without you.

39:16.510 --> 39:18.490
但是你会丢下我
But now you're crossing the border...

39:19.080 --> 39:19.830
穿过边境...
without me.

39:20.610 --> 39:22.210
你不能和我们一起去那儿
You can't go where we're going.

39:23.180 --> 39:24.420
因为那不是你的人生
It's not a life for you.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.130
如果说那就是我的人生呢
Then that's it then.

39:31.970 --> 39:32.930
好吧  一切都结束了
It's over for good.

39:35.260 --> 39:35.830
谢谢
Thank you.

39:38.190 --> 39:38.880
注意安全
Be safe.

39:46.500 --> 39:47.160
好运
Good luck.

39:55.130 --> 39:56.220
我爱过你 迈克尔
I loved you,Michael.

39:57.910 --> 39:59.800
我想我应该放弃这段感情
And I thought I was going to get that back,

39:59.810 --> 40:01.240
你仅仅是利用我而已
but you just used me.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.200
不是那样的
That's not true.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.230
我应该比这得到的更多
I deserve more than this.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.320
绝对不止仅当个
I deserve more than just being the girl

40:06.320 --> 40:08.210
你需要帮忙 就一个电话过来的女子
that you call when you need something.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.390
你真的认为你能在犹他州找到那笔钱?
You really think you're gonna find the money in Utah?

40:10.390 --> 40:12.400
我根本不在乎埋在犹他州的钱!
I don't care about the money in Utah!

40:14.240 --> 40:15.810
我不想再犯罪了
I don't want any more crime.

40:17.020 --> 40:19.870
我把你们抓起来 我就能得到20万
I turn you in,I get $200,000.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.160
合法的钱
Legal money.

40:27.890 --> 40:29.450
现在就把你们交给警方
You're the policemen's problem now.

40:29.790 --> 40:32.900
-妮卡... -别再靠过来 不然我就开枪了!
Nika... Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you!

40:34.280 --> 40:34.950
不 你开不了枪
No,you won't.

41:05.310 --> 41:06.200
祝你好运
Good luck to you.

41:35.100 --> 41:36.090
呃 总部来电
Um,HQ called.

41:36.100 --> 41:38.470
询问你为什么不在阿布鲁奇
They're asking why you didn't intercept Abruzzi

41:38.470 --> 41:40.110
走向汽车旅馆的时候就中途截住他
when he was walking towards the motel.

41:41.220 --> 41:42.520
这家伙是黑帮老大
The man was a mob boss.

41:42.530 --> 41:44.060
正确的行动就是困住他
The right move was to get him trapped.

41:44.630 --> 41:46.030
他们说你这么做
They're saying the way you played it,

41:46.030 --> 41:47.860
结果只有一个
there was only one possible outcome.

41:47.870 --> 41:49.430
总部对我的行动有异议的话
HQ has a problem with the way I do things,

41:49.430 --> 41:50.060
那下次让他们也拿起枪
they can pick up a gun

41:50.060 --> 41:51.730
跟着我到现场处理
and follow me into the field next time.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.240
斯科菲尔德一直知道菲波纳奇是吊住阿布鲁奇的关键
Scofield always knew the rat was the key to Abruzzi.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.610
我们偏偏把这个诱饵公布出来 这样阿布鲁奇就会上钩了
We just put it out on the wire and Abruzzi bit.

42:15.310 --> 42:16.420
说到斯科菲尔德...
Speaking of Scofield...

42:17.470 --> 42:18.620
撞车是设计好的障眼法
That crash was staged.

42:26.450 --> 42:27.110
是猪血
Pig blood.

42:30.060 --> 42:30.850
真狡猾啊
Smart kid.

42:37.100 --> 42:38.310
问题是...
The problem with...

42:40.030 --> 42:41.740
太过狡猾迟早会
being that clever is that sooner or later,

42:41.740 --> 42:43.770
聪明反被聪明误
you end up getting too clever for your own good.

42:50.470 --> 42:51.120
晚安
Good night.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.590
你自己都不清楚会面对什么
You've no idea what you're in for.
