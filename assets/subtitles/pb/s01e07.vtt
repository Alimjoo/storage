00:46.510 --> 00:48.880
不点名的唯一方法是 禁闭
The only way to stop counting is a lockdown.

00:48.890 --> 00:51.750
你需要把这里的人激怒
You'd better get the inmates riled up.

一切尽在我们的掌控 州长
We have everything under control.

01:29.540 --> 01:33.250

You'd better hope you do.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.870

03:31.430 --> 03:33.420
早就让他们渴得受不了了
The stink alone should drive 'em out of there.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.110
你认为那样起作用?
You think that's gonna work?

03:35.120 --> 03:37.110
不  但这是一定要做的
No, but it's protocol.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.570

09:09.790 --> 09:11.750
我们准备降落
We are making our final approach

09:11.760 --> 09:15.300
华盛顿

09:15.640 --> 09:18.280

谁想要特伦斯·斯蒂德曼死掉

09:20.530 --> 09:23.440
那个从华盛顿打的电话 它没让你获得什么吗
The call came from DC.What does that tell you?

09:23.450 --> 09:25.730
我觉得除了与政府有关的人
You gotta think past the government.

09:25.740 --> 09:29.850
任何人都有可能 商业伙伴或是竞争者
Anybody could be here.A business partner, a rival.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.260

Before Steadman was killed,

09:31.270 --> 09:36.830
艾克菲尔公司在技术大会上推行了一种新的电力引擎
EcoField introduced a prototype electric engine at the techno conference.

09:36.840 --> 09:40.760
要是那个成了主流 没人再会去买60美圆一桶的原油
$60 barrels of oil would be obsolete if that thing ever hit the mainstream.

09:40.770 --> 09:43.700
可能是石油公司
Could be oil. Oil companies.

供应商 客户 两者之间都有可能
Suppliers, consumers, everything in between.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.880
或是依赖于石油的政府
Or the government of an oil-based economy.

09:51.890 --> 09:54.220
例如美国
Like the United States.

09:54.230 --> 09:56.560

09:56.570 --> 09:59.730

降落之后 我需要见我的朋友
At any rate, we land, we meet my guy,

10:02.790 --> 10:05.270
即使我们找不到那个打电话的人
and even if we don't find the person who tipped off the cops,

10:05.280 --> 10:07.060
最好也能从警察那找到这个电话
we find his phone.

10:07.070 --> 10:11.110
然后从纸面上接着找
The paper trail begins.

11:52.290 --> 11:55.030
州长来了
That's the governor.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.160
不管发生什么 啥也别说
Whatever happens, don't say anything.

12:22.010 --> 12:24.180

12:24.190 --> 12:27.060
现在我必须告知您 自从我们结束谈话之后 情况又进一步升级

废话少说 狱长
Just cut the crap, Warden,

12:31.350 --> 12:36.160

13:14.750 --> 13:17.880
-这个一定是你的女儿  -放回去
-This here must be your daughter.  -Put it back.

13:17.890 --> 13:21.800
舞会上?
Prom?

13:23.520 --> 13:28.990
你知道人们对于舞会上的衣服是怎么看的 对不?
You know what they say about a prom dress, don't you?

13:30.700 --> 13:34.700
她那晚没回家 对吗?
She didn't come home that night, did she?

13:34.710 --> 13:40.720
不 她整晚都穿着它
No, she wore that all night long.

13:40.730 --> 13:46.380
第二天早上还要把那身服装丢进汽车旅馆之后的垃圾箱 
Next morning she had to throw that dress in the trash can behind the motel

13:46.390 --> 13:51.350
这样她妈妈就看不到...
so her momma didn't see...

13:51.360 --> 13:52.450

13:52.460 --> 13:58.200
我只是和他在闲聊女儿 你知道...谈论女人

14:06.130 --> 14:09.380
你不许动他一根寒毛

14:09.390 --> 14:15.430
我们都身陷其中了知道吗
We're locked into this thing now.Understand?

14:27.320 --> 14:30.780

16:46.320 --> 16:48.780

-这对你没什么影响吧?  -别把我拉进去
-if that's all right with you?  -Leave me out of this.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.250
没把你拉进去
I am leaving you out of it.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.120
从我见到你的那天起我就没要把你拉进去
I left you out of it the day I met you.

18:47.130 --> 18:47.740
好了
Ok

18:47.750 --> 18:50.570
因为我和妈妈的任何事情都与你无关
Nothing in her life or mine has anything to do with you.

18:50.580 --> 18:53.160
-我可以假装没听到  -是吗?听到那又怎么样
-I'll pretend I didn't hear that.  -Yeah? Or what?

18:53.170 --> 18:54.500

-Honey...  -Leave me alone!

19:05.490 --> 19:06.720
-滚开  -你他妈在干什么
-Get off me.  -What are you doing?!

19:06.730 --> 19:09.460
-不许这样和她说话  -住手
-Don't touch your mother like that.  -Stop it.

19:09.470 --> 19:12.760
住手

-You love that man?  -Just go.

19:19.010 --> 19:23.180
-你爱那个人  -照我说的做
-You love that man?  -Do what I say.

19:46.530 --> 19:50.900
土耳其人 为什么要这样  谁指使的
Turk, why are you doing this? Who sent you?

19:50.910 --> 19:54.920
为什么  为什么
Why? Why?

20:29.040 --> 20:30.920
为什么你要这样做
Why did you do this?

20:30.930 --> 20:33.290
怎么回事? 谁指使的
What's it all about? Who sent you?

20:33.300 --> 20:35.070
你必须帮我
Aren't you gonna help me?

20:35.080 --> 20:39.760
你必须帮我 求你
You've gotta help me. Please.

20:39.900 --> 20:43.550

21:15.160 --> 21:16.640

21:16.650 --> 21:19.030
你他妈吓到我了
You scared the hell out of me.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.030
你在和谁说话
Who are you talking to?

21:21.040 --> 21:23.130
这是嫩鸡的点子
It's the fish's idea.

21:23.140 --> 21:26.040
用魔鬼在墙上做标记来钻孔
The devil marks the wall so you know where to drill the holes.

21:26.050 --> 21:28.120
你们用鸡蛋搅拌器挖洞?
You're making holes with an egg beater?

21:28.130 --> 21:30.300
我知道 很疯狂 啊?
I know ,Crazy, huh?

21:30.310 --> 21:32.420
这个叫胡克定律
It's called the Hooker Law.

21:32.430 --> 21:36.370
就是说如果你在又大又硬的东西上挖几个准确的洞
He says that if you poke the exact right holes in something big and strong,

21:36.380 --> 21:38.840
它会变的很脆弱
it gets very weak.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.800
真的
That's true.

21:40.810 --> 21:45.060
当墙变脆弱 我们就能推倒它
When the wall is weak, we can take it down.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.220
至少计划是这样
At least that's the plan.

21:47.230 --> 21:52.050
这通常是计划
Yeah. That's always the plan.

21:52.060 --> 21:55.690
你不要低估一面墙
You should never underestimate a wall.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.130
你知道

21:57.140 --> 22:00.420
有时 不管你多努力的尝试
sometimes, no matter how hard you try,

22:00.430 --> 22:05.650
它都不低头
it just won't give in.

22:15.680 --> 22:20.490
-你还好吗  -好的 我很好
-Are you all right?  -I'm OK. I'm fine.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.360
别让他们走了
Don't let 'em get away.

22:33.830 --> 22:36.760
休息一分钟 对不起
You know what? I need a minute. I'm sorry.

22:36.770 --> 22:39.780
-已经不远了  -就一会儿
-It's not much further.  -Just a sec.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.920
如果你想调整呼吸那么咱们可以停下
We can stop if you want. Catch your breath.

22:42.930 --> 22:47.510
那么一分钟
OK. Yeah, I could use a minute.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.100

22:49.110 --> 22:52.440

不久就会有武装力量进入
Pretty soon, the powers that will be break in

22:55.460 --> 22:59.690

22:59.700 --> 23:03.790
到底发生什么事情
What's happening in A-Wing?

23:03.800 --> 23:07.020
所有人都在乱逃
All hell's breaking loose.

23:07.030 --> 23:11.940
但我认为在这里是安全的
But I think if we stay up here,we should be OK.

23:11.950 --> 23:14.520
不敢相信发生这种事
I can't believe this is happening.

23:14.530 --> 23:16.020
来这里
Yeah. Come here.

23:16.030 --> 23:18.060
你感觉真不错 医生

23:38.520 --> 23:41.300

23:49.650 --> 23:52.250
你去过泰国吗 泰国很美
You ever been to Thailand? Thailand's great.

23:52.260 --> 23:56.830
迈克尔,如果你是在安慰我 你做的很差
Michael, if you're trying to calm me down,you're doing a terrible job.

23:56.840 --> 24:00.760
但我在努力
But I am trying.

24:01.550 --> 24:03.630
听见什么吗
Shh! You hear that?

24:03.640 --> 24:08.220
-你怎么会在这里  -你什么意思
-Why are you here?  -What do you mean?

24:08.230 --> 24:11.560
在天花板上走来走去 这很危险
Crawling around in the ceiling,risking your life.

24:11.570 --> 24:14.450
你需要帮助 然后...
You needed help and...

24:14.460 --> 24:18.930
我就来找到你
I came to find you.

24:22.030 --> 24:26.240
你如何知道怎么走
How did you know where to go?

24:27.560 --> 24:30.340
那个区域失去控制时 狱警们把监控室空了出来
When everything went off in A-Wing, the COs

24:30.350 --> 24:32.290

One of my first assignments on PI,

24:33.800 --> 24:36.450

we were up here cleaning out toxic mould.

24:36.460 --> 24:41.590
花了些日子 所以我对这里的布局比较熟悉
Took days, so I'm kind of familiar with the layout.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.260
我希望你戴着面具
Hope you wore a mask.

24:44.270 --> 24:46.910

相信我 我们会以莎拉的安全为重
But believe me, Sara is our top priority.

25:55.010 --> 25:56.190
她到底在哪

26:02.480 --> 26:04.260

在僵持  长官  他们坚持不了多少时间拉

-僵持?!  -那里有１００度呢

他们快脱水了 我们尽量避免使用极端手段
They're almost out of water.We are trying to avoid doing anything extreme.

26:12.620 --> 26:16.700
这样 我不介意你使用暴力手段来把她救出来
I don't care if it takes a massacre to get her out of there.

26:16.710 --> 26:19.960
你明白吗?现在你如果不马上去 我来!
Do you understand me?If you're not going to do it, I am.

26:19.970 --> 26:24.110
队长 把命令传下去 准备进攻
Captain, spread the news you're going in.

26:24.120 --> 26:28.660

28:28.730 --> 28:31.960

28:31.970 --> 28:36.440
这些囚犯没有浪费时间 我们的狱警必须强硬起来
These inmates don't mess around.Us COs need to get tough.

28:36.450 --> 28:38.510
狱长是个好人
Warden Pope's a good guy,

28:38.520 --> 28:40.280
但是他有时候不明白
but he doesn't understand

28:40.290 --> 28:43.350
得使用强硬手段控制住局势
that you gotta grab the situation by the gonads and take control.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.100
你就会这么来做对不
And is that what you would do?

28:45.110 --> 28:47.580

29:01.470 --> 29:04.480
一家人要一起做破坏

29:04.490 --> 29:07.450
诀窍就是压迫
The whole trick is pressure.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.680
-我该从哪里...这里?  -是的

29:09.690 --> 29:10.940

29:14.260 --> 29:16.410
就象你什么的时候 你知道
Just like when you, you know...

29:16.420 --> 29:17.810
你得小心点
But you gotta be careful.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.580
-我知道  -不 我意思是
-Yeah, I know.  -I mean it.

29:19.590 --> 29:21.820
你...你一不小心就会碰到煤气管道
 One slip and you'll hit the gas pipe.

29:21.830 --> 29:23.570

29:40.370 --> 29:43.030
必须走这里 没别的路去探访室了
We have to. There's no other way.

29:43.040 --> 29:47.000

-This is it.  -No, it's not.

29:47.010 --> 29:49.170
-从这往回走  -没用
-It's back this way.  -This won't help.

29:49.180 --> 29:50.900
-相信我  -迈克尔 如果你错了
-Trust me.  -If you're wrong...

29:50.910 --> 29:54.390
我们没多少时间
We don't have time.

30:00.040 --> 30:05.060
不要太用力 不要...太轻
Not too hard. Not too soft.

30:05.070 --> 30:09.480
我是她这么大的时候 身上长了不少坏东西
When I was her age, I had such bad skin.

30:09.490 --> 30:14.440
他们叫它痤疮
Acne, they called it.

30:14.450 --> 30:20.210
她看起来就象那些嘲笑我的女孩一样
She looks just like all them girls that made fun of me.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.870
我杀掉你之后
After I kill you,

30:22.880 --> 30:26.520
我爬出这个洞 叫一辆豪华轿车
I'm gonna crawl out that hole and call me up a limousine

30:26.530 --> 30:32.230
我和你的宝贝女儿一同去舞会
and me and your baby's going to the prom.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.670
有没有莎拉的新消息
What's the news with Sara?

30:53.680 --> 30:54.860
我们正努力找她
Still trying to find her.

30:54.870 --> 30:57.300
-你们还不知道她在哪里?  -我们正在找
-You don't even know where she is?  -We're on it.

30:57.310 --> 31:00.270
一旦我们找到她马上告诉你
Once we do, we'll let you know.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.930
你早就该听贝利克队长的话封锁整个区域
You should listen to Captain Bellick and gas the whole block.

31:03.940 --> 31:05.460
贝利克队长?
Captain Bellick?

31:05.470 --> 31:08.270
他处在一线工作 他知道这些人会做什么
He knows what these guys can do.

31:08.280 --> 31:11.360
你最好祈祷莎拉能完好的出来
You'd better pray that Sara gets out in one piece.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.210
我会的 州长 但这还是我的监狱
I do, Governor, but this is still my prison.

31:14.220 --> 31:18.260
不管发生什么 我都会负全部责任
Whatever happens, I take full responsibility.

31:18.270 --> 31:21.670
抱歉

31:39.040 --> 31:42.020

31:50.110 --> 31:54.450

32:31.410 --> 32:32.590
但我不留下你

32:32.600 --> 32:35.980
你别无选择 我是一个坏人 不记得了?
You have no choice. I'm a bad guy. Remember?

32:35.990 --> 32:40.060
快 伙计 走走走
All right, go, man. Go, go, go!

32:46.910 --> 32:48.370
看见攻击者没有
Can you see the assailant?

32:48.380 --> 32:50.330
确定
Affirmative.

32:50.340 --> 32:53.660
我已经瞄准他了
I've got him in sight.

32:53.670 --> 32:56.120
你准备怎么做
What are you gonna do?

32:56.130 --> 32:58.850
回到房间  不插手任何事情
Go back to my cell. Stay out of the way.

32:58.860 --> 33:03.010

-Michael.  -What?

33:03.100 --> 33:06.730
他们发现我们拉
They see us.

33:08.030 --> 33:09.570
你必须走
You have to go.

33:09.580 --> 33:13.840
不行  他们会杀了你
I can't. They'll kill you.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.460
你走出这门
You go out the door.

33:28.470 --> 33:30.150
我趴到地上
I'll drop to the floor.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.230
他们是狙击手 迈克尔 不会脱靶的
They're sharpshooters. They won't miss.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.940
因为如此 你更不能停在这里
That's why you can't stay.

33:33.950 --> 33:36.300
-怎么样? -我来了医生
-What's going on?  -I'm coming, Doc.

33:36.310 --> 33:39.220
