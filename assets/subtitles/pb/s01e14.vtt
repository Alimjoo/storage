00:01.700 --> 00:03.250
我的名字叫迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
My name is Michael Scofield.

00:03.590 --> 00:07.670
我哥哥被诬陷并且替人背了黑锅而面临电刑
My brother is facing the electric chair framed for a crime he didn't commit.

00:08.280 --> 00:11.410
为什么特勤局对这个案子如此感兴趣?
What is it about this case that the Secret Service is so interested in?

00:11.640 --> 00:13.570
那家伙杀了副总统的弟弟
The man killed the Vice President's brother.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.770
在上诉失败后
After his appeals were exhausted

00:17.040 --> 00:19.610
我知道只有一个方法能救他
there was only one way to get him out

00:21.080 --> 00:23.980
我们是警察 放下你的所有武器
This is the police put down your weapon.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.440
迈克尔?
Michael?

00:28.700 --> 00:29.740
我要把你救出去
I'm getting you out of here.

00:29.930 --> 00:30.740
这不可能
It's impossible.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.590
除非这个监狱是你设计的
Not if you designed the place it isn't.

00:32.890 --> 00:34.100
你见过设计图?
You've seen the blueprints.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.870
不仅看过 我还把它纹到了身上
Better than that I've got them on me.

00:37.730 --> 00:40.110
我已在该监狱呆了将近一个月了
I've been at Fox River nearly a month now.

00:40.260 --> 00:45.420
在这期间我聚集了一帮人他们具有所有越狱所需的资源
In that time I've assembled a group that has all the resources.

00:45.570 --> 00:46.480
我是迈克尔
I'm Michael by the way.

00:46.670 --> 00:48.560
我是唐克雷蒂 和州长同姓?
Dr. Tancredi... Tancredi like the Governor?

00:48.870 --> 00:50.580
在我们挖掘地道的同时
While we dig on the inside

00:50.810 --> 00:53.230
我们的律师在外面找寻真相
our lawyer searches for the truth on the outside.

00:53.950 --> 00:57.880
我有些情报能还林肯·布伦斯的清白
I have information that will lead to the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.

00:58.110 --> 01:00.980
内部的人声称能够免除林肯的罪刑
Somebody on the inside claims they can exonerate Lincoln.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.990
得让她闭嘴
Someone's been talking.

01:03.190 --> 01:05.750
把任何对我们有威胁的人都清除掉
Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

01:05.980 --> 01:07.800
大家都准备好了 副总统女士
They're ready for you Madam Vice President.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.040
24小时后
24 hours from now

01:16.270 --> 01:18.160
我哥哥将被行刑
my brother is scheduled to die.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.500
但在我看来
But the way I see it

01:19.690 --> 01:22.830
24小时后 我们将逃出这个国家
24 hours from now we'll be out of the country.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.190
就是这了
He's there.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.100
撬不开
It can't be done.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.270
我们出不去了
We're not getting out of here.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.020
真不走运 帅哥
Unfortunately pretty

01:39.210 --> 01:40.850
你没得选择
that ain't an option.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.650
你必须把我们带出去
You are gonna get us out of here.

01:55.330 --> 01:57.530
除非你能用刀弄开那管子
Unless you're gonna use your shank to take out the pipe

01:58.590 --> 01:59.270
拿开
put it away.

01:59.460 --> 02:01.090
不带我们走 就咔嚓了你
I'm gonna put it in your neck you don't get us out of here.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.500
把它拿开 帝博格
Bring it down a peg T-Bag.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.600
闭嘴
Shut your mouth!

02:05.330 --> 02:08.960
记着 帅哥 我是终生监禁
Remember pretty I am serving life plus one.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.030
如果加上个越狱未遂
So if I get busted for attempted escape

02:12.260 --> 02:15.040
再多杀几个人我也无所谓了
I'm gonna throw in a homicide no problem.

02:25.630 --> 02:26.500
你没事吧?
You okay?

02:27.060 --> 02:28.310
又恶心了
Felt sick again.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.010
是啊 你把输液管拔了
Yeah you took your IV's out.

02:30.180 --> 02:32.860
我不想吐在地上 所以我就跑排水沟这来了
Yeah I didn't want to throw up on the floor so I just came to the drain.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.110
忍忍就会好的
Just let me walk this off. I'll be fine.

02:38.370 --> 02:41.550
如果你不输液 就没必要在这里
Lincoln there is no reason for you to be here if your IV isn't in.

02:43.270 --> 02:44.630
一切都好?
Everything all right in here?

02:45.390 --> 02:46.520
很好
It's fine.

02:47.010 --> 02:48.640
他怎么没被拷上?
Why isn't he cuffed to the table?

02:48.840 --> 02:50.390
他能怎么样? 偷棉花球吗?
What's he gonna do steal a cotton ball?

02:52.020 --> 02:53.700
医生 不能让他乱走
Can't have him walking around Doc.You know that.

03:11.570 --> 03:12.480
那是什么?
What was that?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.520
把手伸出来
Put your wrist out.

03:16.270 --> 03:20.770
不要拽 我不会再说第二次
You gonna turn this into something? I'm not gonna say it again.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.470
把手伸出来
Put your wrist out.

04:16.070 --> 04:17.620
嘿 琦夫 过来看看这里怎么回事
Hey Keith come check this out!

04:22.120 --> 04:22.870
琦夫

04:31.060 --> 04:31.980

We got to go.

04:32.430 --> 04:33.380
现在就走
Now.

04:33.570 --> 04:34.480
把绳子给我
Give me the rope.

04:38.590 --> 04:40.140
把绳子给我!
Give me the rope now!

04:44.040 --> 04:44.940
绑住
Tie that off.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.990
我下去了
Okay I'm down.

05:11.690 --> 05:12.860
我们要走了 迈克尔
We gotta go Michael.

05:14.790 --> 05:15.660
走吧
Get down. Let's go.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.590
这本来就是断的 还是谁把它折断了?
Did it break off or did someone break it?

05:33.820 --> 05:34.690
我不知道
I don't know.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.240
这是另一半
Here's the other half.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.690
怎么 光头?
What's up Brad?

06:25.900 --> 06:28.680
嘿 光头 我们去莎奇氏吧 今天是周二半价 一起去喝两杯?
Heading over to Sharkey's.It's two-for Tuesday. Wanna hoist a few?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.800
伙计 我很想
Man I'd love to

06:31.020 --> 06:33.470
但我老婆做晚饭 我说了要回去吃饭的
but my wife is cooking dinner and I told her I'd be home.

06:33.700 --> 06:33.950
差劲
Wuss

06:33.950 --> 06:35.850
还有其他人想去吗?
Anybody else?

06:37.400 --> 06:38.450
自便吧
Suit yourselves.

06:45.150 --> 06:47.650
休息室前的石膏板怎么还没搬?
Ain't none of the Sheetrock in front of the break room been touched.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.520
PI的那帮家伙在等它风干
The PI's are letting it dry out.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.690
还在等?
Still?

07:37.100 --> 07:37.830
韦斯特莫兰德
Westmoreland!

07:38.020 --> 07:39.120
我被绊住了
I'm caught on something.

07:40.740 --> 07:41.800
快呀 快呀
Come on come on come on come on!

07:58.150 --> 07:59.630
不要上来 等一会
Stay there! Stay down there!

08:11.470 --> 08:12.570
为什么锁门?
Why was this door locked?

08:12.800 --> 08:13.860
没锁啊 老大
It wasn't locked boss.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.350
风老是把门吹开
The fan kept pushing it open.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.250
所以我们不得不把门先卡住
So we just had to wedge it closed.

08:22.180 --> 08:24.220
你们就呆在这儿什么都不干?
You've been in here all night not doing a damn thing.

08:24.410 --> 08:26.450
屋子还是湿的 什么都干不了
The room is still wet boss. There's nothing we could do.

08:26.650 --> 08:29.070
我们又不能在这野餐
It's not like we've been having a picnic.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.550
你们这些偷懒不干活的罪犯
Bunch of shiftless no-good convicts.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.770
有什么不满吗 斯科菲尔德?
You got something to say Scofield?

08:43.250 --> 08:47.640
收拾下 你们四个给我滚回牢房里去
Wrap it up.And all four of you get your asses back to the block.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.090
把他们押回牢去
Get these nitwits back to the cell block.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.210
你们好像少了一人
You seem to be one light.

09:21.050 --> 09:22.560
在这呢 老大
Right here boss.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.180
不! 不!
No no. No way!

09:39.300 --> 09:41.680
我本应在见我家人的路上了!
I should be halfway to seeing my family right now.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.180
走吧
Let's go.

09:53.290 --> 09:54.580
马上!
Now!

10:38.490 --> 10:39.550
继续走
Keep it moving. Move it.

10:41.170 --> 10:41.660
走
Go ladies.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.690
他会知道的
Do you think he knows?

10:50.760 --> 10:51.600
林肯?
Lincoln?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.780
我现在采访的是亨利·珀尔 狐狸河监狱的典狱长
I'm here with Henry Pope who is the warden of Fox River Penitentiary

11:04.930 --> 11:09.000
林肯·布伦斯将于明日凌晨0点1分准时行刑
where Lincoln Burrows is scheduled to die by electrocution at 12:01 a.m. Tomorrow.

11:09.270 --> 11:12.130
珀尔狱长 能否告诉我们接下来的几小时有何安排?
Warden Pope can you tell me what's gonna happen in the next few hours?

11:12.320 --> 11:16.400
关于这个 政府部门有严格的标准程序
There are strict Department of Corrections guidelines that govern every aspect of an execution.

11:16.400 --> 11:20.490
会有一定措施确保行刑过程中不会出差错
Measures taken to make sure that the process goes as smoothly as possible.

11:20.690 --> 11:21.520
比如说...
Such as?

11:21.740 --> 11:25.410
狱警会检查刑场 检查观看证人名单
The correctional officers will do a walkthrough we'll review the list of witnesses

11:25.600 --> 11:28.280
电椅会被再三检查确保万无一失
the chair will be checked and rechecked to make sure there's no problem.

11:28.450 --> 11:30.600
至于布伦斯先生你跟他交谈过吗?
And Mr. Burrows himself.Have you spoken with him?

11:30.600 --> 11:32.750
他在生命的终点有什么想法?
What are his thoughts in these final hours?

11:33.960 --> 11:35.900
那是他和上帝之间的事情
I'd say that's between him and his God.

11:36.130 --> 11:36.830
或许还有州长
And maybe the Governor.

11:37.020 --> 11:39.950
据我所知布伦斯的律师们正在请求延期
I understand Burrows' attorneys are going to request a stay.

11:40.180 --> 11:41.580
但愿他们好运
I wish them the best of luck.

11:41.770 --> 11:43.730
这是否表明你相信他是无辜的?
Does that mean you believe he's innocent?

11:43.970 --> 11:46.590
我只相信法律程序
It means I believe in the process

11:46.780 --> 11:51.160
但夺走一个人的生命并不值得高兴
 but I don't relish the prospect of taking another man's life.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.830
不管公正与否
Whether it's just or not 

11:53.020 --> 11:55.380
今天的气氛都很低沉
there's no joy that lies before us today.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.200
感谢狱长先生
Okay thank you very much Warden.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.080
我们晚上继续进行报道
And we will be here with you throughout the night.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.710
并且见证林肯·布伦斯成为
Watching and waiting to see if Lincoln Burrows does in fact become

12:02.940 --> 12:07.430
伊利诺伊州 至1976年以来的第13名死刑犯
only the 13th person to be executed in the state of Illinois since 1976.

12:18.850 --> 12:24.030
如果你心里过意不去 我想告诉你 我并不责怪你
Just so you got one less thing to worry about I want you to know I ain't mad at you.

12:29.670 --> 12:30.580
谢谢
Thank you.

12:33.330 --> 12:34.430
还有多久?
How long until...

12:34.580 --> 12:35.640
16小时
16 hours.

12:37.380 --> 12:38.850
律师有什么进展?
Are his lawyers making any progress?

12:39.080 --> 12:41.240
还有机会吗? 没有
Is there still a chance with that? No.

12:41.610 --> 12:44.180
只有一个人能终止行刑
There's only one person who can really stop this execution.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.350
我要见我哥哥
I need to see my brother.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.950
只是聊聊 5分钟就行
Just to talk.For five minutes.

13:26.270 --> 13:28.270
好 好的 我试试看
Yeah. Yeah. I'll try.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.390
嗯...
OK...

13:55.720 --> 13:56.440
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

13:56.630 --> 14:00.100
他说你只能等到待临终告别时才能见
I'm told that you have to wait until final visitation.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.490
你会向你父亲求情吗? 为了我?
Would you talk to your father for me

14:02.680 --> 14:03.510
求你
please?

14:07.590 --> 14:10.200
相信我 我父亲知道我对死刑的立场
Believe me my father knows where I stand on the death penalty

14:10.360 --> 14:11.960
我很清楚地表示过
nd I'm just as clear on his...

14:12.130 --> 14:14.810
莎拉...对不起 唐克雷蒂医生
Sara... Dr. Tancredi I'm sorry.

14:16.930 --> 14:18.980
这不是关于死刑的道德争论
This isn't about the morality of the death penalty.

14:19.170 --> 14:19.880
这是
This is...

14:21.320 --> 14:23.800
是杀死一个无辜的人
This is about killing an innocent man 

14:24.180 --> 14:25.090
我哥哥
my brother

14:25.690 --> 14:28.240
我相信你父亲能帮我
and surely your father can't be in favor of that.

14:28.430 --> 14:29.390
让他和林肯的律师谈谈
Just talk to Lincoln's attorneys

14:29.610 --> 14:30.420
就一个小时
just for an hour

14:30.610 --> 14:32.760
我发誓他会相信的
and I swear to God you'll be convinced of his innocence.

14:33.900 --> 14:34.660
迈克尔
Michael

14:35.950 --> 14:37.970
如果我能改变现状
I would pick up the phone right now if I thought

14:37.970 --> 14:39.990
我会毫不迟疑地拿起电话
there was any chance that I could make a difference

14:40.180 --> 14:41.620
你要明白
but you have to understand

14:42.750 --> 14:45.660
我所做的一切他都不喜欢
I'm the last person in the world that my father listens to

14:45.960 --> 14:48.600
他讨厌我的工作 讨厌我的信念
He hates what I do he hates what I believe in.

14:48.870 --> 14:51.200
我向他请求特赦你哥哥
And if I'm the one asking for clemency for your brother 

14:51.580 --> 14:53.160
不可能成功
your brother won't get it.

15:07.370 --> 15:08.090
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.590
如果特伦斯·斯蒂德曼还活着 
Look if Terrence Steadman is still alive then it

15:22.590 --> 15:24.480
埋在墓里的就不可能是他
can't be Terrence Steadman buried in the ground.

15:24.670 --> 15:27.960
我总不能或一个告密者声称斯蒂德曼还活着 我们就应该...
Yeah but a secret informant claims that Steadman is still alive?

15:28.150 --> 15:30.000
在我看来 尼克 这很牵强
I don't know Nick.It all sounds pretty far-fetched.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.160
你是法官的文书 帮我们加进诉讼事件表就好了
You're his clerk just get us on the docket.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.870
你这是要断送他的政治前途
Nick you're asking him to commit political suicide

15:35.020 --> 15:38.740
这可是伊利诺伊最恶劣的死刑犯
by granting a stay of execution to Illinois' most notorious death row inmate

15:38.930 --> 15:41.230
我们只要求开棺许可
Officially all we're asking is for an exhumation order.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.810
如果他批准的话 他可以让死刑拖延一下直到验尸有个结果!
If he grants it he can order a stay until the tests come in.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.460
开棺许可?
An exhumation order?

15:45.650 --> 15:48.360
这下更好 去挖副总统弟弟的坟
Oh well that's better. Digging up the Vice President's brother.

15:48.590 --> 15:49.340
没门
No way.

15:49.630 --> 15:52.290
不不 我们过去关系不错
Lyle Lyle look we took Intro to Civ Pro together remember?

15:52.510 --> 15:55.190
我们住在纽约的破公寓 为了执照日夜不分的研究案例
We studied for the Bar day and night in that crappy little apartment of yours

15:55.380 --> 15:56.440
发誓要改变世界
talking about how we were going to make a difference.

15:56.630 --> 15:59.200
尼克 你提出的动议11小时内有效
Nick you filed an 11th-hour motion

15:59.390 --> 16:01.290
柯尔斯法官下午的时间是满的
and Judge Kessler's docket is full this afternoon.

16:01.470 --> 16:03.320
得了莱尔 我知道法庭听你安排
Come on Lyle everyone knows you run that courtroom.

16:03.890 --> 16:05.630
不能稍微调整一下?
You can't adjust things around a bit?

16:06.320 --> 16:08.900
告密者昨天被杀了 我在场
The informant that was killed yesterday I was there.

16:09.660 --> 16:13.830
我敢说 这些人为了陷害林肯可以不择手段
I know firsthand these people will do whatever they can to frame Lincoln for Steadman's murder.

16:16.340 --> 16:18.490
我们只要求能陈述我们发现的疑点
All we're asking is to be heard.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.680
下午我给你们15分钟
I'll give you 15 minutes this afternoon that's it.

16:24.830 --> 16:25.630
谢谢
Thank you.

16:25.780 --> 16:26.760
谢谢 别客气
Thank you. Yeah you're welcome.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.840
他还不知道发生了什么
He doesn't even know what happened.

16:40.420 --> 16:41.630
他知道你尽力了
He knows you tried

16:41.970 --> 16:42.800
你这么认为?
Do you think so?

16:43.030 --> 16:44.430
他是你哥哥 他了解你
He's your brother. He knows you.

16:44.770 --> 16:45.940
所以...是的
So yes.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.360
我答应过他 救他出去
I promised I would get him out of here

16:49.080 --> 16:50.700
你向很多人保证过 帅哥
You promised a lot of people pretty.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.220
走开点 好吧?
Enough man all right

16:52.410 --> 16:54.040
不关你事 小子
This don't concern you boy.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.730
你让别人的希望落空了
You don't get a man's hopes up like that and then just...

16:57.920 --> 17:00.530
滚开 否则我揍扁你这变态的
Back up or I'll beat your skinny ass into the ground.

17:01.060 --> 17:02.920
一点也不难
And it wouldn't take much to do it.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.830
好了各位 放风结束 回牢房里去
All right ladies rec time is over. Back on the block!

17:09.020 --> 17:11.060
你欠我一张出去的票 帅哥
You owe me a ticket out of here pretty.

17:13.590 --> 17:15.140
我会来收的
And I will collect.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.470
对你哥哥的事我很遗憾
I'm really sorry about your brother.

17:25.650 --> 17:26.590
谢谢
Thanks.

17:27.160 --> 17:30.370
我知道你也指望这次 所以...
Look I know you were counting on this so...

17:30.560 --> 17:32.220
我的问题留给我自己担心吧
Let me worry about my problems.

17:32.410 --> 17:34.380
你承担的已经够多了
'Cause I know you've got enough on your mind right now.

17:35.250 --> 17:38.020
可更糟糕的是 就我所知的这些年来
For what it's worth over the years 

17:38.290 --> 17:40.340
那些即将面对电椅的人
I've known a few men who've sat on that chair

17:40.660 --> 17:44.720
随着日子的临近 都深受折磨 所做的只是祈祷那一天快些到来
and as the day gets near all you can really do is pray it goes quick.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.820
大概10年前 有个人
Once about 10 years ago 

17:48.010 --> 17:51.490
没能电死 因为保险丝熔断了
there was a man caught a few sparks not enough to do the job.

17:51.950 --> 17:55.320
要等3个星期 重新制定程序
Had to wait another three weeks while they reset the whole process.

17:56.830 --> 17:57.890
听起来很不可思议
And it may sound crazy 

17:58.040 --> 18:00.540
他说这是他生命中最难受的3个星期
but he said it was the worst three weeks of his life

18:00.730 --> 18:03.900
折磨他的不是电流 是等待
because it's not the lightning that kills you it's the wait.

18:04.860 --> 18:08.290
静下心来 让你哥哥的等待早日结束吧
So take solace in the fact that your brother's wait is over.

18:08.450 --> 18:10.380
这么说 如果电椅出问题
So if something happens to the chair 

18:12.040 --> 18:13.440
他的死刑要延迟三个星期
he's got three more weeks?

18:13.630 --> 18:15.820
杀死一个人需要很多手续
There's a lot of protocol in killing a man.

18:16.460 --> 18:19.080
新的死刑令 一份死亡通知书
A new death warrant another medical clearance.

18:19.270 --> 18:21.080
三个星期可以发生很多事情
A lot can happen in three weeks.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.370
聊什么呢?
Yo what scrapes yo?

18:23.920 --> 18:24.830
谢谢
Thanks.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.360
在谈什么?没什么
What y'all talking about?Nothing.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.610
跟紧 走 跟紧
Keep it together.Go keep it together!

18:42.370 --> 18:43.280
我要进去
I'm going in.

18:45.430 --> 18:46.950
现在可是大白天
It's daytime.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.450
好吧 我会挡着的
I'll hang a sheet.

19:24.390 --> 19:25.970
有什么要问的? 关于...
Do you have any questions about...

19:27.410 --> 19:28.920
今晚会发生什么?
what's gonna happen tonight?

19:30.050 --> 19:33.950
要吃饭 还要走走
When I get to eat when I'm supposed to walk 

19:34.250 --> 19:36.220
还要坐上去试试松紧
how it's gonna feel when they tighten the belts.

19:36.410 --> 19:38.010
你觉得这有用么?
Any of that gonna help come midnight?

19:39.410 --> 19:41.240
有些事最好有点思想准备
Some feel it's best to be prepared.

19:42.790 --> 19:43.880
迈克尔怎么样?
How's Michael?

19:44.370 --> 19:45.920
着急的想见你
He's anxious to see you.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.910
但是他们不允许 只能等最后探访
Unfortunately we've been told that that's not possible until final visitation.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.670
你以前经历过这些吗?
You've been through this before?

19:57.440 --> 19:58.350
从来没有
No.

19:59.730 --> 20:04.050
只是医生必须在场的 所以...
Just so you know a doctor needs to be present so 

20:04.460 --> 20:06.480
我想我整晚都在这里
for what it's worth I'll be there tonight.

20:07.050 --> 20:09.500
-能求你点事吗?  -当然 什么事?
-Can I ask a favor? -Yeah. What?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.220
我死了以后 你...
When I'm gone can you

20:13.940 --> 20:16.170
你能帮我照顾我弟弟吗?
look out for my brother?

20:53.280 --> 20:54.830
你进里面去干什么?
What were you doing back there?

21:02.920 --> 21:04.350
这样还不错吧?
So you like doing that too?

21:04.540 --> 21:06.620
把薯条蘸进去 当然喜欢
Dipping a fry in the shake? Hells yeah

21:07.650 --> 21:09.290
不错 不错
Good times. Good times.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.970
那么...里面有什么情况?
So what's going on out there?

21:13.390 --> 21:15.810
没什么 我自己尽量少惹麻烦就行了
Nothing you know just staying out of trouble.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.040
我是说有没有什么内部消息
I meant in terms of any office gossip you might have for me.

21:22.350 --> 21:29.080
倒是有个傻子想偷东西 我帮你留意
Yo check it.This one fool has been trying to cop a joint.So I'll keep ear-hustling for that.

21:31.130 --> 21:34.570
你本应该盯着斯科菲尔德 然后把消息反馈给我
We had an agreement. You were supposed to bird-dog Scofield and get back to me.

21:34.840 --> 21:39.150
我一直都是这么做的 伙计 我很努力了相信我 我什么都没得到
I been trying man I've been working the corners. Trust me. I ain't got nothing.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.460
我看到你在院子里跟他和那个糟老头谈话
I seen you talking to him in the yard him and the geezer.

21:41.650 --> 21:44.600
我是跟他说了话 但他什么也没跟我说啊
Yeah I talked to Scofield but he ain't told me nothing.

21:44.790 --> 21:47.570
这些汉堡和薯条要100块
Then it's 100 bucks for the burger and fries.

21:47.990 --> 21:49.610
头 你知道我没钱
Boss you know I ain't got no money.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.640
你最好不要变得这么蠢 这次轮班结束 你必须付这100块钱
Then you better start selling your ass.100 bucks by the end of the shift

21:53.640 --> 21:57.060
否则 你就等着看谁做你的新狱友吧
or there's gonna be a bidding war to see who gets you as their new cellie.

21:57.060 --> 21:58.220
滚吧
Beat it.

22:13.340 --> 22:15.720
今天放风后
In the yard today 

22:15.950 --> 22:18.030
我是听到斯科菲尔德说了些什么...
I did hear Scofield say something.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.340
他说电椅有什么问题
He said if something goes wrong with the chair 

22:25.360 --> 22:27.630
他哥哥就还能活3周
his brother gets three more weeks to live.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.260
我们算扯清了 滚吧
We're square. Get out of here.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.070
准备的怎么样了?
How's it going in here?

22:58.280 --> 22:59.220
一切就绪
Ready for liftoff.

22:59.410 --> 23:00.100
椅子运行正常?
Chair is working?

23:00.290 --> 23:00.940
是啊 怎么了?
Yeah. Why?

23:01.090 --> 23:01.900
再测试一次
Run a test.

23:02.100 --> 23:05.800
今早已经做过测试 负责人已经签字了
I already did. The electrical contractor signed off on the diagnostic this morning

23:05.990 --> 23:08.580
-我要再测试一次  -为什么?
-We're good to go run it again. -Why?

23:08.880 --> 23:09.940
照做就是了
Run it.

23:18.650 --> 23:20.120
启动不起来
It ain't working.

23:21.370 --> 23:22.720
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

23:23.060 --> 23:24.910
我不知道这是怎么回事
I don't know what could've happened.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.240
你哥要等手续办好才能死
So once they redo all the paperwork your brother gets three more weeks.

23:34.430 --> 23:35.420
是的
Right.

23:35.980 --> 23:38.290
-那我们有时间了咯?  -没多少
-So we got time then.  -Not a lot. But some.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.760
还是从医务室上出去? 
Are we still going through the infirmary?

23:40.760 --> 23:43.000
再弄管道他们会察觉的
If I corrode that pipe again they'll know something's up.

23:43.620 --> 23:47.440
-你还有其它办法吗?  -先过了今天再说吧
-You got another way?  -Right now I'm just worried about getting through tonight.

24:04.920 --> 24:07.090
小心点 两千伏的高压呢
Careful. There's 2 000 volts running through that thing.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.070
天哪
Oh God.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.710
我要见我弟弟
I want to see my brother.

24:45.970 --> 24:47.860
等到最后一次探访吧
When we move you to final visitation.

24:48.050 --> 24:48.960
要到什么时候?
When's that?

24:49.110 --> 24:51.000
等做完这个以后
Right after we do this.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.570
等一下...
Just...

24:56.650 --> 24:58.780
这是你的最后一天了 林肯
It's your last day Linc.

24:58.950 --> 25:02.580
你可以不带手铐 但是...
I'd prefer to keep you out of cuffs as much as possible but

25:03.530 --> 25:05.350
但我需要一些保证
I need some assurances.

25:07.410 --> 25:12.230
你一直对我不错 我不会惹麻烦的
You've always been straight up with me Stolte.You have my word.

25:21.760 --> 25:25.040
法官大人 林肯先生的案子就是一个阴谋
Your Honor from the outset Mr. Burrows' case has been tainted

25:25.040 --> 25:27.580
证据被毁 真相被扭曲 
by conspiracy characterized by destruction of evidence

25:27.580 --> 25:30.130
目击证人受到威胁
distortion of the truth and witness intimidation.

25:30.320 --> 25:30.970
法官大人 我再一次反对
Again Judge I have to object.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.840
这些指控
These are some serious accusations

25:33.030 --> 25:34.430
根本毫无证据
with absolutely no proof.

25:34.590 --> 25:36.960
没证据? 这20分钟我都在争些什么?
No proof? What have I been arguing for the past 20 minutes?

25:37.150 --> 25:38.130
你说呢
You got me.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.930
法官大人特琪先生大概没理解我们的陈述
Judge Kessler Mr. Tucci might not appreciate the weight of what we've just presented 

25:42.120 --> 25:43.330
但相信请您一定充分理解了
but surely you must.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.390
正如多诺万小姐所说
but surely you must.

25:45.700 --> 25:48.920
一位顶尖视频专家
a top video forensic analyst has disputed the authenticity of a

25:48.920 --> 25:52.140
对林肯·布伦斯案关键证据的真实性表示怀疑
surveillance tape that was the key piece of evidence in convicting Lincoln Burrows.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.100
你说的是那盘已经不存在了的录像带?
That's the tape that no longer exists right?

25:54.250 --> 25:56.070
那是因为你的委托人销毁了录像带
Because your client had it destroyed.

25:56.260 --> 25:58.430
你完全搞错了
Unless my client is a rusted water pipe in the County Records Office

25:58.430 --> 26:00.600
存放资料的档案室里是根生锈的水管
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

26:00.900 --> 26:05.230
法官 多诺万小姐的公寓的突然爆炸 是为了封住我们的嘴
Judge Miss Donovan's apartment was blown up in an attempt to silence both her and me.

26:05.460 --> 26:08.570
这只是和案件没有关系的瓦斯泄漏事件 法官大人
That was independently corroborated as a gas leak Your Honor.

26:08.760 --> 26:12.890
法官大人 一个月前 一个名叫 保罗·凯勒曼的特工来过我的办公室
 Judge a month ago a Secret Service agent named Paul Kellerman visited my office.

26:13.160 --> 26:17.200
我看见他在昨晚枪杀了另一名特工 丹尼尔·哈尔
I saw Kellerman last night when he shot and killed another agent Daniel Hale

26:17.390 --> 26:20.830
就在当晚他告诉我 副总统弟弟依然还活着
right after Hale told me that Terrence Steadman was alive and well.

26:21.020 --> 26:23.750
法官大人
Your Honor I'm presenting to the clerk an affidavit

26:23.750 --> 26:26.490
我这里有证据可以证实
from the director of the Secret Service Agency.

26:26.680 --> 26:30.350
特工部门从来就没有过
It states that at no time has there ever been an agent

26:30.350 --> 26:34.030
保罗·凯勒曼和丹尼尔·哈尔的这两个人
of that organization by the name of Paul Kellerman or Daniel Hale.

26:34.230 --> 26:36.950
另外关于此次枪击没有其他的证人
In addition there were no other witnesses to this shooting.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.690
没有在现场发现弹头
No bullets were found 

26:38.890 --> 26:40.660
没有血迹 没有弹壳
no blood no shell casings.

26:40.850 --> 26:45.150
这次所谓暗杀的唯一目击者只有多诺万小姐一人
The only witness to this alleged murder is Veronica Donovan 

26:45.340 --> 26:47.490
同时她也是林肯的前女友
Lincoln Burrows' ex-girlfriend.

26:47.750 --> 26:50.050
法官大人 我对多诺万小姐的遭遇感到很抱歉
Now Your Honor I feel for Miss Donovan.

26:50.210 --> 26:50.770
你省省吧
Save it.

26:50.930 --> 26:54.860
我是真心的 但绝望会让人做出极端的行为
I do.But desperation causes desperate acts.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.160
那就是我们今天所见到的 法官大人
And that's what we're seeing here today Your Honor.

26:57.470 --> 27:00.570
我的委托人...美利坚合众国的副总统
My client the Vice-President of the United States..

27:00.720 --> 27:01.510
法官大人...
Judge Kessler.

27:03.420 --> 27:07.510
你们两个是否有确凿的证据?
Do either of you have any evidence that is admissible?

27:07.700 --> 27:09.170
哪怕切实一点也好啊
Even just tangible?

27:09.360 --> 27:10.990
你们的陈词确实够吓人
Your claims if true are terrifying.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.390
但是所有能证明的人...
But anything or anyone that could verify your story

27:13.550 --> 27:16.120
不是失踪了就是死了
is either gone missing or dead.

27:20.250 --> 27:22.730
我知道时间很紧迫
I know time is of the essence.

27:25.010 --> 27:27.110
我会考虑你们的陈词
I'll reserve judgment for now. I'll take your arguments into consideration 

27:27.720 --> 27:30.460
几小时后再作出判决
and I'll have a decision within a few hours.

27:36.250 --> 27:40.300
这些小杂种不是一般的讨厌
These little bastards are the bane of my existence I swear to God.

27:40.940 --> 27:41.840
经常有这种事?
You get this a lot?

27:42.000 --> 27:46.050
是啊 热的地方会吸引他们去取暖 它们的脊椎可以收缩
Yeah they're attracted to the heat when they're cold 

27:46.200 --> 27:48.090
如果必要的话 它们能钻进很小的缝隙
plus they got collapsible vertebrae or some deal so they can squeeze through a crack yea big if they're determined.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.360
咬了一下电线就短路了?
And he shorted out the wire just by biting on it?

27:50.620 --> 27:54.120
光是咬电线不会 一旦尾巴碰到金属
Not by chewing on the wire alone but if the tail touches metal 

27:54.500 --> 27:59.480
就等于接上了地 保险丝就这么烧断了 老鼠也玩完了
it acts as a ground and boom fuse pops.Along with the rat.

27:59.710 --> 28:00.600
妈的!
I'll be damned.

28:00.830 --> 28:02.430
你能换保险丝吗?
So can you change the fuse?

28:02.660 --> 28:04.130
是的 箱子里还有一根
Yeah there's another one right here in the box.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.490
现在就干不行吗?
Can you do it now?

28:05.660 --> 28:08.260
得等到通报政府和填写完文件以后
Right after I notify the state and fill out the paperwork.

28:08.530 --> 28:12.100
等..等一下伙计 你们两个
Now hold up a minute.Both of you.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.000
我可不会给你很多时间
We're gonna give more time to a guy

28:15.150 --> 28:17.570
那家伙杀了副总统的弟弟
who killed the Vice President's brother?

28:18.890 --> 28:20.520
他是个恐怖分子
This guy's a terrorist.

28:21.310 --> 28:23.040
撇开丢饭碗不说
Forget about losing our jobs 

28:23.270 --> 28:24.530
我们可能还会被指控的
we could all face charges.

28:24.690 --> 28:26.140
这里只有我们三个...
Only the three of us know.

28:27.420 --> 28:29.240
就这么放着不大好吧
Real easy to keep it that way.

28:37.730 --> 28:39.510
你们说吧
It's your guys' call.

28:45.740 --> 28:47.080
还有多少时间
How much longer?

28:47.310 --> 28:48.520
六小时
Six hours.

28:48.710 --> 28:50.030
40号 开门
Open on 40!

28:54.910 --> 28:57.610
斯科菲尔德 走了
Scofield your brother's gonna be

28:57.610 --> 29:00.320
你哥哥的最后一次探访
transported to final visitation soon.You can meet him there.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.720
你看上去很惊讶啊
You look surprised.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.150
你应该知道是今天行刑的
You knew it was scheduled today.

29:13.840 --> 29:14.860
不...
No I...

29:23.060 --> 29:24.690
有什么要说的?
You were saying?

29:57.570 --> 30:00.860
