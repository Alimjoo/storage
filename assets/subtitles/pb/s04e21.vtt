00:01.240 --> 00:02.980
《越狱》  前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

00:02.990 --> 00:04.610
我把 信寄给你
When I sent you the envelopes

00:04.620 --> 00:05.830
可不是闹着玩的
I wasn't just playing games.

00:05.840 --> 00:09.110
靠近4号目标
Move on subject 4

00:09.120 --> 00:09.930
执行命令
Execute the order.

00:09.940 --> 00:11.780
求你不要这样做
Please don't do that.

00:17.540 --> 00:20.070
你想要参与到这次行动中  现在机会来了
You wanted to get in on the action, here's your chance.

00:24.420 --> 00:29.370
7.5亿美元的已经汇到卢森堡的一个帐户上了
3/4 of a billion dollars in a numerical account in Luxembourg.

00:29.570 --> 00:32.260
所有数据将会在24小时内传输完毕
All the data will be delivered within 24 hours.

00:32.530 --> 00:33.960
箱子给我
Case.

00:33.980 --> 00:35.790
我来拿
I'll take that.

00:35.810 --> 00:37.870
老妈  你好啊
Hi, mom.

00:38.050 --> 00:40.210
我知道锡拉在你手上  把锡拉给我
I know you have it. Bring me scylla.

00:40.220 --> 00:43.000
否则这次莎拉就真得死了
Or this time sara's death will not be faked.

00:44.690 --> 00:47.350
看来你要做出抉择了
Looks like you have a little decision to make.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.000
锡拉  还是你爱的人
Scylla -- or someone you Love.

00:56.970 --> 00:58.590
好好考虑考虑  迈克
Just think this through, michael.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.110
我考虑过了  两个人我们都要救
I have, and we're saving them both.

01:01.130 --> 01:02.140
你怎么救?
How?

01:02.150 --> 01:04.080
我会想出来的
I'll figure it out.

01:04.090 --> 01:05.640
你哥哥快要失血过多而死了
Your brother is bleeding to death.

01:05.650 --> 01:07.950
我想知道能不能把林肯和莎拉集中到一个地方
I wonder if we can bring lincoln and sara to the same place.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.280
现在你唯一的优势就是两方都不知道
Right now your only advantage is that neither party knows

01:11.300 --> 01:13.780
还有另一方手握你的人质
That there's another player that has leverage on you.

01:13.790 --> 01:14.820
如果你把两人了集中到一起
You bring them both together

01:14.830 --> 01:16.170
你就失去了战术优势
You'll lose your tactical edge.

01:16.190 --> 01:17.490
我不会丢下莎拉的
I am not abandoning sara

01:17.500 --> 01:18.510
我没让你那么做
I didn't say to do that

01:18.520 --> 01:19.440
我的意思是...
What I am say is...

01:19.450 --> 01:22.100
莎拉有没有中弹这个优势
sara has the advantage of not having a bullet in her chest.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.980
一个一个来
One at a time.

01:31.420 --> 01:33.550
令人吃惊
Big surprise.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.530
蠢的那个被捉住了  聪明的那个逃跑了
The dumb one got caught, the smart one got away.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.210
我都能总结出规律了
I'm beginning to see a pattern here.

01:39.220 --> 01:41.050
他不会给你的
He's never going to give it to you.

01:41.770 --> 01:45.950
我不这么认为  他真的很关心你
I disagree. He truly cares for you.

01:46.010 --> 01:49.470
虽然事实证明你并不值得
No matter how many times you've shown you don't deserve it.

01:49.630 --> 01:51.740
你们两个真是
You know, you two are truly

01:51.750 --> 01:54.170
先天和后天因素影响的经典案例
A classic study nature versus nurture.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.540
同样的环境  同样的父母
Same environment, same parents

01:57.550 --> 02:00.640
你们却完全不同
You're completely different.

02:00.650 --> 02:03.080
你觉得是为什么呢  林肯
Why do you think that is, lincolnoln?

02:03.090 --> 02:06.050
因为他们的妈妈是个疯婆子
Because mom's a psychotic bitch.

02:11.350 --> 02:12.700
你好啊  迈克
Hello, michael.

02:12.710 --> 02:14.870
好吧  你赢了  我把锡拉给你
All right, you win. I'll give you scylla.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.730
林肯需要什么就给他什么
Just give lincoln whatever he needs.

02:16.740 --> 02:18.620
我还没得到我需要的东西呢
Not until I get what I need.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.340
爱迪生装箱区B码头
Edison shipping yard, B dock,

02:21.350 --> 02:22.900
45分钟内到达 带上我哥哥
45 minutes.and bring my brother

02:22.910 --> 02:26.780
45分钟?  近一点
45 minutes? Cutting it close.

02:26.790 --> 02:28.280
他看起来可不太妙
He doesn't look so good.

02:28.290 --> 02:30.350
到那儿就是了
Just be there.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.240
你觉得值吗  莎拉
Is it worth it, sara?

02:34.210 --> 02:36.320
你有没有回想过那个晚上
You ever go back to that night

02:36.330 --> 02:38.750
想过如果你当时
And wonder how things would have gone

02:39.310 --> 02:44.490
锁了医务室的门  事情会变成怎样
If you had just left that infirmary door locked?

02:45.430 --> 02:47.090
那些人的本来可以活下来的
All the people whose lives would have been saved.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.480
你爸爸也是
Hell, your father would still be alive.

02:50.490 --> 02:52.500
你有没有想到过这一点
You ever think about that?

02:53.720 --> 02:55.840
现在既然迈克要把锡拉还给我了
And now that michael's returning scylla to me

02:55.850 --> 02:58.280
你们这一切就白忙活了
It was all for nothing.

02:59.190 --> 03:02.000
如果他真还给你了
Assuming he does return it.

03:02.010 --> 03:05.630
如果情况相反  如果是迈克被抓了
If the situation were reversed, if michaelwere here

03:05.780 --> 03:07.640
你手上有锡拉
And you were holding scylla,

03:07.650 --> 03:10.170
你会怎么做
What would you do?

03:10.620 --> 03:12.680
你会把锡拉带来的
You'd bring it back

03:12.690 --> 03:14.990
和你没锁门是一个原因
For the same reason you left that door unlocked.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.960
因为你不能眼睁睁看着无辜的人死掉
Because you couldn't let an innocent man die.

03:18.930 --> 03:21.530
你的情感左右了你的理性判断
Your heart betrays your better judgment.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.410
斯科菲尔德也是这样
So does scofield's.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.070
你猜的没错
You know, you're probably right.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.590
因为迈克从你鼻子底下把锡拉拿走的那天晚上
Because if michaelused his better judgment the night he

03:28.600 --> 03:31.050
他如果理性判断的话
Stoll scylla out from under your nose

03:31.750 --> 03:33.190
就会把你杀了
He would have killed you.

03:35.870 --> 03:38.160
不要让我看见她
Get her out of my sight.

03:50.770 --> 03:52.960
牵着
Take it.

04:00.900 --> 04:05.630
要么你牵着我的口袋  要么我就牵你的
Either take my pocket or I take yours.

04:07.450 --> 04:08.780
明白么
Understand?

04:08.790 --> 04:10.360
当局正在街上进行地毯式搜查
The authorities are blanketing the streets

04:10.370 --> 04:12.250
以搜寻主要嫌疑人
Looking for the primary suspects

04:12.680 --> 04:15.240
林肯·布伦斯和迈克斯科菲尔德
lincoln·Burrows and michaelscofield.

04:15.260 --> 04:16.870
因近几年来发生的
The brothers famous for

04:16.880 --> 04:18.810
最胆大妄为的越狱行为而出名的
One of the most daring prison breaks in recent history

04:18.920 --> 04:22.240
这对兄弟携有枪支并且极度危险
Are considered armed and extremely dangerous.

04:27.490 --> 04:28.840
自制炸弹
Homemade explosives?

04:28.850 --> 04:30.340
你有更好的主意吗
You got a better idea?

04:30.350 --> 04:34.800
也许救你哥  救所有人  最好的方法是
Maybe the best way to save lincoln, to save everyone

04:35.130 --> 04:38.100
给克里斯蒂娜她所想要的东西
Is to give christina what she wants.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.500
我只是想找出一个保证我们挚爱的人
I am just trying to find a way where the people that we love

04:40.510 --> 04:41.780
的安全的方法
don't end up in a autopsy table.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.230
我不会让这件事发生的
And I am not.

04:44.530 --> 04:46.970
你没弄错吧  阿历克斯
Better get your story straight, Alex.

04:46.980 --> 04:48.240
你一直在说服我
This whole time you've been saying

04:48.250 --> 04:49.730
把锡拉还给将军
You should give scylla back to the general.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.310
你没听见他对赛尔夫的妻子做了什么吗
Didn't you hear what he did to self's wife?

04:51.320 --> 04:52.580
赛尔夫自己自作自受
self made his own bed.

04:52.590 --> 04:54.290
对  我们要收拾他的烂摊子
Yeah, we're sleeping with in it.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.880
让我们想想  最好的结局
Let's say best case scenario.

04:58.650 --> 05:01.120
我们也许能找到林肯和莎拉
Maybe somehow we're able to get to lincoln and sara.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.480
然后呢
Okay. What then?

05:02.490 --> 05:05.190
将军还派人监视着我的妻子
General've still got somebody watching my wife.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.870
要怎么样保证她的安全?
What's the plan to keep her safe?

05:06.880 --> 05:08.990
L.J呢?  又要怎么样保证他的安全?
What about L.J? What's the plan to keep him safe?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.400
我现在考虑不到那么多
I can't thingk about that right now.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.250
也许我们应该找你妈谈个条件
Maybe we go to your mother and try to make a deal.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.600
她和将军是死对头了
I mean, there's no love lost with her and the general.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.860
如果我们给她锡拉
With her contracts, if we give her scylla

05:16.870 --> 05:19.300
有她的关系网络也许她能找到...
Maybe she can find out where the agents...

05:19.310 --> 05:21.110
我们不会要调查  我们不会把锡拉还回去的
We're not finding out and not giving it back.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.640
我们会救出所有人
We're going to save everyone.

06:13.630 --> 06:15.600
你怎么会在这儿
What the hell are you doing here?

06:15.660 --> 06:18.450
我怎么会在这儿
What am I doing here?

06:18.550 --> 06:20.630
你在这儿康复  赛尔夫先生
You're in recovery, Mr. self.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.460
看来你摔得不轻
Apparently you had quite a fall.

06:22.470 --> 06:24.810
幸运的是有人发现了你并且报了警
Luckily someone found you and called 9-1-1.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.400
他们做什么了
They did what?

06:26.410 --> 06:28.570
医生马上就到  来查看你的历史记录
The doctor will be in shortly to go over your history.

06:28.580 --> 06:29.480
不要  不要
No, no.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.460
叫医生去给下一个人看病
Tell the doctor to go see the next guy.

06:32.470 --> 06:33.910
我就走了
I'm going.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.860
事实上  我不能让你走
Actually, I can't.

06:35.870 --> 06:37.460
有人等着要和你谈话
There's men here waiting to talk to you.

06:37.470 --> 06:39.000
什么样的人
What kind of men?

06:39.010 --> 06:41.200
戴徽章的那种人
The kind with badges.

06:41.630 --> 06:43.470
赛尔夫先生  我是克里斯·弗兰克探员
Mr. self, my name is Agent Chris Franco.

06:43.890 --> 06:46.270
我们是FBI的
We're with the bureau.

06:46.330 --> 06:48.170
我们想问你一些问题
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

06:48.410 --> 06:49.580
什么问题
About what?

06:49.590 --> 06:51.190
告诉我林肯·布伦斯
Start with where we can find lincoln·Burrows

06:51.200 --> 06:53.110
和迈克斯科菲尔德在哪里
And michaelscofield.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.760
准备好接我们
Be ready to pick us up.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.230
爆炸的时候最好别离它太近
Better not get too close to that thing when it goes off.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.170
你最好别走远
You'd better not get too far.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.780
好吧
All right.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.630
如果迈克有任何举动  就把他两个膝盖都打碎
If michaeltries anything, take out both knees.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.550
我可不想让他死
I don't want him dead

07:35.560 --> 07:37.780
只想让他动不了向我求饶
I just want him immobilized and eager to talk.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.090
布伦斯怎么处理
And what do you want to do with burrows?

07:41.820 --> 07:45.910
锡拉一到手  就把他丢到海里去
Once I get scylla, dump him off the dock.

07:46.880 --> 07:50.660
喂  新闻里说的人
Yeah, one of the guys from the news.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.140
我想我刚刚看见其中一个
I think i just seen him.

07:54.690 --> 07:56.980
有趣的选择
Interesting choice.

07:57.290 --> 07:59.440
我以为你会选择人多的地方
I would have thought you'd picked something a little more

07:59.730 --> 08:01.680
好保护自己
Public for your own protection.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.660
公共场所现在不利于我的安全
Something a little more public isn't safe for me right now.

08:04.670 --> 08:06.200
拜你所赐
Thanks to you.

08:07.430 --> 08:08.870
你一个人来的吗
Did you come alone?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.400
你呢
Did you?

08:12.770 --> 08:14.300
拜托
Come on.

08:14.310 --> 08:18.670
我们至少能有一次不互相欺骗  对不对
We can have at least one honest conversation, can't we?

08:18.980 --> 08:21.490
事实上  我想诚实
Actually, I'd like that.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.080
不管你是怎么想的
In spite of what you think

08:23.090 --> 08:24.710
我从未想要让你受伤
I never wanted to see you get hurt.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.000
你想要什么
What did you want?

08:27.020 --> 08:30.750
理解  原谅
Understanding, forgiveness.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.190
我做出了自己的选择
I made my choice

08:33.200 --> 08:35.120
我早知道我不会得到那些了
I knew I'd never have any of those things.

08:35.130 --> 08:37.700
但你会拥有权利  不是吗
But you'll have power, won't you?

08:37.710 --> 08:40.500
对  而你会拥有林肯
Yes, and you'll have lincolnoln.

08:40.510 --> 08:43.130
老实说我觉得你非常不值
Honestly you're getting the short end of the stick.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.640
说到林肯
Speaking of which

08:44.650 --> 08:46.380
我要把他送去医院  他在哪儿
I need to get him to a hospital so where is he?

08:46.390 --> 08:47.470
锡拉在哪儿
Where's scylla?

08:47.480 --> 08:50.940
我要确信他还活着
I need to know he's alive.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.640
满意了吧
Satisfied?

09:03.240 --> 09:05.480
跟我来
Follow me.

09:07.950 --> 09:11.460
现在  你不会耍什么鬼把戏的
Now, you wouldn't have some little trick up your sleeve,

09:11.480 --> 09:12.740
是不是  儿子
Would you, son?

09:12.750 --> 09:15.530
我不想再和你玩了
I'm done playing games with you.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.680
很好
Good.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.370
那把锡拉拿出来给我看
Then bring scylla out to me.

09:21.380 --> 09:23.810
如果我把锡拉拿出来  你的手下就会射杀我
If I bring scylla out in the open, your man will shoot me.

09:23.820 --> 09:25.710
那我们平手了
Then I guess we have a standoff.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.170
唯一的区别是
The only thing is

09:28.180 --> 09:30.940
我要的东西不是奄奄一息流血将尽的
what I want isn't gasping for air and losing a pinned of blood

09:31.950 --> 09:33.250
把它给我  迈克
Give it to me, michael.

09:33.260 --> 09:34.820
不行
I can't do that.

09:35.470 --> 09:37.340
把它给我  迈克
Give it to me, michael.

09:37.350 --> 09:39.200
你没有别的选择了
You're running out of options.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.290
我说不行
I said, no.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.560
我们是迈阿密警方
This is Miami Police.

09:41.570 --> 09:42.580
把它给我  迈克
Give it to me, michael.

09:42.590 --> 09:44.020
我们必须撤了
We got to go.

09:46.340 --> 09:47.680
给我去拿
Go get it.

10:02.090 --> 10:03.540
快走  迈克
Come on, michael.

10:07.970 --> 10:09.990
迈克我们必须要走了
michael, we got to go now!

《越狱》第四季 第二十一集
Prison.Break.S04E21

10:45.590 --> 10:47.750
政府帮了你一把
So the government helped you out?

10:47.760 --> 10:49.220
一起经历了这么多
After all we've been through

10:49.230 --> 10:51.000
你知道那听起来有多疯狂吧
You know how crazy that sounds, Huh?

10:51.380 --> 10:53.030

他是在玩弄别人的性命

我的命已经被威胁过一次了

14:49.130 --> 14:50.830

15:07.140 --> 15:08.910

15:12.240 --> 15:15.140
更不是没文化的强奸犯

Whatever happened between you

15:32.280 --> 15:34.120
只要你把我交给他
And michael if you get me back to him,

15:35.170 --> 15:37.640
你们就两清了
the slate could be wiped  clean.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.310
迈克和我是绝对不可能两清的
With michael and me, that slate's never going to be clean.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.250
如果他不把东西给将军
And if he doesn't give the General what he wants,

15:47.030 --> 15:49.700
这里会变得无比肮脏的
It's going to get a hell of a lot dirtier.

15:55.310 --> 15:56.980

15:56.990 --> 15:59.050
我要确认林肯还活着

就当做是炸警察的吧
Let's pretend it was for the cops.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.170

16:16.950 --> 16:19.470
林肯还好吗

我就能从你眼睛里看出来
I could see it in your eyes just

16:25.310 --> 16:26.980

16:26.990 --> 16:27.930
让他听电话

16:32.150 --> 16:33.580
我没理由给你锡拉
Have no reason to give you

16:33.590 --> 16:36.240
所以我有这个资格

16:50.160 --> 16:51.840
知道你还活着真好

How much time do I have?

16:53.710 --> 16:54.870
不多

16:54.880 --> 16:55.920
将军挟持了莎拉
The General has sara.

16:55.930 --> 16:57.910
他给我一小时  用锡拉换她
He's giving me an hour to exchange her for Scylla.

我老婆怎么办

你从来不会没有计划
You haven't gone a day in your life without a plan.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.000

18:22.910 --> 18:28.210
我只知道我还有43分钟把这个给将军
All I know is I have 43 minutes to get this to the General.

18:28.980 --> 18:30.270
我不再做计划了
I am done making plans.

18:30.290 --> 18:33.840
其他人都去死吧

18:41.310 --> 18:43.150
在外场晃悠
Hang out on the sidelines,

18:43.160 --> 18:45.050

18:55.300 --> 18:57.500
你现在在哪匹马上
Which horse are you backing now?

18:57.510 --> 19:00.930
对这问题  我不是很清楚
Because I'm not quite clear on that.

19:10.110 --> 19:12.350
至少你还有得选
At least you got a decision.

19:14.490 --> 19:17.000
他们杀了我儿子
They took my son.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.490
我没得选

我告诉过他我不是这块料
I told him I was not cut out for it.

20:16.530 --> 20:18.770
不是我的天性
It is not in my nature.

他以前叫我  他的麦克白女士
He used to call me his lady Macbeth.

20:26.650 --> 20:30.030

I knew there was a reason I hated shakespeare.

You hated it because you couldn't understand it.

20:34.310 --> 20:35.750

Because your real mother was as dumb as a day-old doughnut.

20:42.750 --> 20:43.890
你问我
You asked me

20:43.900 --> 20:49.400
我怎么就坐看着我儿子去上电椅
how I could just sit and watch my son go into the chair.

20:51.670 --> 20:55.930
答案很简单
The answer's simple really.

20:55.940 --> 21:00.390
你不是我儿子
You're not my son.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.050
迈克已经知道了
michaelalready knows.

21:03.110 --> 21:06.980
肯定是因为这个  他才轻易放弃了你
That must be why it's so easy for him to p  lay with your life.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.910
我想我们是有共同点的
I guess we have that in common.

21:10.910 --> 21:13.200
现在去找我儿子
Now, go find my son.

21:14.430 --> 21:15.600
你的资料会让你被捕
Your information leads to an

21:15.610 --> 21:17.590
我们会保证法庭不会对你动手
Arrest, we'll make sure the courts can't touch you.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.670
你能立字为据吗  然后再做事
Can you put that in writing? And then we'll do business.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.650
不不  你唯一能要求写下的
No, no. The only thing you get to demand in writing

21:22.660 --> 21:23.630
是你的墓志铭
is what we will put on your tomb stone.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.940
你们最不想发生的
The last thing you are gonna want to

21:24.950 --> 21:26.980
就是发现那兄弟俩在外杀人
Find out about is the brothers is killing somebody else,

21:26.990 --> 21:29.960
而你们却在这刁难唯一的线人
While you are in here harassing your only source of intel

21:29.970 --> 21:33.740
那个必须写下来  并由司法部长签字
It's need to be in writing, and signed by the attorney General.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.350
我不相信任何自称为政府工作的人
I don't trust anyone who says they work for the government.

21:37.770 --> 21:42.310
你要做的就是给兄弟俩打电话
All you have to do is call the brothers.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.350
让他们听电话  我来讲
Get them on the phone and let me talk to them.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.700
让他们自己决定  好吗
Then they can make up their own minds, all right?

21:47.710 --> 21:50.400
我不想再搅和这事了
I'm just trying to stay out of all this.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.450
我好不容易家庭团聚
I finally got my family back

21:52.460 --> 21:54.790
不想再次冒险失去他们
And not about so risk losing them again.

21:54.810 --> 21:58.040
我知道现在很幸福
I know this feels good today

21:59.050 --> 22:01.610
那几个月后呢
But what about a couple months from now

22:01.940 --> 22:04.290
你能找的工作都是黑工
When the only job you can get is under the table or

22:04.300 --> 22:07.040
或者贩人蛇  每时每刻
Some labour gill or every minute you will be worrying if

22:07.120 --> 22:10.990
总是担心旁边的人会大声报警
The guy next to you is going to drop the dime in a hard beep

22:11.000 --> 22:13.300
因为他认出你了
because he recognizes you.

22:13.310 --> 22:15.970
找到林肯和迈克又能怎样呢
How is finding lincoln and michaelare changing any of that?

22:15.980 --> 22:18.310
这个人帮我搞定了啊
This guy sought me out, okay?

22:18.530 --> 22:20.730
他了解整件事
He knows everything about the whole thing.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.820
他是谁  是政府的人吗
Who is he? Is he government?

22:21.830 --> 22:23.050
如果他是政府的人  我可不想
'Cause if he's government, I don't wanna...

22:23.060 --> 22:25.220
我开始也不相信他
I didn't trust him first either, okay?

22:25.230 --> 22:26.620
但纸上的东西让我改变想法
But something about being in the pen.

22:26.630 --> 22:30.760
你可以辨认谁是玩家  谁是阿飞
You start to decipher who is a player and who is a punk.

22:31.320 --> 22:36.270
这个人和斯科菲尔德一样  是玩家
And this guy is a player, just like scofield.

22:38.620 --> 22:40.510
现在要做的就是
So the only thing we have to do

22:40.520 --> 22:42.590
告诉他兄弟俩在哪
is tell him where the brothers are,

22:42.600 --> 22:45.890
把那装置还回去  该给谁给谁
Get this device thing back in and so he can put it into the right hands.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.730
然后呢
Then what?

22:49.480 --> 22:51.100
这哥们很牛的
This brother has juice.

22:51.110 --> 22:54.340
他可以抹掉我们所有的记录
He can erase our entire record.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.150
我不是说钱或者浮华的东西
I'm not talking about cash and all that flashy stuff.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.460
是说直接就自由了
I'm talking about straight up freedom.

22:59.470 --> 23:01.570
像正常人一样  听懂没
Living like a man, you feel me?

23:05.340 --> 23:05.960
当然不  南多
No, of course, Nandu.

23:07.980 --> 23:08.790
是是
Yes, yes.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.330
只是出现了一点技术问题
We just ran into a few technical difficulties.

23:11.830 --> 23:12.930
我理解
I understand.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.960
如果你多给我们一点点时间  我就
If you give us a little more Time, then I --

23:16.060 --> 23:16.590
不不  别

23:17.480 --> 23:19.400
拜托了  不要登机
Please don't get on the plane.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.280

23:27.750 --> 23:29.090
不
No.

23:31.350 --> 23:34.990
你刚让我损失了7.5亿美元啊
You just cost me 3/4 of a billion dollars.

23:35.870 --> 23:37.390
很好
Good.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.610
至少今天不是完全浪费了
At least the day wasn't a total waste.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.290
我本打算等找到迈克
I was going to wait until I found michael

23:41.300 --> 23:44.670
在他面前杀了你
And just kill you in front of him.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.970
但我准备让你一个人
But instead I'm going to take you out

23:45.980 --> 23:47.290
怎么来的怎么走
the same way you came in, alone.

23:51.650 --> 23:54.040

你现在派谁来都太晚了
Whoever you've sent after it is too late.

迈克正要把锡拉去和将军换莎拉
michael's giving scylla back to the general in exchange for sara's life.

23:59.850 --> 24:01.490
你他妈是谁?

24:01.500 --> 24:04.480
阿历克斯·马宏 我们还没见过面

24:32.520 --> 24:34.340

24:34.350 --> 24:37.690
对 但这家伙一直对我直言不讳 不像他弟弟
