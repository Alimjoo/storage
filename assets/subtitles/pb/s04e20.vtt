00:01.300 --> 00:02.550
《越狱》 前情提要
Previously on prison break.

00:02.560 --> 00:03.960
你准备什么时候告诉我
When were you planning on

00:03.970 --> 00:06.720
你母亲是幕后主使
Telling me that your mother was behind you on this?

00:06.730 --> 00:09.200
你只有今天一天的时间了
You have today, one day.

00:10.270 --> 00:12.180
当布鲁斯把锡拉带回来的时候
When Burrows brings Scylla back to us,

00:12.190 --> 00:15.730
你就是让他脑袋开花的那个人
You will be the one to put a bullet in his brain.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.740
纳文·班纳吉
Naveen banerjee,

00:17.750 --> 00:20.520
是南都·班纳吉总理的儿子
The son of prime minister Nandu Banerjee.

00:20.530 --> 00:23.640
当这一切都过去了
Soon, this will all be behind us,

00:23.650 --> 00:25.490
我可能还有机会见到我的孙子
And maybe I can meet my grandson.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.610
林肯在哪里
Where's Linc?!

00:26.620 --> 00:28.410
现在正在开一个能源会议
There's an energy conference.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.480
在熊猫湾酒店  他会在那里
The Panda Bay Hotel. He'll be there.

00:30.490 --> 00:31.850
克里斯蒂娜的计划
Christina's plan...

00:31.850 --> 00:33.580
她利用锡拉从中渔利所欠的东风
what she needed to profit from Scylla,

00:33.580 --> 00:36.600
就是一种让事态升级为世界大战的催化剂
an incident that'll domino into global warfare.

00:37.430 --> 00:39.070
不要
No!

00:42.470 --> 00:43.800
他们用林肯的名字租了这个
They rented this in Linc's name.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.380
看看这里  这是个陷阱
Look at this. It's a setup!

00:45.390 --> 00:47.570
弹壳上都是他的指纹
His hands are all over the shells.

00:48.980 --> 00:50.640
林肯这回可是竹篮打水一场空了
Lincoln's right back where he started.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.500
这样对迈克尔太残忍了
It really is too bad about Michael.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.280
我们得赶快离开
We gotta go.

00:58.790 --> 01:00.250
我需要医生
I need a doctor here!

01:07.030 --> 01:09.190
他们在那里
There they are!

01:09.200 --> 01:11.210
他们在楼上
They're up there! They're up there!

01:11.220 --> 01:12.570
我们快上楼
Let's go upstairs, now!

01:12.580 --> 01:14.220
快上  上
Move it, move it!

01:15.840 --> 01:18.330
我们混到人群里面吧
Look, let's just blend into the crowd.

01:18.340 --> 01:19.660
我们不能那么出去
No, we can't go that way.

01:19.670 --> 01:21.420
门锁上了  迈克尔
The door is locked, Michael.

01:21.430 --> 01:23.780
退后
Stand back.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.740
这事越来越麻烦了
This whole thing is falling apart.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.430
你觉得呢
Is it?

02:07.440 --> 02:09.380
真的吗
Is it really?

02:09.390 --> 02:10.550
你觉得现在这样很好笑吗
What, do you think this is funny? Huh?

02:10.560 --> 02:11.720
你觉得这事情会多快
How long do you think it's gonna take

02:11.730 --> 02:13.050
传到将军那里去的
Before the general sees this on the news?

02:13.060 --> 02:14.520
如果他觉得我们拿不到锡拉
If he thinks we can't get Scylla,

02:14.530 --> 02:16.940
你觉得他会花多久时间来灭了我们
How long do you think it's gonna take before he comes after us?

02:16.950 --> 02:18.420
我们的家人也将在劫难逃
And then he comes after our families?

02:18.430 --> 02:20.250
确实很搞笑  对吧
Yeah, it's really funny, isn't it?

02:45.810 --> 02:47.390
迈克尔  你在哪
Michael, where are you?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.390
我们还在宾馆里
We're still in the hotel.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.390
有没有其他办法
Is there any other way

02:49.400 --> 02:50.640
出来的时候不被人发现吗
To get out of here without being seen?

02:50.650 --> 02:52.720
没有  到处都是警察和联邦探员
No, there's cops and feds all over the place.

02:52.730 --> 02:53.810
你拿到锡拉了吗
Did you get Scylla?

02:53.820 --> 02:55.010
没有
No.

02:55.020 --> 02:56.460
有人被暗杀了
Some guy got assassinated.

02:56.470 --> 02:58.410
你猜猜谁又被陷害了
And guess who got set up for it.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.470
我们需要锡拉
We need Scylla.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.820
锡拉不见了
Scylla is gone!

03:02.830 --> 03:04.320
我现在只想
The only thing I care about right now

03:04.330 --> 03:05.470
从这里逃出去
Is getting out of here.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.970
是吗  你能往哪儿逃呢  迈克尔
Oh, yeah? Where you gonna go, Michael, huh?

03:06.980 --> 03:09.750
我们会再次陷入公司的穷追猛打中
With the company breathing down our back again.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.360
斯科菲尔德  我是当
Scofield, it's Don.

03:13.370 --> 03:14.450
你想干什么
What do you want?

03:14.460 --> 03:15.500
帮你解决问题
To try to fix this.

03:15.510 --> 03:16.610
怎么解决
How?

03:16.620 --> 03:17.780
又想背后捅我们一刀
By stabbing us in the back again?

03:17.790 --> 03:19.170
让阿历克斯和我说话
Put alex on.

03:19.180 --> 03:20.950
他现在不太好分心
He's a little preoccupied right now.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.990
如果你想冲我发火
Look, you want to be mad at me,

03:23.000 --> 03:24.890
等我们拿到了锡拉再发火也不迟
be mad at me after we get Scylla back.

03:24.890 --> 03:25.820
现在听我说
Now listen to me.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.380
西南边的卸货区有一扇工业门
Okay, the southwest loading dock is a large industrial door.

03:28.390 --> 03:30.260
不是一个快速逃生口
It's not conducive to a quick exit.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.350
只有一个警察把守着
They only have one cop on it.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.630
你们到门口时  我来解决那个警察
When you get to the door, I can incapacitate the cop.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.720
问题是  我们在宾馆的另一边
Problem is, we're on the other side of the hotel,

03:36.730 --> 03:37.840
而他们把一楼封锁了
and they've got the ground floor covered.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.800
你们在外边还看见了什么
What else can you see on the outside?

03:39.810 --> 03:41.110
没了  只有警察
Nothing, just the cop,

03:41.120 --> 03:44.030
垃圾箱  叉车和装换洗衣服的箱子
A couple of dumpsters, jack pallets and some laundry bins.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.280
那就是说宾馆的洗衣房在另一边
That must mean the on-site laundry's on the other side of the hotel,

03:47.290 --> 03:49.030
靠近卸货区大门
Near the loading dock door.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.520
如果我们能到洗衣房  我们就能到大门
If we get to the laundry, we can get to the door.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.150
你说过我们不能到宾馆另一边
You said we can't make it across the hotel.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.460
但是我们可以从屋顶过去
But we can get access to the roof.

03:56.530 --> 03:58.290
宾馆都是用屋顶通风设备
Hotels use rooftop ventilation,

03:58.300 --> 04:00.130
这样  客人才不会闻到洗衣房的味道
So the hotel guests don't smell the laundry fumes.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.130
那好  那就从通风设施那边
Okay, so, listen, take the ventilation system

04:05.140 --> 04:07.200
到洗衣房  如果你们能到洗衣房
To the laundry room. If you can get to the laundry room,

04:07.210 --> 04:08.890
你们就能到大门口
You're gonna get right by the door.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.840
打开免提功能
Put me on speaker.

04:12.550 --> 04:15.310
阿历克斯  你想摆脱公司对我们的纠缠吗
Alex, you want to get the company off our backs?

04:15.320 --> 04:16.870
到邓恩街4号
Go to 4 Dunn place.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.810
莎拉正看着我妈
Sara's holding my mother there.

04:18.820 --> 04:20.900
让她告诉我们锡拉在什么地方
Make her tell us where Scylla is.

04:20.910 --> 04:22.690
还我们一个清白
And clear our names in all this.

04:24.660 --> 04:28.550
马宏  你一定要想尽一切办法撬开她的嘴
Mahone, you need to do whatever you gotta do to get her talk

04:28.560 --> 04:29.890
你明白吗
You hear me?

04:29.900 --> 04:30.890
该怎么做  就怎么做
Do whatever you gotta do.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.750
明白
Got it.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.650
我们走
Come on.

《越狱》第四季 第二十集
Prison.Break.S04E20

05:07.100 --> 05:09.090
熊猫湾酒店现在是一片混乱
It is complete mayhem at the Panda Bay Hotel

05:09.100 --> 05:11.310
纳文·班纳吉  印度总理的儿子
Where Naveen Banerjee, The son of india's prime minister,

05:11.320 --> 05:12.560
在这里被暗杀了
Has been assassinated.

05:12.570 --> 05:15.200
有趣的是  有小道消息透露
Amazingly, there have been unconfirmed reports

05:15.210 --> 05:18.350
暗杀者正是林肯·布鲁斯
Identifying the assailants as none other than Lincoln Burrows,

05:18.350 --> 05:20.710
杀害泰伦斯·斯坦曼的那个嫌疑犯
the man who'd been suspected of murdering Terrence Steadman,

05:20.720 --> 05:22.580
还有他弟弟兼策划者迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
And Michael Scofield, his mastermind brother...

05:22.580 --> 05:24.720
克里斯蒂娜把我们都给耍了
Christina sandbagged all of us!

05:26.800 --> 05:28.630
如果他们兄弟俩被抓了
If the brothers are caught,

05:28.640 --> 05:30.210
我们就不能保证
We have no control over what

05:30.220 --> 05:31.970
他们会对警察说什么了
They might say to the authorities.

05:31.980 --> 05:33.470
到酒店去
Get down to that hotel

05:33.480 --> 05:35.790
保证他们不会胡说八道
And make sure they don't have that opportunity.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.290
将军  我非常愿意来接手这项行动
Uh, general, I'd be more than willing to take on that assignment.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.590
我保证  我一定会指挥有方的
And I assure you I will dispatch of it efficiently.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.430
泰迪  我们不是在玩捕猎游戏
This is not an alabama coon hunt, Teddy.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.960
别以为我是一时冲动
Don't judge me by desperate actions

05:46.970 --> 05:48.600
刀架在脖子上的日子我都挺过来了
I've taken when there's been a gun to my head.

05:48.610 --> 05:50.320
我领导监狱里的黑帮
I ran an entire prison gang syndicate.

05:50.330 --> 05:51.820
再心狠手辣的罪犯都奉我为上宾
Hardened felons called me "Mister."

05:51.830 --> 05:54.110
我不是一个告密的小人
I'm so much more than a snitch.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.970
如果你以为我只是那样的人
And if you continue to treat me as such,

05:55.980 --> 05:59.140
那就是你的损失  我无所谓  将军阁下
It will be your loss, General, not mine.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.950
孩子  我手里掌握着一家几百万亿
Son, I have the fate of a multi-trillion dollar

06:02.950 --> 06:04.620
资产公司的命运
enterprise in my hands,

06:04.630 --> 06:10.960
你认为现在我会让你大出风头吗
And you want me to let you earn your stripes now?!

06:11.850 --> 06:13.570
摆平那兄弟俩
Take care of the brothers.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.150
应该是这了
This should be it.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.450
好极了
Perfect.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.560
他们说我们的人马上就到
They say ours should be here shortly.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.900
你们要提高警惕
I want you guys on full alert

06:37.910 --> 06:40.020
时刻准备行动  好吗
And get all geared up, all right?

06:40.030 --> 06:41.070
他们在那
It's them!

06:41.080 --> 06:42.880
别动
Stop!

07:02.480 --> 07:04.890
他们会在任何一层楼出现
They could be on any floor.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.710
你能控制所有的门锁吗
Can you override the door locks?

07:06.720 --> 07:07.730
可以  都是电子锁
Yeah, they're electronic.

07:07.740 --> 07:08.930
我们在楼下控制
We control everything from down here.

07:08.940 --> 07:12.860
我要酒店的所有房间门都锁上
I want every room in this hotel locked down now!

07:16.750 --> 07:18.690
我们为什么不走楼梯去天台
Why don't we just take the stairs to the roof?

07:18.700 --> 07:20.740
因为我们将拉响火警
Because we'll set off the fire alarm.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.330
通过顶楼房间上方夹层的管道
The ducts in the crawl spaces above these top floor rooms,

07:23.340 --> 07:25.950
才是我们到天台的通道
That's how we get our rooftop access.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.780
只要我们找到了洗衣房的通风口
Once we find the laundry vent,

07:27.790 --> 07:30.230
我们就从那里到卸货区
We take that down to the loading dock.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.550
门全锁了
That should do it.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.800
出什么事了
What's going on?

08:07.630 --> 08:09.160
他们把我们关在门外了
They locked us out.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.410
我们到不了天台
We can't get to the roof.

08:10.420 --> 08:11.580
那我们往回走下楼去
Let's head back down.

08:11.590 --> 08:12.940
警察会在楼梯井等着我们
There'll be cops in the stairwell.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.610
无论上下  我们都走投无路了
We can't go up, we can't go down...

08:16.300 --> 08:18.060
我们被困住了
We're trapped.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.290
熊猫湾暗杀事件现在有了新的进展
There has been a new development in the Panda Bay assassination.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.890
有匿名消息透露
An anonymous source has provided Fox

08:27.900 --> 08:31.150
有文件显示  布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德
With documents showing a wire transfer

08:31.160 --> 08:34.020
从中国特工处得到了一笔汇款
From Chinese operatives to Burrows and Scofield.

08:34.030 --> 08:36.240
从地理政治角度来看
The fallout from this from a geopolitical standpoint

08:36.250 --> 08:38.160
这件事的负面影响震惊世人
Is staggering.

08:38.170 --> 08:40.130
中国和印度的关系...
Relations between China and India...

08:40.130 --> 08:41.440
南都联系我们了
Nandu reached out.

08:41.450 --> 08:44.580
他想见你
He wants to meet with you.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.310
这事只能这么办了
This couldn't have worked out better.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.450
中方的假文件伪造得不错
Nice audible on the Chinese document.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.700
谢谢
Thank you.

08:50.710 --> 08:53.490
现在  我们只要
Now we just...

08:53.500 --> 08:55.800
静观其变就可以了
Watch the dominoes begin to fall.

08:57.350 --> 09:00.130
我希望他们不要为难迈克尔
I just wish they weren't falling on Michael.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.000
克里斯蒂娜  你给过他活路
Christina, you gave him options,

09:03.010 --> 09:05.570
他走了自己的路  选择和我们干到底
He made his choice, he picked his side.

09:07.010 --> 09:09.640
是的  但他终究是我儿子
Yes, but he is my son.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.680
我唯一的儿子
My only son.

09:15.690 --> 09:17.110
现在  我们相信
And right now it is believed

09:17.120 --> 09:18.530
布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德
Both Burrows and Scofield

09:18.540 --> 09:19.810
仍然在酒店里
Are still in the hotel,

09:19.820 --> 09:22.320
警方正一步步缩小包围圈
But it appears the police are closing in.

09:22.330 --> 09:27.300
熊猫湾酒店  现场报道
Live just outside the Panda Bay Hotel...

09:27.710 --> 09:29.690
不行  迈克尔  这就是问题所在
No, no, no, you see, that's the problem, Michael.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.020
到处都是警察
There's cops everywhere.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.880
就好像是蚂蚁们倾巢出动了一样
It's like a freaking cop anthill out here.

09:32.890 --> 09:35.880
他们找到你们只不过是时间问题
Look, it's just a matter of time till they find you anyway.

09:35.890 --> 09:38.030
搞清楚他们的进攻方案
Find out what their plan of attack is.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.530
好啊  告诉你
Sure, you know what?

09:39.540 --> 09:41.890
我现在就过去问问他们  行了吧
Yeah, I'll just go up and ask them, all right?

09:41.900 --> 09:43.700
他们非常和蔼可亲
They look like a real friendly bunch.

09:43.710 --> 09:46.030
我们没多少时间了  速战速决吧
We don't have much time, so get it done now!

09:49.240 --> 09:51.400
布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德有可能全副武装
Burrows and Scofield could be armed to the teeth.

09:51.410 --> 09:52.710
楼梯的空间很窄
It's tight quarters in the stairwell,

09:52.720 --> 09:54.180
我不想看到枪战  明白吗
So I don't want a lot of shooting, all right?

09:54.190 --> 09:55.220
这家伙是国土安全局的
This guy's from Homeland Security.

09:55.230 --> 09:56.880
我逮捕了枪手之后
I'll file my report as soon as

09:56.890 --> 09:58.220
就会把报告发过去
I've apprehended the shooters.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.940
队长  我希望你搞明白
Whoa, whoa, let me be clear here, captain.

10:00.950 --> 10:02.060
今天的暗杀
The shooting that happened today

10:02.070 --> 10:03.440
不是普通的团伙暴力
Wasn't your typical gangbanger,

10:03.450 --> 10:05.610
迈阿密的破案环境是不是让你退化了
Public service killing you're used to here in Miami.

10:05.620 --> 10:08.700
这是国际性质的暗杀活动
This was an international assassination with ramifications

10:08.710 --> 10:10.910
直接影响了我们国家的安全
That directly affect the security of this country.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.950
如果  你再对我爱理不理的
So, if you turn your back on me again,

10:12.960 --> 10:15.860
我会以妨碍联邦调查让你吃不了兜着走
I'll jam you up for hindering a federal investigation.

10:15.860 --> 10:16.760
你明白吗
You understand?

10:18.770 --> 10:20.240
好吧
Fine.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.910
但是  你要跟在我后面
But I want you on my hip.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.210
我不会让你来转一圈之后
I'm not gonna have you running around playing

10:24.220 --> 10:25.880
让你回去好跟你的朋友吹嘘
So you can go back to your buddies at the office

10:25.890 --> 10:27.800
你经历过真正的枪林弹雨  懂吗
And tell them you saw some real gun play, understood?

10:27.810 --> 10:29.020
没问题
Not a problem.

10:29.030 --> 10:30.220
那你现在告诉我
Now, why don't you start by telling me

10:30.230 --> 10:32.250
你准备怎么解决问题
How you're gonna diffuse the situation?

10:32.260 --> 10:34.920
我们会逐层放烟雾弹  直到找到他们
We're gonna gas them out floor by floor until we find them.

10:34.930 --> 10:36.920
等一下  如果你要用烟雾弹
Whoa, hold on there, tex. If you use gas you're gonna

10:36.930 --> 10:38.760
你们也什么都看不见  我不能
Compromise visibility ,and I can't afford

10:38.770 --> 10:40.590
再冒险让某个外交官脑袋挨枪子儿了
Another diplomat getting shot in the fez.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.310
我们用的是氯丙烷
We're using chloropropane.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.100
无色  无味
It's colorless, it's odorless.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.160
他们根本不会察觉到自己是怎么中的招
They won't even know what hit them.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.870
大家听好
All right, listen up.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.120
两个人在东边的楼梯井放烟雾
I want two men in the east stairwell with the gas,

10:51.130 --> 10:52.770
两个在西边楼梯底下
Two at the base of the west stairwell

10:52.780 --> 10:54.410
防止他们再往楼下逃
In case they try to come back down again.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.290
我会准备好后援  行了吗
I'll have backup detail ready, all right?

10:56.300 --> 10:58.420
行动  动作快
Let's go, move, move!

11:24.450 --> 11:26.970
莎拉
Sara?

11:31.200 --> 11:32.650
天哪
Oh, my god.

11:32.660 --> 11:33.980
莎拉
Sara.

11:33.990 --> 11:36.150
莎拉
Sara,

11:36.160 --> 11:37.370
你受伤了吗  你还好吧
You hurt? You okay?

11:37.380 --> 11:39.340
我还好  克里斯蒂娜跑了
I'm fine. Christina's gone.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.920
最下面抽屉里面有刀
There's a knife in the last drawer.

11:40.930 --> 11:42.760
你知道她去哪了吗
Do you have any idea where she went?

11:42.770 --> 11:45.520
不知道
No.

11:46.970 --> 11:51.000
锡拉在她手里
She has Scylla.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.930
她设计陷害了林肯和迈克尔
She set up Linc and Michael.

11:52.940 --> 11:53.930
她可能躲在任何地方
She could be anywhere.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.390
迈克尔和林肯
Michael and Lincoln?

11:55.400 --> 11:58.530
他们现在背上了杀害印度官员的黑锅
Yeah, they were framed for the murder of an Indian official.

11:58.530 --> 11:59.840
他们现在是新闻头条
It's all over the news.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.650
这个克里斯蒂娜的计划
That was Christina's plan, and...

12:01.650 --> 12:03.120
他们现在在哪
Where are they now?

12:03.120 --> 12:04.780
被困在了熊猫湾酒店里
They're trapped at the Panda Bay Hotel.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.560
警察正在找他们
The police are looking for them.

12:06.570 --> 12:07.860
知道了
Okay.

12:07.870 --> 12:10.070
你不能过去
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't go there.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.090
到处都是警察
The cops are everywhere.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.750
你不要拦着我
I really need you to get out of my way

12:12.750 --> 12:13.990
这我办不到
Well, that's not gonna happen.

12:15.370 --> 12:18.280
你不关心我  我也不关心你
You don't care for me, I don't care for you

12:18.280 --> 12:22.340
但是我欠迈克尔的  你逃吧
Much either, but I owe Michael, okay? Run.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.000
他现在正在水深火热之中
He's in a sea of trouble right now.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.150
我不会抛弃他
I'm not abandoning him.

12:25.150 --> 12:25.990
我不是让你抛弃他
I'm not telling you

12:25.990 --> 12:27.540
你什么忙也帮不了
To abandon him. There's nothing you can do for him.

12:27.540 --> 12:28.860
我要是想跑  早就跑了
Listen, I'd run if I could run.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.720
但是我跑的话  他们就会对我老婆下手
But if I run, they go after my wife,

12:30.730 --> 12:32.260
所以我才会再陷泥沼
So I have to jump back in.

12:32.270 --> 12:33.260
你不需要
You don't.

12:33.270 --> 12:35.480
我不会逃避
I'm not running.

12:39.560 --> 12:42.020
我要留在这里
I'll stay here, okay?

12:42.030 --> 12:43.990
这样  迈克尔才会知道我在哪
That way, Michael knows where I am.

12:44.860 --> 12:46.850
克里斯蒂娜也会知道
So does Christina.

12:46.860 --> 12:49.270
如果她想让我死  我早就死了
If she wanted me dead, I would be already.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.110
随便你吧
Suit yourself.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.970
阿历克斯
Alex?

12:58.080 --> 12:59.110
谢谢你
Thanks.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.700
如果你看见迈克尔  告诉他我在这里
And if you see Michael, tell him I'm here.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.340
好的
Yeah.

13:05.730 --> 13:08.900
我明白这对你有多痛苦
I know how difficult this must be for you.

13:08.900 --> 13:12.100
总理先生  我也失去了一个儿子
Mr. Prime Minister, I, too, lost a son

13:12.110 --> 13:13.860
当他还是个孩童的时候
When he was just a child.

13:13.860 --> 13:18.030
你的儿子是被刺客害死的吗
Was your son murdered by an assailant's bullet?

13:18.030 --> 13:19.530
当然不是
Of course not.

13:21.580 --> 13:25.920
有消息说那帮中国人是幕后主使
I've heard the news that the Chinese are behind this.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.370
对  我也听说了
Yes, I've heard that as well.

13:29.370 --> 13:30.760
所以我来这儿了
And that's why I'm here.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.260
不是为了讨论我儿子是怎么死的
Not to discuss how my son died,

13:33.260 --> 13:34.760
而是怎么为他报仇雪恨
But how to avenge him.

13:34.760 --> 13:39.080
你所说的 "技术"
Your technology-- as you put it--

13:39.080 --> 13:42.430
我听说了有关它多种用途的风声
I've heard rumors of its varied applications.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.300
南都  我们稍安勿躁
Nandu, let's take a breath here.

13:44.300 --> 13:50.310
不  我儿子死的那一刻我就无法平静了
No! The time to take a breath expired when my son died.

13:50.310 --> 13:53.760
你儿子和我已经计划把这项技术
Your son and I had planned to use the technology

13:53.760 --> 13:56.770
用于人道主义关怀
For humanitarian endeavors.

13:56.770 --> 13:59.770
我们的目标不是将其用于战争
Warfare applications were not our goal.

13:59.770 --> 14:02.570
但既然它们已经归我了  而且归根结底
But now they are mine, and at the end of the day,

14:02.570 --> 14:04.240
你只是一个做买卖的商人
You're a businesswoman with a product

14:04.240 --> 14:05.490
而我是买家
And I am a buyer.

14:05.490 --> 14:09.410
我要买下你所拥有的全部知识产权
I want to commit to all the intellectual property you possess.

14:09.410 --> 14:14.420
我要中国血债血偿
I want the People's Republic of China To feel the pain I feel right now!

14:15.620 --> 14:20.020
你清楚
Do you comprehend the ramifications

14:20.120 --> 14:22.320
你这项提议的后果吗
Of what it is you're proposing?

14:24.330 --> 14:28.730
比你还清楚
More than you know.

14:33.860 --> 14:36.160
如你所愿
If it is what you want.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.660
我必须得走了
I must go now...

14:40.900 --> 14:44.590
准备付款事宜
To make arrangements for your payment

14:44.590 --> 14:47.840
和我儿子的葬礼
And arrangements for my child's burial.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.650
喂
Yeah?

15:19.660 --> 15:21.660
恭喜啊  你们又出名了
Congratulations. You're famous again.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.290
新闻上全都在说你们杀了另一个甘地
You're all over the news for killing Gandhi.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.160
我也料到会这样
I figured as much.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.250
对啊  情况越来越糟糕了
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.660
-他们要用烟雾弹逼你们出来  -什么时候
- They're gonna gas you out. - When?

15:29.670 --> 15:31.120
他们已经在行动了  他们在一层层排查
They already started. They're going floor-by-floor.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.950
现在大概已经到达第三或第四层楼了
They're about at the third or fourth floor right now.

15:32.950 --> 15:35.300
你现在为什么要告诉我这些
Why are you just telling me about this now?

15:35.300 --> 15:36.790
我必须要离开门廊
I had to leave the lobby.

15:36.790 --> 15:38.440
我不能再引更多人怀疑了
I can't make anybody more suspicious.

15:42.510 --> 15:46.030
喂  迈克尔  迈克尔
Hello, Michael? Michael?

15:47.680 --> 15:51.640
林肯  我需要你的帮助
Linc, I need your help.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.190
我四年级的时候
When I was in fourth grade,

15:53.190 --> 15:56.410
我猜对了试卷上所有答案  结果得了A
I... I got an A for guessing all the answers on this test.

15:56.410 --> 16:00.250
我从没想过我竟能考这么高
I never thought I'd beat those odds.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.370
什么样的倒霉蛋才会在5年内
What kind of loser gets set up

16:03.370 --> 16:08.450
被陷害参与了两桩举世瞩目的刺杀案呢
For two high-profile assassinations within five years?

16:08.450 --> 16:10.320
林肯  这不是你的错
Linc,this is not your fault.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.960
如果他们当时没得逞的话
If they didn't get away with it then,

16:11.960 --> 16:14.130
他们现在也休想办到
They're not gonna get away with it now.

16:14.130 --> 16:16.010
但是我需要你集中精神
But I need you to focus.

16:16.010 --> 16:18.630
我需要你的帮忙  林肯
I need your help, Linc.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.070
没错  我们走
Right. Let's get out of here.

16:33.310 --> 16:34.700
达林·胡克斯  国土安全局
Darrin Hooks, Homeland Security.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.900
能带我去见你们的主管吗
Can you point me to whoever's in charge here?

16:36.900 --> 16:39.820
国土安全局  你们要派多少人过来啊
Homeland? How many of you guys are they sending here?

16:39.820 --> 16:41.400
赛尔夫探员已经进去了
Agent Self's already inside.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.690
谁
Who?

16:42.690 --> 16:44.190
当·赛尔夫探员
Agent Don Self.

16:44.190 --> 16:46.160
刚刚到这儿了不久
Got here a little while ago.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.370
我是胡克斯
Yeah, it's Hooks.

16:54.370 --> 16:59.390
那个应该在洛杉矶死了的探员的名字
The name of that agent that was supposedly killed recently in L.A.?

16:59.390 --> 17:01.640
是不是  当·赛尔夫
Was his name Don Self?

17:07.420 --> 17:11.090
一切都正中克里斯蒂娜下怀
It's all falling out exactly as Christina planned it.

17:11.090 --> 17:15.970
现在她就要得偿所愿了
Now she's going to have everything she ever hoped for.

17:15.970 --> 17:20.430
她想重燃1962年中印边境之战的战火
She's trying to reignite the 1962 China-India Border War

17:20.430 --> 17:22.180
那次冲突好不容易才和解
Which ended in an uneasy truce

17:22.180 --> 17:25.270
那时两国在边远荒芜的山区相持不下
When neither country could withstand the losses

17:25.270 --> 17:27.990
直到双方两败俱伤才罢休
They were sustaining in those remote and desolate mountains.

17:27.990 --> 17:30.900
如果她成功煽动了另一场战争
If she succeeds in provoking another war,

17:30.910 --> 17:33.610
诬陷是中国方面
And framing China

17:33.610 --> 17:36.240
刺杀了印度总理的儿子
For the killing of India's Prime Minister's son,

17:36.240 --> 17:37.440
那就绝对足够有煽动性的了
It's certainly provocation enough.

17:37.450 --> 17:41.580
她会引发一场会持续数十年的军事冲突
She'll set off a military conflict that will last for decades

17:41.580 --> 17:43.990
有可能永无宁日了
That may never be resolved.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.500
你为什么不自己干
Why didn't you do it yourself?

17:45.500 --> 17:50.620
权力  金钱  似乎是你钟爱的东西
Power, money, seem to be things you love.

17:50.630 --> 17:54.010
因为如果印度牵涉进来  巴基斯坦也会
Because if India's involved, that drags in Pakistan.

17:54.010 --> 17:56.100
然后俄罗斯就要开始防御它的边境了
Then Russia's gonna want to defend its borders.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.520
然后不到一年  整个欧洲都牵扯其中
Then within a year, Europe's in it

17:58.520 --> 17:59.970
接着就是美国
And after that, the United States.

17:59.970 --> 18:02.690
这是一场同归于尽的灾难
It's an apocalypse in which everyone loses!

18:02.690 --> 18:06.170
克里斯蒂娜一直都太自傲
And Christina has always been too prideful

18:06.170 --> 18:09.360
太反复无常  不愿接受这个事实
And too unstable to accept that.

18:37.010 --> 18:38.440
明白了
Got it.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.010
需要帮忙吗
Can I help you?

18:46.010 --> 18:49.980
你好  我想你能帮忙
Hi. Yes, I think you can.

18:58.690 --> 19:00.080
赛尔夫探员
Agent Self.

19:05.170 --> 19:07.530
唐纳德·赛尔夫
Donald Self?

19:14.090 --> 19:16.310
我是达林·胡克斯探员
Agent Darrin Hooks.

19:23.270 --> 19:24.520
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.220
也很高兴见到你
It's good to see you, too.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.700
站住  别动  别动
Hold it. Hold it right there. Don't move.

19:38.700 --> 19:42.620
你到底在做什么  胡克斯
What the hell are you doing, Hooks?

19:42.620 --> 19:44.290
你总要自相残杀吗
You always pull guns on fellow agents?

19:44.290 --> 19:48.080
对  当一个应该已上西天了的探员
Yeah, when agents that are supposedly dead

19:48.080 --> 19:49.450
和杀他的人出现在同一家宾馆的时候
And are found later in a hotel

19:49.450 --> 19:50.910
我就会那么干
With the guys who kill you

19:50.910 --> 19:53.400
能告诉我你和布鲁斯还有斯科菲尔德
You mind telling me what you're doing here

19:53.400 --> 19:54.620
在这里干吗
With Burrows and Scofield?

19:54.620 --> 19:56.020
我的身份不能暴露
My cover called for me

19:56.020 --> 19:57.710
只能装死  明白吗
To be dead, okay?

19:57.710 --> 19:59.230
人们会理解我们的所作所为的
People were catching on to what we were doing,

19:59.230 --> 20:00.320
我的死让我得以金蝉脱壳
And my death freed me up

20:00.320 --> 20:03.560
但布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德是被陷害的  明白吗
But Burrows and Scofield have been set up, okay?

20:03.560 --> 20:05.140
没有记录显示你在执行秘密任务
There's no record of you in covert ops.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.730
就是这么安排好的
That was by design.

20:06.730 --> 20:08.980
等一切结束了  我们再联系总部
Look, when this is all over, we'll call the home office,

20:08.980 --> 20:10.260
我会输入我的许可代码
I'll punch in my clearance code,

20:10.270 --> 20:12.320
你可以请我喝两杯
You can buy me a couple of drinks,

20:12.320 --> 20:13.850
我俩再分享一下其中的乐趣
And we'll share some laughs about this.

20:13.850 --> 20:16.470
但现在我得完成我的任务
But right now I need to do my damn job.

20:16.470 --> 20:18.110
不行
No.

20:18.110 --> 20:20.970
你跟我走
You're gonna follow

20:20.980 --> 20:22.440
我们现在就把事情弄清楚
And we're gonna clear this up right now.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.950
好  但斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯的事是真的
Okay, but what I said about Scofield and Burrows is true.

20:28.950 --> 20:30.170
他们是被陷害的
They've been set up.

20:30.170 --> 20:31.500
你得调查清楚这件事
You need to look into this.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.170
等我们出去之后
Oh, I'm gonna look into everything

20:33.170 --> 20:34.670
我会把一切都调查清楚
As soon as we get outside.

20:34.670 --> 20:36.120
我们走
Let's go.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.390
你搞定装卸口了吗
Did you clear the loading dock doors?

21:44.390 --> 21:46.990
没有  但是有人做了
No, but someone else did.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.910
什么意思
What do you mean?

21:48.910 --> 21:50.160
有人杀死了警卫
Someone must have taken him out.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.580
也就是说酒店里除了警察
Which means there's someone in the hotel

21:51.580 --> 21:53.500
还有其他人在找你们
Other than the police that's looking for you.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.000
林肯
Linc,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
我们得走了
We got to move.

21:57.010 --> 21:58.710
不止有警察在追我们了
Got more than just the cops after us now.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.040
你知道自己在干什么吗
Whoa, whoa. You know what you're doing?

22:00.040 --> 22:02.710
不知道
No.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.400
我们走
Let's go.

22:14.090 --> 22:15.390
哈钦森队长
Captain Hutchinson!

22:15.390 --> 22:17.770
有间房门被打开了16楼
We've got a room breach on 16.

22:17.780 --> 22:19.590
我是哈钦森
This is Hutchinson.

22:19.590 --> 22:20.930
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯在16楼
Scofield and Burrows are on 16.

22:20.930 --> 22:23.530
重复  斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯在16楼
I repeat, Scofield and Burrows are on 16.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.400
快  快  快
Go, go, go!

22:25.400 --> 22:26.870
上  上  上
Move, move, move!

22:33.910 --> 22:35.910
这边
This way.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.630
确保门能关紧
Make sure the door can shut.

22:42.630 --> 22:44.180
我们需要足够的压力
We need the pressure to build.

22:58.570 --> 23:01.030
他们来了  他们上来了
They're coming. They're coming!

23:14.830 --> 23:17.580
到达16楼
We're on 16.

23:17.590 --> 23:18.840
收到
Copy that.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.420
听我命令
On my mark.

23:21.340 --> 23:22.560
冲
Go.

24:04.170 --> 24:05.250
赶紧增援
Backup detail!

24:05.250 --> 24:06.880
行动  快  快  快
Move! go, go, go, go!

24:07.970 --> 24:09.720
上  上  上  快点
Move, move, move! go, move!

24:09.720 --> 24:12.670
上  上
Move, move!

24:12.670 --> 24:14.040
发生什么事了
What the hell happened?

24:14.040 --> 24:15.390
他们设了陷阱
They booby-trapped us.

24:15.390 --> 24:16.890
他们上了天台
They made a move for the roof.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.510
好的  带他们去医院
All right, get them to a hospital.

24:18.510 --> 24:20.450
好的  我们走  快  快  快
All right. Let's go! Move, move, move!

24:38.780 --> 24:40.280
站住别动
Stop right there!

24:40.280 --> 24:43.340
布鲁斯  休想动手拿枪
Don't make a move for that weapon, Burrows.

24:45.740 --> 24:46.740
把面罩摘了
Take the masks off.

24:46.740 --> 24:48.980
立刻摘了
Take them off now!

24:52.600 --> 24:54.550
手放到脑后
Hands behind your head.

24:54.550 --> 24:56.340
你们最好祈祷
You'd better pray to god that

24:56.340 --> 24:58.300
我的手下没有出事
My men are found out all right.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.750
不过是个冲击波
It was a concussive blast.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.100
他们只是失去知觉了
They're just unconscious.

25:01.110 --> 25:03.020
闭嘴
Shut up.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.110
放松
Easy!

25:06.110 --> 25:08.110
放松
Easy.

25:08.110 --> 25:11.110
就像他刚说的那样  别想动手拿枪
And I'd follow that advice about not going for your guns.

25:11.120 --> 25:16.090
将军要你们回他办公室一趟
The general would like you back at the office.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.240
就现在
Now.

25:37.420 --> 25:40.900
酒店的事进展顺利吗
Did all go well at the hotel?

25:40.900 --> 25:44.620
我妈妈和莎拉怎么样
What's going on with Sara and my mother?

25:44.620 --> 25:46.210
克里斯蒂娜逃走了
Christina escaped.

25:46.210 --> 25:47.570
莎拉没事
Sara's okay.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.210
她还在公寓里
She's in the condo.

25:49.210 --> 25:53.100
打扰一下  你俩是不是想单独聚一聚
Excuse me, would you boys like a little alone time to catch up?

25:53.100 --> 25:55.050
你究竟想要我们做什么
What exactly do you expect from us?

25:55.050 --> 25:57.270
你们得为自己的过失负责
You need to take responsibility for your failures.

25:57.270 --> 25:59.050
我们没有失手
Hey, we failed nothing.

25:59.050 --> 26:01.250
整件事都是个圈套
This whole thing was a setup.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.890
-你明知道  -林肯·布鲁斯果然聪明
- You know it.  - Lincoln Burrows was outsmarted.

26:04.890 --> 26:06.560
谁能料想到那是陷阱呢
Who could have anticipated that?

26:12.600 --> 26:15.070
你得面对现实  一切都已经结束了
I think you need to accept that this is over.

26:17.940 --> 26:21.960
我手上的筹码握得太久了
I've been holding a chip for far too long.

26:21.960 --> 26:25.180
是时候出手了
It's time to play it.

26:25.910 --> 26:28.630
我们有过君子协议
I made you boys a promise.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.300
你们找回锡拉
You would find Scylla

26:30.300 --> 26:34.450
我给你们一笔钱
And I would see to it you got some cash

26:34.460 --> 26:35.810
并毁掉那份名单
And had the slate wiped clean.

26:35.810 --> 26:38.640
我仍想遵守协议
I intend to keep that promise.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.600
然而  如果遵守了一项协议
However, if I keep one promise,

26:41.600 --> 26:43.730
所有的协议都得遵守
I have to keep them all.

26:44.150 --> 26:45.800
现在
Now...

26:45.800 --> 26:47.650
我想看看
I wonder

26:47.650 --> 26:50.820
谁才是那个大赢家
Who the big winner will be.

26:50.820 --> 26:53.940
-别这么做  -别做什么
- Don't do this.  - Don't do what?

26:53.940 --> 26:55.650
我寄信给你们的时候
When I sent you those envelopes,

26:55.650 --> 26:57.190
并不是跟你们开玩笑
I wasn't just playing games

26:57.200 --> 26:59.200
我说得很清楚
I made it very clear

26:59.200 --> 27:00.600
你们只有一天时间
That you had one day

27:00.600 --> 27:02.780
来完成任务
To accomplish your job,

27:02.780 --> 27:05.670
否则后果自负
Or there would be consequences.

27:05.670 --> 27:06.990
那是什么
What's that?

27:06.990 --> 27:08.540
后果
The consequence.

27:08.540 --> 27:10.260
打电话给我们王后区的手下
Call our man in Queens.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.160
王后区  你打电话到纽约干什么
Queens? What are you calling New York for?

27:13.160 --> 27:14.930
麻烦打开免提
Put it on speaker, please.

27:16.380 --> 27:19.380
-请讲  -对4号目标采取行动
- Yes. - Move on Subject Four.

27:19.380 --> 27:20.550
我就一条街的距离
I'm a block away.

27:20.550 --> 27:22.840
预计两分钟内到达
ETA is less than two minutes.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.150
你个王八蛋
You son of a bitch.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.060
你个王八蛋
You son of a bitch!

27:26.060 --> 27:28.010
我老婆只是个手无缚鸡之力的女人
My wife is a defenseless woman.

27:28.010 --> 27:31.150
赛尔夫先生没有透露过他有个老婆  是吧
Mr. Self didn't inform you that he had a wife, did he?

27:31.150 --> 27:33.550
换了是我  也不会说的
Well, I wouldn't talk about my wife either

27:33.550 --> 27:35.900
要是我有点喝高了  酒后驾车
if I'd had a few too many Bourbons, got behind the wheel,

27:35.900 --> 27:40.520
不小心就把个绝代佳人碾成了花椰菜
And turned a beautiful young woman into a piece of broccoli.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.540
别伤害她
Don't do anything.

27:41.540 --> 27:45.080
我猜那才是你要携带锡拉潜逃的原因
I assume that is why you tried to run away with Scylla?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.490
辜负了一个福利只够支付你
To screw a government that was giving you benefits

27:47.490 --> 27:51.430
一个小县城环城高速监管费的政府
that would only pay for a county facility overlooking the belt parkway,

27:51.430 --> 27:55.720
你转手卖了锡拉  你和她就可以从此消失
and to sell it so that you and she could disappear

27:55.720 --> 27:58.310
改头换面  永远逍遥快活了
And be hidden forever.

27:59.710 --> 28:01.010
这就是生活[法语]
C'est la vie.

28:01.010 --> 28:02.180
我看到目标了
I have the subject in sights.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.370
她在医院的院子里坐在轮椅上
She's in a wheelchair under a tree in the hospital courtyard.

28:05.370 --> 28:06.160
可以动手了吗
Do I have a go?

28:06.160 --> 28:07.180
求求你别伤害她
Please don't do this.

28:07.180 --> 28:10.180
求你了  你们可以杀我  你们杀我吧
Okay, please, you can kill me, okay, you can kill me

28:10.190 --> 28:11.940
现在就行  求你了  杀我吧
Right now, please, kill me.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.070
你没必要这样  我们会拿到锡拉的
You don't need to do this. We'll get Scylla.

28:14.070 --> 28:15.270
那才是我想听的答案
That's what I wanted to hear.

28:15.270 --> 28:16.390
那是我们正在做的
Well that's what we'r trying to do

28:16.390 --> 28:18.280
-我们快找到了  -但你们必须知道
- We're getting it. - But you have to know what awaits you

28:18.280 --> 28:21.780
如果失败  等待你们和自己爱人的下场
And your loved ones if you don't.

28:21.780 --> 28:23.060
我们都明白
We understand, okay?

28:23.060 --> 28:24.580
-执行命令  -求求你别这样
- Execute the order. - Please don't do it!

28:25.950 --> 28:28.090
天哪
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

28:28.090 --> 28:30.640
救命  救命
Get help, hel--!

28:34.960 --> 28:38.510
我想你刚才请求了死刑
I believe you made a request.

29:06.740 --> 29:09.410
蒂博格  确保他死定了
Bagwell, make sure he's dead.

29:09.410 --> 29:13.210
大家现在都明白了吗
Does everyone understand now?

29:15.800 --> 29:19.420
我们现在可以同心协力了吗
Are we all on the same page?

29:21.010 --> 29:23.120
很好
Good.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.760
开工了  开工了
Let's get down to business.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.630
7.5亿美元
Three-quarters of a billion dollars

29:29.630 --> 29:32.470
在卢森堡  用的是匿名账户
In a numerical account in Luxembourg.

29:32.470 --> 29:35.690
如果你还关心慈善工作的话
If you are still worried about humanitarian efforts,

29:35.690 --> 29:38.710
给联合国儿童基金会写张支票
Write a check to UNICEF.

29:40.190 --> 29:43.830
24小时内所有数据就会送到
All the data will be delivered within 24 hours.

29:43.830 --> 29:46.880
正合我意
That's what I expected.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.700
你的计划非常成功
You played it perfectly.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.300
联系下我们在中国的联系人
Reach out to our contact in China.

30:01.300 --> 30:05.070
我感觉他们可能也会对我们的货很感兴趣
I have a feeling they may be interested in what we're selling as well.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
克里斯蒂娜  我不建议
Christina, I don't advise

30:11.010 --> 30:12.640
脚踩两只船
Playing both sides of this coin.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.140
瘦猪有食吃
Pigs get fat

30:14.140 --> 30:16.310
肥猪一刀死
And hogs get slaughtered.

30:22.230 --> 30:26.500
去联系中国的联系人
Reach out to China.

30:38.530 --> 30:40.000
不  让我们的人
No! Keep our people

30:40.000 --> 30:42.890
守好佛罗里达和乔治亚州的每个私人机场
At every private airfield in Florida and in Georgia.

30:42.890 --> 30:45.090
我们不能让克里斯蒂娜离开这个州
We can't have Christina leaving the state.

30:45.090 --> 30:47.930
她在玩弄印度人的感情
She played on India's emotions,

30:47.930 --> 30:49.230
可能说明她想在今天与
Which probably means she'd want to meet

30:49.230 --> 30:50.880
其中一个大使会面
With one of their emissaries today

30:50.880 --> 30:51.900
趁自己还很受欢迎
While they're still running hot.

30:51.900 --> 30:53.380
她可能还在迈阿密
She could still be in Miami,

30:53.380 --> 30:54.430
或许就在大使馆里
Maybe at the embassy.

30:54.430 --> 30:57.050
不  她不会在大使馆的
No. She's not at the embassy.

30:57.050 --> 30:58.390
她和印度做的任何交易
Any deal she makes with India

30:58.390 --> 30:59.600
都会绝对地保密
Will be strictly off the radar.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.360
现在她关心的只有2件事
Right now she's concerned with two things.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.360
一件是将锡拉卖出去
One is closing the deal on Scylla,

31:04.360 --> 31:06.390
我先假定她已经完成了
Which I'm assuming she's already done,

31:06.390 --> 31:08.160
第二件事就是拿到钱
And the second is getting paid.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.710
没有赛尔夫的踪迹
No sign of Self.

31:12.230 --> 31:13.730
卖掉锡拉她能拿到多少钱
How much can she get for Scylla?

31:13.730 --> 31:16.740
印度的5亿美金  还有中国的5亿
Half a billion from India, the same from China.

31:16.740 --> 31:17.750
海外账户
Overseas account?

31:17.760 --> 31:19.070
国外电汇吗
Foreign wire transfer?

31:19.070 --> 31:22.290
我怀疑她不会收普通支票
I doubt she's taking any food stamps.

31:22.290 --> 31:24.260
她会确认
She's going to want confirmation

31:24.260 --> 31:25.800
在她离开美国之前
That that money is safely overseas

31:25.800 --> 31:28.380
那些钱在海外账户是安全的
Before she leaves the U.S.

31:28.380 --> 31:30.420
我们找到那些钱
We find the money,

31:30.420 --> 31:31.600
我们就找到了我母亲
We find my mother.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.300
通常国际电汇的结算
Normally it takes three business days

31:34.310 --> 31:35.970
需要三个工作日
For an international wire transfer to clear,

31:35.970 --> 31:40.890
除非是一家美联储授权的银行
Unless the bank is a Federal Reserve Signatory, in which case

31:40.900 --> 31:42.310
那样的话转账会立即生效
The transfer is immediate.

31:42.310 --> 31:43.900
你觉得她会亲自去银行吗
You think she'll head to the bank?

31:43.900 --> 31:46.230
她只要从买家已经从海外转账过来的
All she has to do is withdraw a few grand from the millions

31:46.230 --> 31:50.420
上百万美元里面取出几千块
That that buyer has probably transferred overseas already.

31:50.570 --> 31:52.240
她就知道了钱全到账了
She'll know it's all there.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.160
那么只要我们找到一家美联储授权的
So let's find a Federal Reserve Signatory bank in Miami.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.610
迈阿密银行  我们就有机会找到她
We'll have a shot at finding her.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.380
还有锡拉
And Scylla.

31:58.380 --> 31:59.880
你瞧  迈克尔  这就是
There, Michael, you see, that's

31:59.880 --> 32:03.280
为什么我刚才没有把你的名字放在碗里
Why I didn't put your name in the bowl.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.140
你是这里唯一无法取代的人
You're the only one here that's irreplaceable.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.850
探员  线人  打手
Agents, informants, muscle--

32:06.850 --> 32:08.620
他们都可胜任  但是...
They're nice to have, but...

32:08.620 --> 32:09.810
他们都是可以取代的
Finally they're replaceable.

32:09.810 --> 32:12.590
附近有家支行  大概20分钟的路程
There's a branch about 20 minutes away.

32:12.590 --> 32:14.230
你的头脑
That mind of yours--

32:14.230 --> 32:16.430
简直是百万里挑一的
It's one in a million.

32:16.430 --> 32:18.630
很高兴看到它终于为我所用了
Nice to see it finally working for me.

32:18.630 --> 32:20.600
我不是为你干的
I do not work for you.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.940
走着瞧
Not yet.

32:39.010 --> 32:40.340
是合法的
It's legitimate,

32:40.350 --> 32:42.350
我向你保证
I assure you.

32:42.350 --> 32:44.430
好的
Oh, okay.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.830
我想取回10000美元现金
I just want to withdraw the $10,000

32:46.830 --> 32:50.720
以确定卢森堡账户是否已准确无误地建好
So I can be sure the Luxembourg account is properly set up.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.470
当然
Of course.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.410
她在里面吗
Is she in there?

33:12.410 --> 33:14.080
是  我从窗子那看见她
Yeah, I saw her through the window.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.380
正和一个高个的黑发男子说话
She's talking to a tall, dark-haired guy.

33:16.380 --> 33:18.700
他们就是在酒店里面陷害我们的人
They're the same guys who set us up at the hotel.

33:18.700 --> 33:20.310
我们等她出来  杀他们个措手不及
We wait until she comes out, just jump them.

33:20.310 --> 33:23.300
那么  我们怎么对付她的保镖呢
So... What do we do about her security?

33:23.300 --> 33:26.010
要想对付她  得先搞定她的保镖
I mean, we jump her, we gotta jump the guys she's with,

33:26.010 --> 33:27.740
天知道  还会有多少探员会像蚂蚁一样
And God knows how many other agents are gonna come crawling

33:27.740 --> 33:29.700
从门外冲进来
Out of the woodwork like ants.

33:32.680 --> 33:36.270
听着  我不想说得这么直白
Look, um... I hate to bring up the obvious,

33:36.270 --> 33:39.100
但是我记得上次  你们俩依然对
But last time I checked, you two still disagreed

33:39.100 --> 33:43.370
锡拉到手后如何处置  各有打算
As to what to do with Scylla If we actually get it.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.030
是啊  我猜就是这样
Yeah, that's what I thought.

33:47.030 --> 33:48.360
别说这烂事了
Well, let's skip the damn thing.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.580
我是说  谁能拦住我们
I mean, who's gonna stop us?

33:49.580 --> 33:50.810
就凭一个17岁的小保安弟弟吗
A 17-year-old security guard?

33:50.810 --> 33:52.830
不是  可能是那个拿枪的家伙
No, probably the guy with the gun.

33:52.830 --> 33:56.140
他一看到我们的脸就会开火
He'll open fire as soon as he sees our faces.

33:57.260 --> 34:01.810
那么  或许可以不让他们看到我们的脸
Then, uh... maybe they shouldn't see our faces.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.460
然后送披萨的来了
So then the pizza guy showed up,

34:05.460 --> 34:07.130
然后韦恩从树丛里跳出来
And Wayne jumped out of the bushes

34:07.130 --> 34:08.880
想要把披萨抢过去  但是...
And tried to grab the pizza, but the...

34:08.880 --> 34:10.800
但是那个家伙...
But the guy...

34:10.800 --> 34:13.190
我的天啊
My god.

34:19.060 --> 34:20.730
你还好吗  先生
Are you okay, Mister?

34:22.110 --> 34:23.310
没事
Yeah.

34:23.310 --> 34:24.450
去打911
Go call 911.

34:24.450 --> 34:25.870
-快去  -别去
- Go, go. - No.

34:25.870 --> 34:27.900
别去  别打给任何人
No, don't call anyone.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.900
行吗
Okay?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.820
别打给任何人
Don't call anybody.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.740
别打给任何人
Don't call anyone.

34:37.830 --> 34:41.620
你知道吗  一旦那个弟弟拿到了
You know, once baby brother's got his little hands

34:41.620 --> 34:42.950
你的"魔法盒子"
On that magic box of yours,

34:42.950 --> 34:44.620
他要是想骗过马吉拉大猩猩[指代将军]
I don't think it's going to be too hard for him

34:44.620 --> 34:45.870
简直就是易如反掌
To trick Magilla Gorilla,

34:45.870 --> 34:47.170
你知道我是什么意思吧
If you know what I'm saying.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.260
不  我不知道
No, I don't.

34:49.260 --> 34:50.590
你还真以为
And you really think

34:50.590 --> 34:52.010
斯科菲尔德会不顾他侄子的安危
That Scofield's going to risk his nephew's life?

34:52.010 --> 34:54.010
他把"头等奖"交给"坏人"之前
He's gonna figure out something

34:54.010 --> 34:56.400
肯定会想出点别的坏点子来的
Before he hands first prize over to the bad guys.

34:56.400 --> 34:59.070
斯科菲尔德想得很单纯  就像童子军
Scofield thinks pure, like a little cub scout.

34:59.070 --> 35:02.050
布鲁斯  他的思维也很幼稚
Burrows, he just thinks like a cub.

35:02.050 --> 35:03.600
他说得对
He's right.

35:03.610 --> 35:05.270
斯科菲尔德在外面拿着我想要的东西
I don't feel comfortable having Scofield

35:05.270 --> 35:06.610
而我困在这却没有他的把柄
Out there with something I want

35:06.610 --> 35:08.940
我可不放心
While I'm stuck here with nothing he wants.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.610
我需要筹码
I need leverage.

35:10.610 --> 35:13.910
你看见他们刚过来的时候
You saw the way Mahone pulled Scofield over

35:13.920 --> 35:15.920
马宏把他拉到一边去了吧
When they first got here.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.250
我打赌他们说的肯定是关于
Bet you a wooden nickel they was talking

35:17.250 --> 35:20.670
女医生和她的藏身之处
About little Dr. Underpants and her whereabouts.

35:20.670 --> 35:22.840
但是我们不知道在什么地方
Too bad we don't know where that is.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.680
又错了  卷发小子
Wrong again, curly.

35:24.680 --> 35:27.180
你们都在这嚼口香糖的时候
While everyone was up here flapping their gums,

35:27.180 --> 35:29.550
我擅自跑去了马宏的车上
I took the liberty of toddling down to Mahone's car,

35:29.550 --> 35:33.320
查了他GPS上的最近输入的一个地址
Checking out the last address he put in his GPS.

35:34.890 --> 35:38.440
还有一线希望  找到你想要的筹码
There's a gambler's chance we might find the leverage

35:38.440 --> 35:40.610
就在这个地方
You're looking for right here.

35:40.610 --> 35:41.690
我去办
I'm on it.

35:41.690 --> 35:43.330
不
No.

35:46.810 --> 35:49.750
你想参与行动
You wanted to get in on the action,

35:49.750 --> 35:51.690
机会来了
Here's your chance.

35:56.390 --> 35:59.810
好的  我再帮您点一下
Okay, I'll just count this out for you.

35:59.810 --> 36:01.900
没这个必要
That won't be necessary.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.980
那好吧
All righty.

36:03.980 --> 36:06.480
这是您交易记录的打印凭条
Here's a printed record of your transaction,

36:06.480 --> 36:07.730
我想您的余额还有这么多
And I think a balance that high,

36:07.740 --> 36:10.820
您确定不想和我们的投资顾问谈一谈吗
Are you sure you don't want to talk to one of our investment specialists?

36:10.820 --> 36:12.870
不  谢谢
No, thank you.

36:14.610 --> 36:16.280
所有人  趴下
Everybody down on the ground!

36:16.280 --> 36:19.080
快点  都别动  没人会受伤
Now! Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.210
你  趴下
You, down.

36:22.170 --> 36:23.660
天啊  邪门了
Thanks. What are the odds?

36:26.250 --> 36:28.260
别
Don't.

36:36.130 --> 36:37.380
箱子
The case.

36:39.430 --> 36:42.220
我来拿
I'll take that.

36:48.310 --> 36:50.660
你好  老妈
Hi, mom.

37:01.790 --> 37:04.930
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯正从银行出来
Scofield and Burrows leaving the bank, now!

37:06.820 --> 37:07.810
快跑
Go!

37:21.230 --> 37:22.480
拿着锡拉快跑
Take Scylla and go!

37:22.480 --> 37:23.560
我们一起走
We gotta stay together!

37:23.560 --> 37:24.390
说了  快走
I said go!

37:24.400 --> 37:26.030
快
Come on!

37:56.540 --> 37:57.840
他好像没子弹了
I think he's out.

37:57.850 --> 37:58.880
上
Move in.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.350
上
Move in.

38:05.130 --> 38:08.770
美国司法系统一开始为无罪释放
How much eggs does the U.S. court system  have on its face

38:08.800 --> 38:11.010
林肯·布鲁斯  花了多大功夫呢
for exonerating Lincoln Burrows in the first place?

38:11.010 --> 38:12.910
功夫不到位  宝拉
An omelet's worth, Paula.

38:12.910 --> 38:15.300
你应该记得我从不赞成无罪释放
If you remember I was never in favor of the exoneration.

38:15.310 --> 38:18.430
林肯·布鲁斯是个给人卖命的暴徒
Lincoln Burrows is a thug for hire,

38:18.440 --> 38:19.840
他弟弟也不是省油的灯
And his little brother is no better.

38:19.840 --> 38:23.610
我惊讶于司法系统就这么忽略了警告
I'm amazed that the court system just glossed over the warning signs.

38:23.610 --> 38:25.980
-举个例子吧  -第一
- Such as?  - For one,

38:25.980 --> 38:28.480
他们绝不该把布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德搅和进来
They should've never let Burrows and Scofield in

38:28.490 --> 38:30.540
他们应该看看斯科菲尔德的过去
They should've looked at Scofield's past.

38:30.540 --> 38:33.290
显然他没有犯罪记录
It's clear that he had no criminal background.

38:33.290 --> 38:36.660
一个杰出的结构工程师干嘛去抢银行
Why would a brilliant structural engineer rob a bank?

38:36.660 --> 38:39.190
也许是要还清他的助学贷款
Maybe he needed to pay off his student loans.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.360
不是钱的原因
It wasn't about the money.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.920
你觉得司法系统
What do you think the judicial system

38:42.920 --> 38:45.170
会从这件事中学到什么
Is going to learn from all this?

38:45.170 --> 38:47.500
法院应该敲响警钟了
This has been a huge wake-up call for the courts.

38:47.500 --> 38:51.670
法官们要搞清楚他生活中的整个关系网
Judges will have to look all the relationships in his life...

39:19.840 --> 39:21.840
放松  小医生  放松
Easy now, doc, easy.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.840
只不过是你友好的邻居蒂博格
It's just your friendly, neighborhood T-Bag.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.310
我现在需要你的合作
Now I'm gonna need your cooperation.

39:39.520 --> 39:40.860
把你那双脏手拿开
Get your hands off me,

39:40.860 --> 39:42.090
婊子...
You son of a...

39:42.090 --> 39:44.780
托你男友的福  我就一只手
Not hands, thanks to your boyfriend.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.260
刚才说过了
Now, as I was saying before,

39:46.260 --> 39:48.560
我需要你的合作
I just need your cooperation.

39:58.070 --> 39:59.380
到这里来
Come in here.

40:07.050 --> 40:07.560
没事了
All right.

40:08.620 --> 40:10.450
没事了
All right.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.450
他太慢了
He's taking too long.

40:12.460 --> 40:14.460
出事了
Something's wrong.

40:14.460 --> 40:15.970
我们要回去找他
We gotta go back for him.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.500
他说他会赶上来的
He said he'd catch up.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.060
不对  出事了
No, something's wrong.

40:19.060 --> 40:20.980
打给他
Call him.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.100
打给他
Call him.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.740
迈克尔
Michael,

40:32.550 --> 40:34.020
我们现在得到它了
Now that we have this,

40:34.770 --> 40:36.830
要怎么处理它呢
What the hell are we going to do with it?

40:44.070 --> 40:45.390
他不接
He's not answering.

40:47.580 --> 40:48.420
林肯
Linc?

40:48.430 --> 40:52.090
我在广播里听说了银行抢劫事件
I heard about the bank robbery on the radio.

40:52.100 --> 40:55.680
你们兄弟俩可真喜欢上镜头啊
You boys just can't stand to be out of the news, can you?

40:55.680 --> 40:58.520
我猜你们拿到锡拉了吧
I assume you've got Scylla?

40:58.520 --> 41:00.020
快了
We're getting close.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.500
有消息会通知你
We'll keep you posted.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.810
如果我是你  现在不会挂电话  小子
I wouldn't hang up just yet if I were you, son.

41:06.610 --> 41:08.740
迈克尔  我们在公寓里
Michael, we're in the apartment.

41:10.700 --> 41:11.800
我知道它在你手上
I know you have it.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.980
不然  克里斯蒂娜也不会冒险公然火拼
Otherwise, Christina would never have risked a public shootout.

41:14.980 --> 41:18.370
现在 事情很简单
Now, I'm going to make this easy for you,

41:18.370 --> 41:19.870
把锡拉给我
Bring me Scylla,

41:19.870 --> 41:23.380
不然的话  莎拉这回就真的要上西天了
Or this time, Sara's death will not be faked.

41:30.710 --> 41:31.720
怎么回事
What is it?

41:33.750 --> 41:35.060
怎么回事
What is it?

41:37.970 --> 41:40.560
莎拉在将军手上
The General has Sarah.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.510
拿去吧
Take it.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.740
我发誓  如果你敢动她一根汗毛
I swear if you touch her...

41:56.740 --> 41:59.530
你好  儿子
Hello, son.

42:02.430 --> 42:04.570
我想你有件我想要的东西
I believe you have something I want.

42:04.570 --> 42:06.170
而我也有你想要的东西
And I have something you want--

42:06.170 --> 42:08.420
尽管我无法理解其中原因
Although I'll never really understand why.

42:08.420 --> 42:09.710
好吧
All right,

42:09.710 --> 42:12.010
也许我们能想出什么办法
Maybe we can work something out.

42:12.010 --> 42:17.050
我给过你机会想办法
I gave you the opportunity to work something out.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.430
是你拒绝了我  迈克尔
You rejected me, Michael.

42:19.430 --> 42:22.070
听着  我们见面谈吧
Look, let's meet and talk about this.

42:22.070 --> 42:23.070
没门  谈话的机会
No, the time for talking

42:23.070 --> 42:25.550
在你套上滑雪面具的那一刻就没有了
Passed about the time you put those ski masks on,

42:25.560 --> 42:26.340
不是吗
Don't you think?

42:26.340 --> 42:28.910
迈克尔  现在我要做的是
So, here's what I'm going to do, Michael.

42:29.830 --> 42:33.330
对林肯的右胸腔开枪
I'm going to shoot Lincoln through the right rib cage,

42:33.330 --> 42:36.700
子弹就擦过他右肺的下面
Just grazing the lower quadrant of his right lung.

42:36.700 --> 42:38.200
右肺会慢慢地衰竭
It will slowly collapse,

42:38.200 --> 42:40.670
呼吸会非常困难
Making it very difficult to breathe.

42:40.670 --> 42:43.670
如果5小时内  他不接受治疗
If he doesn't get medical attention, within five hours,

42:43.670 --> 42:45.170
就必死无疑
He'll be dead.

42:45.650 --> 42:49.380
克里斯蒂娜  妈妈  别
Christina... mom... please

42:54.870 --> 42:56.150
林肯
Linc!

42:58.690 --> 43:00.380
时间不多了  迈克尔
Second hand's spinning, Michael.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.690
看来你该做抉择了
Looks like you have a little decision to make.

43:03.690 --> 43:05.030
要锡拉
Scylla

43:05.030 --> 43:07.160
还是要你爱的人
Or someone you love.
