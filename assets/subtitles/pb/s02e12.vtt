00:03.160 --> 00:06.290
老兄  我们不如对半分了 来个双赢?
Listen, why don't I just give you half the money we call it a day?

00:06.300 --> 00:08.350
好吧 你六我四
All right, 60/40.

00:08.360 --> 00:12.150
你个窃贼王八蛋 你最好跪下祈求上帝
You thieving son of a bitch. You better get down on your knees

00:12.160 --> 00:13.550
不要让我找到你
and pray to god that I don't find you.

00:13.560 --> 00:18.750
要是让我找到你 我发毒誓扒你皮抽你筋
Because if I do, mark my words,I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

00:18.760 --> 00:19.750
- 贝利克先生?  - 什么事?
- Mr. Bellick? - Yeah?

00:19.760 --> 00:21.750
你介意我再问你几个问题吗?
Do you mind answering a few more questions?

00:21.760 --> 00:24.120
我们已经发现布伦斯兄弟
We have a lead as to where burroughs

00:24.130 --> 00:26.890
汇合地点的线索了 是一个他称之为"Bolshoi booze"的地方
will be meeting up with his brother. It's a place he referred to as "Bolshoi Booze".

00:26.900 --> 00:28.050
这是数字
They're numbers.

00:28.060 --> 00:32.590
把经纬坐标输入全球定位系统会发现那是新墨西哥州沙漠中的某处
Plug 'em into your GPS they'll take you to a spot in the New Mexico desert.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.390
爸爸!
- Daddy!

00:33.400 --> 00:36.120
宝贝  准备好出发了吗?
- Hey, baby, you ready to go?

00:36.130 --> 00:37.950
走  快走!
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:37.960 --> 00:42.560
我们接着怎么办?
What do we do now?

00:44.460 --> 00:45.590
她开口了吗?
- she told you anything?

00:45.600 --> 00:46.490
还没有
- Not yet.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.550
那就杀了她
- Then kill her.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.550
但是她知道些事情
- Well, she knows something.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.820
你敢抗命  你就完了!
You disobey me, you are done!

00:50.830 --> 00:52.290
干掉她  Paul!
Put her in the ground, Paul!

00:52.300 --> 00:53.920
只要你告诉我你父亲给了你什么
You're going to die, and all you had to do was

00:53.930 --> 00:56.990
我就放你条生路
tell me what your father gave you.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.530
去死吧
Go to hell.

01:03.630 --> 01:07.520
飞机会停靠在7英里路牌处
The plane's gonna stop at the seven-mile marker,

01:07.530 --> 01:08.990
第四大道  日落时分
route 4 at sunset.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.620
-我们必须出发了  -我带来个人
- We got to go. - I brought someone.

01:10.630 --> 01:12.950
爸爸?
Dad?

01:12.960 --> 01:15.260
我们以前遇到过
We met before.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.790
果然是你
It was you.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.390
别激动  儿子
Go easy, son.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.150
离我远点
Stay away from me.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.090
到底怎么回事?
- What the hell's going on?

01:27.100 --> 01:28.120
我认识他
- I know him.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.290
你说你认识他什么意思? 那根本不可能
What do you mean you know him? That's impossible.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.420
我认识他
I know him.

01:30.430 --> 01:33.660
我了解这个人!
I know this man!

01:40.400 --> 01:41.720
迈克尔...
- Michael...

01:41.730 --> 01:42.620
这就够了
- Maybe that's far enough.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.390
这与你无关
this doesn't concern you.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.700
爸爸  究竟怎么回事?
What the hell's going on, dad?

01:52.100 --> 01:55.120
妈妈死后...
After mom died...

01:55.130 --> 01:58.390
你在少管所
you were in juvie.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.250
他们把我扔给了这个...
They put me with this...

02:00.260 --> 02:02.020
这个养父照管
this foster father

02:02.030 --> 02:05.050
在珀欣大街的家中
down on Pershing avenue.

02:05.060 --> 02:09.290
他打骂我
He punished me,

02:09.300 --> 02:11.420
把我锁起来
locked me up.

02:11.430 --> 02:16.350
如果有人被如此长久地单独关在黑暗之中
If you leave someone alone in the dark for that long,

02:16.360 --> 02:19.790
他的眼睛就会发生变化
their eyes start to adjust.

02:19.800 --> 02:23.750
不管多小的东西都能够看到
You start to see things, no matter how small,

02:23.760 --> 02:30.520
因为如果那些东西存在的话 它们可以帮上忙
because if they exist, they can help you.

02:30.530 --> 02:37.730
助你达成独自关在黑暗中... ...唯一想做的事情
help you do the only thing you want to do...when you're alone in the dark:

02:38.160 --> 02:42.060
逃出去
Get out.

03:10.060 --> 03:12.020
我用过你们见过的所有鱼饵
I've used just about every lure that you could use.

03:12.030 --> 03:14.920
很多种只有专家才能用好
Most of them, you need to be an expert to use.

03:14.930 --> 03:17.090
这款电动鱼饵与众不同
this moto lure's a little different.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.250
每个人 真的是所有人都能用它钓鱼
Everybody, I mean everybody, can fish with it.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.290
而且你还能钓到更大的鱼
And you're gonna catch bigger fish,

03:22.300 --> 03:23.550
钓到更多的鱼
you're gonna catch more fish.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.620
甚至在水草密集处也能起作用
it even works in weedy areas

03:25.630 --> 03:28.290
而通常一般的鱼饵就失灵了
where most top-water lures won't work.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.420
朋友们  看看这个吧
Take a look at this baby.

03:30.430 --> 03:32.050
这玩意看上去像极了小淡水鱼
this thing looks like a real minnow.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.850
这是个非常酷的鱼饵
this is one very cool bait.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.420
我还从未见过这么好的东西
I have never seen anything quite like this.

03:37.430 --> 03:40.290
即便你以前在电视直销上买过鱼饵
even if you've bought lures off of tv in the past

03:40.300 --> 03:41.120
最后失望而归
and been disappointed--

03:41.130 --> 03:42.690
请相信我  我非常清楚你的感受
and believe me, I know how you feel--

03:42.700 --> 03:44.490
对不起  老兄
- Sorry, man.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.420
我以为你出去了
I thought you'd left.

03:45.430 --> 03:46.490
不  我还在这儿
No, still here. Here I am.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.150
是这样的  有些客人
Yeah, it's just that a couple of guests are

03:48.160 --> 03:50.920
投诉你电视开得太响
complaining about the volume of your TV.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.490
对不起  我睡着了
Oh, sorry, I fell asleep.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.520
可能不小心按到遥控器
I must have hit the remote.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.120
我会解决的  谢谢  真对不起
I'll take care of it. Thanks.Sorry. Thanks.

03:57.130 --> 04:01.320
很好  那么请你现在就开轻点
Great.Um, so could you do that for me now, please,

04:01.330 --> 04:02.490
现在就解决掉?
so it's taken care of?

04:02.500 --> 04:07.260
-好的 -谢了
Yeah. Thanks.

04:15.830 --> 04:18.900
好了  开小了
taken care of .

04:19.900 --> 04:22.150
你浴室里没问题吧?
is, uh, everything okay in your bathroom?

04:22.160 --> 04:24.390
你说什么?
Excuse me?

04:24.400 --> 04:27.420
你的浴室  里面声音好大
Your bathroom. There's a noise coming from it.

04:27.430 --> 04:31.320
是啊  我女儿把洗澡视为一种嬉戏
Yeah, my daughter thinks bath time is playtime.

04:31.330 --> 04:34.420
我会清理好的  我保证  抱歉
I will clean it up. Scout's honor.Sorry.

04:34.430 --> 04:37.890
好吧  祝你愉快
All right. Have a nice day.

04:37.900 --> 04:41.300
你也是
Yeah, you, too.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.220
迈克尔  迈克尔  请等等  迈克尔
- Michael, - Michael? - Michael, please wait.

04:53.230 --> 04:54.520
他真的这么对你?
- He did this to you?

04:54.530 --> 04:57.750
迈克尔!  林肯!
- Michael! - Lincoln!

04:57.760 --> 05:01.320
他真的这么对你?
He did this to you?

05:01.330 --> 05:06.060
他真的这么对你?
He did this to you?

05:11.100 --> 05:13.620
你怎么可以这么做
How could you do that

05:13.630 --> 05:19.100
对一个活生生的人
to another human being with your own hands?

05:28.600 --> 05:33.260
没事了  你现在安全了
it's okay. You're safe now.

05:35.500 --> 05:40.360
他不会再伤害你了
He's not going to hurt you anymore.

05:46.830 --> 05:49.750
来吧
Come on.

05:49.760 --> 05:54.060
跟我来  不要往回看
Come with me and don't look back.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.890
迈克尔!
Michael!

06:04.900 --> 06:06.550
迈克尔!
Michael!

06:06.560 --> 06:10.300
迈克尔...
Michael...

06:16.300 --> 06:19.900
这一切都会过去的
it's gonna be all right.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.200
莎拉!
Sara!

09:13.030 --> 09:14.750
六个月
Six months

09:14.760 --> 09:17.550
我在那呆了整整六个月
Six months I was in that place.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.890
你那个时候在哪里?
Where were you?

09:19.900 --> 09:21.450
你知道多久了?
How long did you know?

09:21.460 --> 09:23.140
我尽全力最快找到你
I found you as soon as I could.

09:23.150 --> 09:24.690
州政府把你转来转去
The state kept moving you around.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.220
然后你又走了  对吗?
Then you went away again, right?

09:26.230 --> 09:28.920
难道你不知道 我这么离开你心有多痛吗?
You don't think it killed me to leave you like that?

09:28.930 --> 09:30.390
就这样离开
To leave in the first place?

09:30.400 --> 09:32.290
从一开始我就是那个问题的关键
Since the beginning, I was the problem.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.020
从第一天开始
Since day one.

09:34.030 --> 09:35.890
你的人生全是因为我而弄成这样
Your lives are what they are because of me.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.620
林肯告诉了我有关公司的事
Yes, Linc told me about the company.

09:37.630 --> 09:40.920
很明显  你是某种分析家 那就是你不惜放弃家庭而选择的工作
Apparently, you were some kind of analyst.That's the job you chose over your family.

09:40.930 --> 09:43.590
我以为我干的都是对的 我以为我是在保护你
I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was protecting you.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.450
爸爸  保护我什么?  防范谁?
From what, dad, from who?

09:45.460 --> 09:49.420
公司有对手! 我对公司非常重要
The company had enemies! I was important to the company.

09:49.430 --> 09:50.390
成了被对付的目标
I became a target.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.920
制约我的最简单的方法就是抓住你!
Easiest way to get to me would be to get to you!

09:52.930 --> 09:55.990
我一知道那有多腐败 我就马上离开了
I left as soon as I realized how corrupt it all was.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.690
- 他们是如何收买政府的... - 你任何时候都可以回来!
-How they were buying the government... - you could have come back at any time!

09:58.700 --> 10:00.050
不  我不能!
- No, I couldn't!

10:00.060 --> 10:05.320
迈克尔  是公司的运作 使我和你们面临这样大的风险
Michael, turning on the company put me and you at even greater risk.

10:05.330 --> 10:07.550
我必须远离是非之地
I had to stay away.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.720
我们曾是你的儿子
We were your sons.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.450
你现在还是  迈克尔
And you still are, Michael.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.190
我们可以收拾这残局
We can fix this.

10:14.200 --> 10:18.190
我回来了这样我们可以应对险境
I came back so that we could fix this.

10:18.200 --> 10:23.760
这冤案永远也不能被澄清
this can never be fixed.

10:25.200 --> 10:30.450
有卷录音带提供了我们所需要的一切
There's a tape.Gives us everything we need.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.820
林肯会被无罪释放
Linc will be set free

10:32.830 --> 10:34.020
如果我们找到录音带的话
if we find it.

10:34.030 --> 10:37.020
你不会相信他觉得那盘录音带在谁手里
You're not gonna believe who he thinks has it.

10:37.030 --> 10:39.350
谁?
Who?

10:39.360 --> 10:43.600
莎拉

10:45.460 --> 10:49.320
是的  身材瘦高  棕色头发  棕色眼睛

10:49.330 --> 10:50.890
她还严重受伤
She'd be pretty banged up.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.000
急诊室没有符合此描述的人
No one matching that description has been brought into the er.

10:59.900 --> 11:00.950
克里曼
Kellerman.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.850
没有关于沙拉的报告?
No report on Sara Tancredi?

11:02.860 --> 11:03.920
她死了
She's dead.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.450
我正在处理尸体
I'm dealing with the body right now.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.890
你该放心了  都结束了
You must be relieved that it's over.

11:08.900 --> 11:09.950

11:09.960 --> 11:11.090
是的  我要挂了
Yeah, I got to go.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.150
还有件事   我要确认
One more thing: Confirmation.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.890
我要你处理尸体前拍张照片给我
I need a photo of the body before disposal.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.420
你用手机拍  然后发给我  我好...
Uh, take one with your phone and send it to me and I'll...

11:19.430 --> 11:23.250
比尔  现在不是时候  好不好?
Bill not a good time right now, all right?

11:23.260 --> 11:28.750
保罗  深呼吸一下  然后去拍张照
Paul, take a breath, then take the picture.

11:28.760 --> 11:32.960
我等着
I'm waiting.

11:39.300 --> 11:44.050
"现在是非常危险的时候

11:44.060 --> 11:45.220
阿维德知道
"Now, Arvid knew that, "

11:45.230 --> 11:47.650
但是他仍然紧紧的抓住龙的绳索
but he held tightly onto the dragon's leash anyway,

11:47.660 --> 11:50.120
怪物拖着小男孩
"as the creature ran into the everdark forest,

11:50.130 --> 11:52.520
跑进了黑暗森林
pulling the young boy behind him."

11:52.530 --> 11:56.050
为什么他不放开绳索呢?
Why didn't he just let go of the leash?

11:56.060 --> 11:58.150
因为他爱他那只龙
Well, because he loved the dragon.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.190
如果你爱谁
Now, when you love someone,

12:00.200 --> 12:04.320
你会绝不会放弃他们
you'll do anything to hold onto them.

12:04.330 --> 12:06.950
会做任何事让他们安全和开心
Anything to keep them safe and happy.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.050
这就是为什么我们在一起露营吗?
Is that why we're camping?

12:09.060 --> 12:12.520
对  我们会永远在一起的
Yep. So we can all be together.

12:12.530 --> 12:17.330

12:27.160 --> 12:30.800
拿去吧
Here you go.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.950
现在都解决了  是吧?
Well, it's all working out, huh?

12:43.960 --> 12:48.760
别提了
Don't say that.

12:59.860 --> 13:04.150
此时此刻  在这里
You know, this moment, right here, right now,

13:04.160 --> 13:08.300
一切都是值得的

I love you, too.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.690

孩子都已经长大了
The kids are bigger now.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.620
对不起  我只是...
Sorry. I was just...

13:44.630 --> 13:48.590
等了太久  是会感到无聊的
getting bored out of your wits'cause you been waiting so long.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.450
我真的很抱歉让你久等
Really sorry about all this.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.720
我们以前这里杀人案不多
We don't get a whole bunch of homicides out here,

13:52.730 --> 13:54.790
现在可能凶手想把以前的补上吧
and, well, we're trying to play catch-up.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.930
请坐
Please, have a seat.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.990
你朋友的事我很遗憾
I'm real sorry about your friend.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.190
病态的世界
Sick world out there.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.450
你说的是真的吗?
Ain't that the truth?

14:06.460 --> 14:08.550
你们俩是一起到堪萨斯州的?
So you guys out here in kansas together?

14:08.560 --> 14:10.320
是的  没错
Yeah. That's right.

14:10.330 --> 14:11.990
来干什么?
Doing what?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.090
嗯...只是来观光
Well, you know, just seeing the sights.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.450
你们离开芝加哥到特比里来观光?
You left Chicago to see the sights in Tribune, Kansas?

14:16.460 --> 14:18.590
上次我说过了  一个人想去哪儿去哪儿
Last time I checked, a man could go where he wanted.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.190
贝利克先生...
Mr. Bellick...

14:20.200 --> 14:22.120
叫我布拉德
Brad.

14:22.130 --> 14:26.820
布拉德  其实我并不关心你们在这里做什么
Brad. I don't really care what you were doing out here.

14:26.830 --> 14:29.850
这只是个程序
We're both in law enforcement.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.850
我们得各闻一口臭屁啊
We can each sniff out a perp like a hot fart.

14:31.860 --> 14:34.450
原谅我的粗话
Pardon my french.

14:34.460 --> 14:37.120
你我都知道你并不是罪犯  所以...
we both know you're not a criminal, so...

14:37.130 --> 14:43.150
我不管你们两个小伙子在这里 是躲着你们的老婆在这里寻开心
I don't care if you boys were out here whoopin' it without your wives or...

14:43.160 --> 14:44.890
或者是"断背"
going brokeback.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.590
什么?  见鬼  不是
What? Hell, no.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.650
我的意思是 我不管你们在这里做什么
My point is, I don't care what you were doing.

14:50.660 --> 14:53.650
我只是要知道当时你们在哪里 还有遇到什么人
I just need to know where you were doing it and who you might have crossed paths with so

14:53.660 --> 14:58.700
然后我就能找到是谁杀死了格雷先生
I can find out who carved up Mr. Geary.

15:02.100 --> 15:06.320
我和加里找到一个福克斯河监狱逃犯的线索
Geary and I got a lead that one of the Fox River Eight

15:06.330 --> 15:08.190
就在这个镇
was in town.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.320
谁?
Which one?

15:10.330 --> 15:12.390
希欧多尔·巴格威尔
Theodore Bagwell.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.050
那个对未成年人犯罪的家伙?
The man who did all those horrible things to those teenagers?

15:14.060 --> 15:15.920
就是他
That's him.

15:15.930 --> 15:18.850
我们想抓住他拿到奖金但是我们没抓住他
We were going to bring him in for the reward money, but we couldn't get a handle on him.

15:18.860 --> 15:21.750
我和格雷意见不和  但是...
Geary and I split up, figured we didn't have a shot, but...

15:21.760 --> 15:24.520
-但是什么? -在这发生以后
but what? -Well, after what happened,

15:24.530 --> 15:28.620
我开始想加里可能遇到了帝博格
I'm starting to think maybe Geary ran into ol' Bagwell after all.

15:28.630 --> 15:32.850
在特比里镇?
Right here in tribune?

15:32.860 --> 15:35.090
布拉德  你觉得你能回答我几个问题
Now, Brad, do you think you could answer some questions

15:35.100 --> 15:38.450
帮助我们追踪到希欧多尔  博格威尔吗?
that might help us track Theodore Bagwell?

15:38.460 --> 15:40.120
我会很感激的
I'd be indebted.

15:40.130 --> 15:44.250
我会尽我所能帮你抓住那个狗娘养的
I'll do whatever I can to help you nail that son of a bitch.

15:44.260 --> 15:46.090
你认为录音带在莎拉那里?
You think Sara has this tape?

15:46.100 --> 15:49.690
不  政府这样认为
Government does.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.350
我昨天还见过她
I just saw her yesterday.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.790
她自己都不知道她有那东西
If she does have anything, she doesn't know.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.690
她现在在哪儿?
Well, where is she now?

15:55.700 --> 15:57.190
我不知道
I don't know.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.150
有什么办法可以联系到她?
Any way you can get in touch with her?

15:59.160 --> 16:01.750
买个手机  我打电话给他
We brought cell phones.I could call her.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.790
拜托  拜托  老兄
Please, please, please, bro,

16:03.800 --> 16:05.520
到巴拿马再打电话给她

16:05.530 --> 16:07.350
我们只有不到两个小时了
We got less than two hours.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.630
我要赶上飞机

16:29.200 --> 16:30.550
就在山后面
- It's over the ridge.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.520
把枪给我
- Give me that.

16:31.530 --> 16:34.490

她的背包  她的药在里面
Knapsack. Her medicine's in it.

18:30.010 --> 18:32.000
我不知道  我刚才抱起她就跑
I don't know, baby. I just grabbed her and ran.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.940
她需要吃药
She needs that medicine.

18:33.950 --> 18:35.000
两天不吃就不行
She can't go two days without it.

18:35.010 --> 18:36.570

18:45.080 --> 18:47.840
她的处方

18:47.850 --> 18:50.170
是个备份
It's a backup.

18:50.180 --> 18:51.770
保险起见我另外保留了一个
I keep an extra, in case.

18:51.780 --> 18:52.740
好的
Okay.

18:52.750 --> 18:55.200
好的
Okay.

18:55.210 --> 19:01.850
我们只要去药店买就行
so all we need to do is find a pharmacy.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.970
别担心
Don't worry.

19:05.980 --> 19:08.870
嘿   看起来我们要去兜一圈 小宝贝
Hey, looks like we're going on a ride, sweet pea.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.700
我们绑住了帝博格 他可能拿了加里的东西
Look, we nail Bagwell, he might still have some of Geary's things on him,

19:12.710 --> 19:15.200
比如背包  他有些私人物品在里面
like his backpack,which has his personal stuff in it.

19:15.210 --> 19:17.740
他妻子喜欢的东西
I know his wife would love to have it.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.170
如果我们找到博格威尔 你可以私下交给她
If we find Bagwell, you can give it to her personally.

19:20.180 --> 19:21.800
-谢谢 -这也是我仅仅能做的
Thanks. -It's the least I can do considering ho you're helping me out.

19:21.810 --> 19:26.570
因为你帮了我很多 虽然有人还在担心...
Though some of the guys on the force are concerned about...

19:26.580 --> 19:28.500
他们担心什么?
what are they concerned about?

19:28.510 --> 19:32.170
没什么 只是你知道
Nothing.But you know what?

19:32.180 --> 19:33.700
为什么你没有告诉我所有的事情?
Why don't you tell me what you know, we'll get Geary's effects back to his family,

19:33.710 --> 19:35.400
我们能抓住博格威尔  拿回加里的家庭财产
we'll track down Bagwell,

19:35.410 --> 19:39.700
我敢肯定所有人与此有关的人都会知道 你对我们的帮助十分宝贵
I'll make sure that everybody involved knows that your help was invaluable.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.770
我还是劝你说出大部分
I'll even recommend that you get most of,

19:41.780 --> 19:43.840
那笔悬赏金
if not all of, that reward money.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.840
那到底
What is it exactly

19:45.850 --> 19:50.370
警方的人在怀疑些什么?
that the guys
on the force were concerned about?

19:50.380 --> 19:53.570
他们有人认为 你头上的伤还有疑点
Well, some of them thought that you weren't being totally upfront about your head injury.

19:53.580 --> 19:56.940
我是说  实际上这的确有点反常
I mean, to be fair, it does seem a little off

19:56.950 --> 20:01.850
你会没看见从前面 袭击你正脑门儿的人
that you didn't see the guy who hit you smack-dab on the forehead.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.540
你厉害
You got me.

20:06.550 --> 20:08.840
盖瑞和我
Geary and me

20:08.850 --> 20:12.300
对于怎么去找到博格威尔起了点分歧
had a little dustup over how to go about finding Bagwell.

20:12.310 --> 20:14.770
然后我们动起手来  他打了我
It got physical, and he hit me.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.240
我们俩打架就好象兄弟间那种
The two of us, we fought like brothers.

20:17.250 --> 20:21.200
我不想到警察面前去告他一状
I didn't want to rat him out to the cops.

20:21.210 --> 20:25.000
打完后  我们分开了
After the fight, we split up.

20:25.010 --> 20:28.200
之后...
And then...

20:28.210 --> 20:32.500
你知道之后他发生了什么...
Well, you know what happened to him.

20:32.510 --> 20:35.100
我真希望当初我们没打架  你明白吗?
I just wish to hell we'd never fought, you know?

20:35.110 --> 20:37.800
也许他现在就还活着...
Maybe then he'd still be...

20:37.810 --> 20:42.880
布拉德  你不能这么责怪自己
Brad, you can't blame yourself.

20:44.650 --> 20:46.300
我们为什么不将悲痛化为力量
Why don't we refocus our energy on

20:46.310 --> 20:51.050
来找那个杀了你朋友的人?
finding the man who killed your friend?

20:51.980 --> 20:57.410
罗伊也一定这么想
That's what Roy would've wanted.

21:13.250 --> 21:17.040
好了吧  宝贝儿
All right, baby.

21:17.050 --> 21:19.000
有保险吗?

21:19.010 --> 21:21.270
没  我没有保险
Uh, no, I don't have insurance.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.300
你开消炎药不用保险?
You're paying for dexamethasone without insurance?

有医疗补贴补助什么的吗?
You got medicaid, medicare or something?

21:25.980 --> 21:28.770

21:43.550 --> 21:45.470
请问?
Excuse me?

21:45.480 --> 21:49.370

21:49.380 --> 21:54.150

22:01.780 --> 22:05.400

I have to go to the back to get change for $100.

22:09.210 --> 22:13.280

那就被抓吧
Then we'll be caught.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.470
我不会让你死的

22:32.480 --> 22:34.640
那就听我的
Then listen to me.

22:34.650 --> 22:37.940
去找莎拉 唐克雷蒂
You find Sara Tancredi.

22:37.950 --> 22:41.740
她能终结这一切
She can end this.

22:41.750 --> 22:46.010

It's up to you now.

22:54.380 --> 22:57.440

24:28.920 --> 24:31.570

24:58.410 --> 25:00.140
情况最惨的时候...
when things were at their worst...

25:00.150 --> 25:02.000

25:02.010 --> 25:05.040
我再也见不到阳光了
I'd never see the sun again.

25:05.050 --> 25:10.150

But he saved my life.

25:11.080 --> 25:16.750
我只希望他能把我们当作他生活的一部分
I just wish he could have let us be a part of his.

25:19.880 --> 25:23.280
是啊
Yeah.

25:30.550 --> 25:35.450
我会告诉他的  好的
I'll tell him.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.140
这是开给你的条件
Here's the deal.

25:39.150 --> 25:40.970
所有指控都被撤消并且政府

26:29.450 --> 26:30.640
别这样  你个狗娘...
Come on, you son of A...

26:30.650 --> 26:32.670
他们什么也没找到?
And they found nothing?

26:32.680 --> 26:35.370
好的谢了
Okay, thanks.

26:35.380 --> 26:37.340
你的直觉真强啊  布拉德
Well, your instincts are great, Brad,

26:37.350 --> 26:40.170
管区警察今天是派了人到郝兰德的家里去了
but the precinct actually sent a unit over to Hollander's house today.

26:40.180 --> 26:41.970
一个匿名报警电话声称有人闯入
An anonymous caller said they saw an intruder

26:41.980 --> 26:43.340
但里面没人
but no one was there.

26:43.350 --> 26:45.140
该死的
Damn it.

26:45.150 --> 26:47.040
如果你知道博格威尔和郝兰德的事
If you knew about Bagwell and Hollander,

26:47.050 --> 26:50.070
为什么你们不到那里去(找他)呢?
why didn't you just head over there yourself?

26:50.080 --> 26:52.800
我们找不到那地方
We couldn't find the house.

26:52.810 --> 26:54.600
是吗?
Really?

26:54.610 --> 26:58.310
电话簿里有啊
It's listed.

27:01.380 --> 27:06.210
失陪一下
excuse me.

27:11.050 --> 27:13.870
谢谢
Thank you.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.440
一切都好吗?
Everything okay?

27:16.450 --> 27:20.800
是啊一切都好
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

27:20.810 --> 27:23.240
布拉德  你曾经去过冯特洛利酒店吗?
Brad, have you ever been to the Fauntleroy hotel?

27:23.250 --> 27:25.340
-大概离这里15分钟的路 -从来没听说过
It's about 15 minutes from here.-Never heard of it.

27:25.350 --> 27:28.070
那就奇怪了  他们找到
Well, that's strange,'cause they found

27:28.080 --> 27:31.270
这张收据  就在盖伊的房间里
this receipt in Geary's hotel room.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.580
是用你的信用卡结的
It's from your credit card.

27:35.550 --> 27:39.710
我不知道怎么会跑那里去的
I don't know how that got there.

27:43.110 --> 27:46.000
我觉得你是在回避这个问题
I think you're being evasive.

27:46.010 --> 27:47.940
你应该跟我说实话  贝利克先生
You should tell me the truth, Mr.Bellick.

27:47.950 --> 27:51.240
怎么不叫我布拉德了?
What happened to "Brad"?

27:51.250 --> 27:53.370
大概7年前我办了第一起
About seven years ago, I got my first

27:53.380 --> 27:54.900
凶杀案--一个漂亮的女子
homicide case   a woman, pretty.

27:54.910 --> 27:56.100
被粗暴的袭击
She was brutally attacked.

27:56.110 --> 27:58.270
她那兽性的男友留着她等死
Animal boyfriend left her for dead,

27:58.280 --> 28:00.700
但她还有口气...勉强的
but she was still breathing... barely.

28:00.710 --> 28:03.900
她在她的手机上输入了
But she punched into her cell phone

28:03.910 --> 28:07.470
凶手的号码  结果她就帮我们破了案
the killer's number,so she solved the crime for us.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.770
当我们找到那收据的时候  布拉德
When we found the receipt, Brad,

28:09.780 --> 28:12.670
盖瑞的手  他的手指着你的名字
it was in Geary's hand, his finger pointing to your name.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.970
他用生前最后一点力气告诉我们你杀了他
With his last ounce of strength, he told us you killed him.

28:14.980 --> 28:16.270
好吧  听着
Okay, listen.

28:16.280 --> 28:19.000
盖瑞和我在郝兰德家里发现了博格威尔
Geary and I found Bagwell at Hollander's house.

28:19.010 --> 28:20.340
我们逼问了他
We roughed him up

28:20.350 --> 28:22.500
直到他告诉我们
till he told us

28:22.510 --> 28:24.800
他从犹它挖来的那500万的下落
here he'd hid the five million bucks we knew he dug up in utah.

28:24.810 --> 28:27.140
等我们找到那笔钱后格雷耍了我
When we found the money,Geary double-crossed me.

28:27.150 --> 28:29.470
他把我打晕并拿走了钱
He hit me in the head and took the cash.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.140
我和格雷的死没关系
I had nothing to do with Geary's death.

28:31.150 --> 28:32.270
你听见我说的了吗?
You hear what I'm saying?

28:32.280 --> 28:37.780
我才是受害者  不是那个狗娘养的!
I'm the victim here,not that son of a bitch!

28:45.650 --> 28:48.770
快点  快点  快点
Come on, come on, come on.

28:48.780 --> 28:52.650

28:55.010 --> 28:57.540

Hey, uh, could you hurry it up?

28:57.550 --> 29:02.250
已经晚了  我得快点回家
It's just it's getting really late-- I got to get home.

Did you? Where'd you walk from?

30:00.650 --> 30:03.400
有什么问题吗  警官?
Is there a problem, officer?

30:03.410 --> 30:06.800
除非是你自找问题  富兰克林太太
There's only a problem if you make one, Ms. Franklin.

30:06.810 --> 30:10.940
你打算告诉我们你丈夫在哪儿吗?

30:10.950 --> 30:13.340

我们也不知道...

是他们的手沾满了鲜血  还是我们的?
is the blood on their hands... or ours?

34:02.510 --> 34:05.600

38:13.150 --> 38:16.750

38:49.650 --> 38:50.570
我要走了

贝利克先生  现在由不得你来选择

你凭什么这么说  你有证据吗? 他把它落在口袋里了

他们手中的证据还不够
Any of those things on their own,

39:02.180 --> 39:03.200
还不至于给你定罪

39:03.210 --> 39:04.900
但是如果加上这个...

39:04.910 --> 39:07.470
