23:48.320 --> 23:50.080
我没有家庭
I don't have a family.

23:50.090 --> 23:52.910

You didn't think you were alone on this, did you?

26:08.790 --> 26:11.680
你只是个士兵

不不不  别这样  求你挂掉吧

你已经输掉最后一块筹码了  老弟
You just crapped out your last bargaining chip, pal.

29:53.100 --> 29:56.670
拜托!
Please!

30:40.400 --> 30:43.950
我要是你可不会这么做  亚历克斯
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Alex.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.690
闻到了吗?
You smell that?

30:46.700 --> 30:48.320
丙烷
It's propane.

30:48.330 --> 30:50.390
到处都是
It's filling the room.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.850
你一扣扳机
And if you pull that trigger,

30:52.860 --> 30:56.400
我们都会死
we both die.

31:10.760 --> 31:11.950
我会开枪的!
I'll do it!

31:11.960 --> 31:13.290
我会开枪的!
I'll do it!

31:13.300 --> 31:15.950
可能吧
Maybe.

31:15.960 --> 31:19.690
在那之前  我问你个问题
But before you do, let me ask you a question, Alex.

31:19.700 --> 31:22.690
你认为你还算是个好人
Do you think you're still one of the good guys

31:22.700 --> 31:24.620
在为正义而战吗?
fighting the good fight?

31:24.630 --> 31:26.450
因为我想我们都明白你已经越线了
Because I think we both know you've crossed over.

31:26.460 --> 31:29.790
你在错误的立场上追逐着错误的对象
You're on the wrong, side chasing the wrong guys.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.890
我哥是无辜的
My brother is innocent.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.290
他根本没杀过人
He never killed anyone.

31:33.300 --> 31:38.060
多谢你让我看清这一切
Oh, thanks for opening my eyes.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.420
行了 亚历克斯  开枪
Okay, Alex, shoot.

31:40.430 --> 31:41.890
我们都知道接下来的事
We both know what will happen.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.190
丙烷早晚会把我熏死  我开不开枪
The propane will kill me anyway,

31:44.200 --> 31:45.820
又有什么差别  我到觉得现在正是时候
what difference does it make? Might as well do it right now.

31:45.830 --> 31:48.560
言之有理
That's a good point.

31:52.630 --> 31:54.050
好了吧
there. There!

31:54.060 --> 31:56.390
这样就会给你点时间
That'll give you some time

31:56.400 --> 31:57.850
来思考下你正在做的事
to think about what you're doing.

31:57.860 --> 32:00.550
但首先给你句忠告  收手吧
But first, a word of advice: Stop.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.190
因为你追得再近
Because when you get close,

32:03.200 --> 32:07.230
到最后都是我赢
I will win every time.

32:07.700 --> 32:11.290
你真这么想?
You think?

32:11.300 --> 32:13.490
在笼子里的不是我
- I'm not the one in the cage.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.090
对  不是你
- No, you're not.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.250
你我之间有个很大的区别  迈克尔
There's one big difference between you and I, Michael.

32:18.260 --> 32:21.320
你也刚证明了这点
And you just proved it.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.320
你不杀人
You can't kill.

32:23.330 --> 32:25.750
而只有杀了我才能阻止我
And that's what it's gonna take to stop me.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.290
因为我不会象你这样有所保留
'Cause I don't have the same reservations.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.350
我也不能那样
I can't.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.350
所以要么就是现在在吉拉
So whether it's today in Gila

32:33.360 --> 32:35.990
或者是明日在阿儿布克亦或是2月后...
or tomorrow in Albuquerque or two months from now...

32:36.000 --> 32:39.120
在巴拿马
in Panama.

32:39.130 --> 32:42.760
我会抓到你的
I will get you.

32:47.730 --> 32:49.030
我没的选择
I don't have a choice.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.050
我争取了点时间
I bought us some time.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.950
你还好吗?  在流血呢
You okay? You're bleeding.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.990
没事  我们走吧
Yeah, let's go.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.700
系上安全带
Your seatbelt.

33:37.830 --> 33:39.990
这儿  804
Here.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.060
让开
Move.

34:00.730 --> 34:04.220
这恐怕是你见过的最美的东西了吧?
Ain't that the most beautiful thing you ever seen?

34:04.230 --> 34:06.220
全是钞票
All that green.

34:06.230 --> 34:09.020
这比大峡谷还壮观
It's prettier than the grand canyon.

34:09.030 --> 34:11.250
罗伊  这是历史性的一刻
You know, Roy, this is a monumental moment

34:11.260 --> 34:12.250
对我们两个来说
for both

34:12.260 --> 34:13.320
把包给我  贝利克
Hand over the bag, Bellick.

34:13.330 --> 34:15.520
把锤子放下  老太太
Put down the pounder, grandma.

34:15.530 --> 34:16.950
我不是在开玩笑
Hey, hey. I am not kidding around.

34:16.960 --> 34:20.030
你以为就凭你那软骨头...?
Well, you think your pansy ass...

34:32.600 --> 34:36.730
下次你去屎堆里掏吧
Next time, you pick through the crap.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.090

可丢弃的电话和几支牙刷
disposable phones, couple of toothbrushes.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.890
旅店怎么样了?
What about the motel?

35:10.900 --> 35:16.260
他们是按小时记费的不需要证件
They charge by the hour, so they didn't ask for id.

35:21.100 --> 35:22.390
你拿着钥匙吗?
- Do you have the keys?

35:22.400 --> 35:25.060
是的
- Yeah.

35:44.030 --> 35:45.050
抱歉我们不在家
Sorry, we're not home.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.320
在听到提示音后请留言
Leave a message at the beep

35:46.330 --> 35:47.390

Listen. This message is for Maricruz.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.990
我就在那里等你的电话
I was right there waiting for your call,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.520
但是有警察来了我不能接电话
but the cops showed up and I couldn't pick up the phone.

35:55.530 --> 35:57.650
我想这大概就是
I know probably that's the exact reason

35:57.660 --> 36:00.490
你不想和我在一起的原因
why you may not want to be with me.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.550
听我说
Listen to me.

36:02.560 --> 36:06.090

38:40.830 --> 38:42.420

38:42.430 --> 38:44.550
他在边境就会停下
