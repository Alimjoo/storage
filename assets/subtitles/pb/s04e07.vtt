《越狱》剧情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

00:02.560 --> 00:04.060
这些是踝部GPS监视器
These are GPS ankle monitors.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.300
大家都过来  每个人都戴上一个
Now,step up,take one and put it on.

00:06.360 --> 00:08.000
交换人质结束后
When the exchange is over,

00:08.060 --> 00:10.300
我和你要好好的算一下帐
you and I are gonna spend some quality time.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.660
这些不是释放文件
These aren't release papers.

00:11.730 --> 00:13.260
我尽了全力了
I did the best I could do.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.700
你只有签了名  我才能拿到罗兰的仪器
You need to sign those so I can collect Roland's device.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.200
你想让我放弃
You want me to give up the one thing

00:17.260 --> 00:19.330
我在这个小组中唯一存在的价值
that makes me valuable to the team.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.660
你清楚你入伙的时候  我们的君子协定
Hey,you knew the deal when you came onboard.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.060
你以为  你走错一步
Do you want to flush it down the toilet

00:22.130 --> 00:23.360
你还能拍拍屁股走人吗
because you made a bad move?

00:23.430 --> 00:26.730
这个人刚刚继承了10万美金的遗产
This man just came into a $100,000 inheritance.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.300
我不认识他
I don't recognize him.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.330
如果你见到他  可以给我们打个电话吗
If you do see him,would you please give us a call?

00:31.400 --> 00:33.000
你不在税务局工作
You don't work for the IRS?

00:33.060 --> 00:33.630
我不在
I don't.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.660
你为谁卖命
Who do you work for?

00:34.730 --> 00:36.760
现在  我只为我自己
As of now... myself.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.860
我是克兰兹将军的助手
I'm an associate of General Krantz.

00:38.930 --> 00:41.200
将军喜欢保留自己的隐私
The general,he likes his privacy.

00:46.460 --> 00:48.760
我开始就知道你不是个正经的销售员
I knew you were rotten from the beginning,

00:48.830 --> 00:50.530
我要你彻底交代清楚
so I want you to walk me through this

00:50.600 --> 00:53.560
如果你说不清楚  我就向当局报告
and if you can't,I'm gonna call the authorities.

00:53.630 --> 00:55.530
科尔·普发
Cole Pfeiffer.

00:58.700 --> 01:00.400
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

01:19.530 --> 01:21.130
上一次
The last time

01:21.200 --> 01:22.930
一个像你一样的小姑娘
a pretty little filly like yourself

01:23.000 --> 01:26.460
把我打晕还五花大绑在椅子上
knocked me senseless and tied me to a chair,

01:26.530 --> 01:28.060
我是付了钱给她的
I had to pay for it.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.400
这次你或许也可以故技重演啊
You still might.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.560
那本书是我一个最亲近的朋友
That book was a gift

01:33.630 --> 01:35.130
送给我的礼物
from a very dear friend of mine

01:35.200 --> 01:37.830
他很突然地就去世了
who left this realm all too soon.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.660
詹姆斯·惠斯勒只会给别人
The only thing that James Whistler ever gave anybody

01:40.730 --> 01:41.960
送去淋病
was the clap.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.130
你有30秒时间告诉我
You have 30 seconds to tell me something

01:49.200 --> 01:50.800
一些我不知道的事情
that I don't already know.

01:50.860 --> 01:54.960
我和詹姆斯·惠斯勒关在巴拿马的时候
I followed that book from Panama City,

01:55.030 --> 01:59.630
就一直留意这本书  根据书的内容
where James Whistler and I were co-incarcerated,

01:59.700 --> 02:01.560
我找到了一个在圣地亚哥车站的柜子
to a bus locker in San Diego.

02:01.630 --> 02:04.100
在里面有关于这栋公寓
Inside was information pertaining to this apartment...

02:05.630 --> 02:06.900
是锡拉
Scylla.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.100
怎么样
How about that?

02:08.160 --> 02:09.460
听起来很熟悉吧
That ring a bell,huh? Huh?

02:09.530 --> 02:12.430
你知道多少关于锡拉的事情
What do you know about Scylla?

02:12.500 --> 02:14.900
我只知道我是最关键的人物
I know I'm holding the keys,

02:14.960 --> 02:17.900
没有我  那本书
because without me,that bird book's

02:17.960 --> 02:21.200
连一点意义都没有
about as meaningful as a fart in a wind storm.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.530
我使用了惠斯勒的化名
I commandeered Whistler's alias.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.800
我混进了他工作的地方
I infiltrated his place of business

02:25.860 --> 02:29.060
因为那是揭开所有谜团的钥匙
because it's the gateway to the whole damn thing.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.400
地点在哪
Where's the location?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.600
你怎么着也得给我点好处甜头吧
What do you bring to the jamboree,darling,huh?

02:35.660 --> 02:37.060
除了蓝色的小上衣
Aside from those baby blues

02:37.130 --> 02:38.830
和一把刀
and a knife?

02:43.800 --> 02:45.630
这是我
This is me.

02:48.060 --> 02:48.900
这是锡拉
This is Scylla.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.960
这是你
This is you.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.330
我一定会得到锡拉
I am gonna get Scylla.

02:58.660 --> 03:01.000
区别只是那时你可能还活着
And it can either be with you...

03:02.160 --> 03:04.330
也可能已经死翘翘了
...or through you.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.500
所以  为什么你不能
So why don't you give me

03:08.560 --> 03:11.530
在我割下你的睾丸前
that informed decision right now,

03:11.600 --> 03:14.730
告诉我你考虑后的答案呢
before I spill your hillbilly guts all over the carpet?

03:16.230 --> 03:19.660
你别想和我耍花样
'Cause you're messing with the wrong bitch.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.930
我能为你做些什么呢
How may I be of service?

03:28.260 --> 03:29.960
真不敢相信
This is unbelievable.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.360
我们还在考虑怎么跟踪斯库得利
We were planning our move

03:31.430 --> 03:33.530
-他竟然包了整架飞机  -对
on Scuderi when he chartered the flight. Right.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.400
而且你不能先一步知道
And no chance you dragged your feet a little bit

03:35.460 --> 03:36.860
斯库得利包了整架飞机
waiting for Scuderi to charter the flight?

03:36.930 --> 03:38.530
对  我们故意晚了一步
Oh,yeah,we want to drag this out.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.460
地点不错  你觉得呢　林肯
Yeah,well,location's pretty convenient,wouldn't you say,Linc?

03:40.530 --> 03:42.300
既然斯库得利出城了
Uh,Scuderi splitting town

03:42.360 --> 03:44.100
那我们是不是可以休息一下了
kind of caught us a break,huh?

03:44.160 --> 03:45.730
你能不能让他闭嘴
Would you shut him up?

03:45.800 --> 03:47.300
别这样对我
No,no.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.300
我们不能就这样等他回来
SELF: We could just wait till he comes back.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.060
昂格里逊公司制造农业用化学物质
AgriSow makes farm chemicals.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.100
又不是军事基地
It's not Fort Knox.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.200
你敢打赌吗
You want to bet?

03:53.260 --> 03:54.930
他们的专利价值上亿
Their patents are worth billions.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.430
所以很多公司都对这些专利
Which is why companies tend to keep a very close eye

03:57.500 --> 03:58.760
非常关注
on those patents.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.400
我们在一个星期内
Yeah,we could breach their security,

04:00.460 --> 04:01.560
可以突破他们的保安系统  我们也可以
in a week,minimum. We could get

04:01.630 --> 04:03.300
在一个星期内进入他的房子
in the guy's house-- week,minimum.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.400
或者跟踪他12个小时
Or we could follow the guys for 12 hours out of town

04:05.460 --> 04:07.300
在午夜之前得到第五张卡  你觉得怎么样
and have card five by midnight. How's that sound?

04:07.360 --> 04:08.830
你们觉得这个主意如何
How does this sound?

04:08.900 --> 04:11.260
如果你们半夜之前回不来  全都给我蹲大狱
If you're not back by midnight you're going to jail.

04:11.330 --> 04:12.560
你以为我不知道
Yeah,don't I know it.

04:12.630 --> 04:14.630
我们出去谈谈
Let's talk outside.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.600
那我们该怎么打算呢
So what's the plan?

04:21.630 --> 04:23.060
我们去拉斯维加斯
We're going to Vegas.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.600
好极了
Oh,hell yes!

04:25.660 --> 04:27.100
我要霰弹枪
Yo,I call shotgun!

04:27.160 --> 04:28.330
你们谁有...
Huh? Who's got-- Hey.

04:36.030 --> 04:39.300
你想和我谈什么  赛尔夫探员
So what do you want to talk about,Agent Self?

04:39.360 --> 04:40.560
到现在 我已经参与了
I've been a part of hundreds

04:40.630 --> 04:42.360
不下于几百次的行动了
of operations during my career--

04:42.430 --> 04:43.730
我告诉你一件事
and I'll tell you one thing.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.700
我从来没有被人列为第一追杀目标
I never been on the top of someone else's hit list.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.460
-你什么意思  -我什么意思
What are you talking about? What am I talking about?

04:47.530 --> 04:48.960
如果这个叫怀特的公司杀手能找到我一次
If this Company hit man Wyatt

04:49.030 --> 04:50.960
那他下次突然出现在我车后面
can find me once,it's only a matter of time

04:51.030 --> 04:53.400
只不过是时间问题
until he creeps up in the back of my rearview mirror again.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.030
这不可能
Well,that's not true.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.660
如果他要干掉你
'Cause you'll never see him coming at all

04:56.730 --> 04:57.860
你不可能见他第二次
if he's coming after you. Yeah.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.660
这话挺安慰我的
That's comforting.

04:59.730 --> 05:00.830
你以为呢  我想你死吗
What do you think,I want that?

05:00.900 --> 05:02.860
你死了 我们都得回监狱
You're dead,we're all back in jail.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.460
你当特工的时间比我长
You were an agent longer than me.

05:05.530 --> 05:06.900
我现在该如何是好呢
What's my play here?

05:08.460 --> 05:10.230
我和你直说了吧  你把我留在看守所里
Let me get this straight. You turn your back

05:10.300 --> 05:11.730
现在你问我你该如何是好
on me and now you want to know my play

05:11.800 --> 05:13.430
那是你的错
That was your fault.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.430
你尽职尽责了吗?
What would you have done?

05:22.400 --> 05:25.330
我追踪的人都是强奸犯  杀人犯
I've tracked down rapists,killers,

05:25.400 --> 05:27.000
退役军人
even former military,

05:27.060 --> 05:30.000
但是一个结构工程师就把我搞定了
but a structural engineer from Illinois was able to get to me.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.030
你知道为什么吗
Want to know how?

05:31.100 --> 05:32.560
告诉我
Yeah,I want to know.

05:32.630 --> 05:34.360
他没有逃跑
He stopped running.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.260
他主动出击
He got aggressive.

05:37.330 --> 05:38.900
我反倒成了他游戏的玩偶
He took the game to me.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.260
你就该学学他的手段
That's your play.

05:41.660 --> 05:43.660
你只有背水一战这条路了
That's your only play.

05:51.930 --> 05:54.260
我不用提醒你  谋杀一个联邦探员
I shouldn't have to remind you that killing a federal agent

05:54.330 --> 05:58.930
是非常麻烦的  就算为了工作也是一样
is a complicated matter-- even in our line of work.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.960
也许  马宏只不过是
Perhaps Mahone is just

06:01.030 --> 06:03.100
冰山一角
the tip of the iceberg.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.830
我们一直在搜寻
We've been searching for the link between

06:04.900 --> 06:07.560
重型监狱　布伦斯和斯科菲尔德之间的联系
SuperMax and Burrows and Scofield.

06:07.630 --> 06:09.630
我相信我们已经找到联系了
I believe we found it.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.430
如果斯科菲尔德和布伦斯已和政府联手
If Scofield and Burrows are working with the government,

06:11.500 --> 06:13.130
我们惹上的麻烦可比一个
we've got a much bigger problem

06:13.200 --> 06:15.500
国土安全局的小探员更大了
than one bureaucrat at Homeland Security.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.400
但是  是那个小探员带的头
But it begins with that bureaucrat.

06:19.460 --> 06:23.500
如果当·赛尔夫是他们的头
And if Don Self is the head of the snake...

06:25.560 --> 06:27.530
让他看上去是死于意外
Make it look like an accident.

06:34.230 --> 06:36.400
顺便说一下  我的费用得翻一倍
My fee just doubled,by the way.

《越狱》第四季 第七集
Prison.Break.S04E07

07:13.160 --> 07:14.830
喂
Hello?

07:14.810 --> 07:16.110
是布拉德吗
Uh,hi,is this Brad?

07:16.170 --> 07:17.440
是的
Yeah.

07:17.910 --> 07:20.340
几天前  你来我办公室
Uh,you came by my office a couple of days ago

07:20.410 --> 07:22.570
找一个继承遗产的人
looking for a guy who had an inheritance coming to him.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.270
是的
Right.

07:24.340 --> 07:26.840
我知道他在哪
I know where he is.

07:29.140 --> 07:30.670
她先要两千
She wants two grand first.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.070
我中午和她见面
I'm meeting her at noon.

07:32.140 --> 07:33.440
但是下一张卡更重要  对吧
Okay,the next card's more important,right?

07:33.510 --> 07:35.370
我们先去维加斯  然后再解决蒂博格
So Vegas first,then we deal with T-Bag.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.470
闭嘴
Shut up!

07:36.540 --> 07:38.870
我留下来
I'll stay.

07:38.940 --> 07:41.070
好吧
All right.

07:43.110 --> 07:44.740
林肯  带着
Linc,take,uh,

07:44.810 --> 07:46.410
莎拉  苏克雷
Sara and Sucre...

07:47.370 --> 07:48.540
罗兰　去维加斯
...Roland to Vegas.

07:48.610 --> 07:50.240
我们留下来的
The rest of us...

07:51.470 --> 07:52.370
会解决蒂博格
...will handle T-Bag

07:54.770 --> 07:56.770
大家都听到了  我们上路吧
You heard the man,let's go.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.940
你得答应我一些事  好吗
...promise me something,would you?

08:06.010 --> 08:07.010
说
Yeah.

08:08.470 --> 08:10.910
你能帮我弄张俺媳妇滴照片吗
Can you get me Carrot Top's autograph?

08:10.970 --> 08:12.940
我只是觉得
'Cause I just think

08:13.010 --> 08:15.310
这样才能让我无怨无悔地放手去干
that would make this whole thing worthwhile.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.940
多加小心
Be safe.

08:24.310 --> 08:27.010
维加斯宝贝儿  我们来咯!
Ay,yo,Vegas,bitches!

08:31.240 --> 08:34.310
他应该得到线索了
He should have the info by now.

08:34.370 --> 08:37.970
贝里克怎么去了这么长时间
Okay,what the hell's taking Bellick so long?

08:40.740 --> 08:42.210
她想要更多的钱
BELLICK: She wants more money.

08:42.270 --> 08:43.470
多少钱
How much more?

08:43.540 --> 08:44.540
我不知道
I don't know.

08:44.610 --> 08:46.540
你得过来和她谈谈
You got to come talk to this chick.

08:54.510 --> 08:56.170
别动
Hold on,hold on.

08:59.510 --> 09:00.510
怎么了　贝里克
What's going on,Bellick?

09:01.510 --> 09:03.670
面对现实吧
Believe it.

09:03.740 --> 09:04.870
出什么事了 布拉德
What happened,Brad?

09:04.940 --> 09:06.970
对不起  我没看出来是个圈套
Sorry,guys,I walked right into it,too.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.810
没关系  动作快点
It's okay. Go. Go! Come on,now!

09:10.470 --> 09:12.370
你根本不清楚你在跟谁合作  伙计
You have no idea who you're working with,honey.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.210
只有一个了断的法子  蒂博格
There's only one way this can end,Bagwell.

09:14.270 --> 09:15.440
你能不能别搞那么多花样
Why don't we skip the theatrics

09:15.510 --> 09:17.010
直接告诉我们你想要什么
and you just tell us what you want.

09:18.340 --> 09:21.210
我非常愿意让你头上开花
I'd love to put a hole right in your head.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.740
没时间了
Time's up.

09:22.810 --> 09:24.370
他也是
Him,too.

09:27.710 --> 09:29.570
全部给我上车
Let's all get in the van.

09:31.310 --> 09:33.970
现在 全部给我上车
Let's all get in the van now.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.010
马宏  你也上去
You,too,Mahone.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.410
我还记得我们初识的那一天  小白脸
I remember the day we met,Pretty.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.910
你坐在长凳上
You were a scared little college boy

10:15.980 --> 10:17.940
好像一个胆小如鼠的文弱书生
sittin' up on those bleachers,

10:18.010 --> 10:20.440
试着不招惹麻烦
tryin' to keep your ass out of the game.

10:20.510 --> 10:22.640
现在再看看你
Now look at you.

10:22.710 --> 10:25.080
冷酷  无情
Cold. Hard.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.710
好像一朵需要
Like a dried up flower

10:26.780 --> 10:27.910
浇灌的花朵
wanting to get watered.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.380
告诉我你想要什么
Just tell me what you want.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.240
我想让你受尽折磨
I want to make you bleed.

10:32.310 --> 10:34.180
我想让我体内被封印多年的心魔
I want to release the sinner inside of me

10:34.240 --> 10:37.480
再一次苏醒
that got me incarcerated so many years ago.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.910
但是  这一次
But it seems

10:45.980 --> 10:47.980
你很走运  小白脸
you caught yourself a break,Pretty.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.640
我需要你
I need you.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.440
现在
Now...

10:51.510 --> 10:54.410
你要乖乖地和我合作
you gonna cooperate right quick or so help me

10:54.480 --> 10:56.610
否则  我会打到你站不起来
I'm gonna stomp you till you can't stand.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.980
看着这几页
The pages-- look at them.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.640
-看着像地图  是不是 -我不知道
Looks like some kind of map,right? I don't know.

11:03.710 --> 11:04.940
你不知道的话  不可能一直
You know enough to chase me down

11:05.010 --> 11:06.180
追着我到这里
looking for this.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.940
别对我撒谎  小白脸
Now don't lie to me,Pretty.

11:08.010 --> 11:10.140
不管书里有什么  都不是你和我能解决的问题
Whatever's in that book-- it is bigger than you and me.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.540
就和锡拉一样
What,like Scylla big?

11:12.610 --> 11:15.280
这不是游戏
This is not a game,Theodore.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.340
你得告诉我  你一直和谁联络
Now,you need to tell me who you've been talking to.

11:26.010 --> 11:29.670
我不需要听你的鬼话
I don't need to do a damn thing.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.310
这就是所谓枪杆子里出政权了
That's the benefit of being the man with the gun.

11:38.540 --> 11:40.140
你现在给我写下
You're going to write down everything

11:40.210 --> 11:42.740
你知道所有关于锡拉的事情
you already know about Scylla,

11:42.810 --> 11:46.920
还有所有你从书里看到东西
and everything you learn from that book...

11:49.310 --> 11:53.380
否则  我就让墙上
...or I'm going to paint these walls

11:53.440 --> 11:55.040
沾满你的脑浆
with your gray matter.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.680
开工了!
Get to work!

12:36.980 --> 12:39.780
[档案名: 康姆利集团]
The Comrie Group

12:48.010 --> 12:49.440
好的  我马上就到
All right. I'll be right there.

12:59.710 --> 13:00.810
赛尔夫
Self.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.240
自从联系后
Hey. Michael's position

13:02.310 --> 13:03.910
迈克的位置一直没变
hasn't changed since you called.

13:03.980 --> 13:04.740
我们怎么知道他没有....
How do we know he...?

13:04.810 --> 13:05.840
蒂博格是个神经病
Bagwell's a psychopath,

13:05.910 --> 13:07.040
但是他是有计划的
but he's a psychopath with a plan.

13:07.110 --> 13:08.580
很明显  他需要从迈克那里得到什么
He obviously needs something from Michael,

13:08.640 --> 13:09.810
只要迈克不给他
and as long as Michael doesn't give it to him,

13:09.880 --> 13:11.280
他就能活着
he'll keep breathing.

13:11.340 --> 13:13.440
好吧  我和你一起去
All right. I'm coming with you.

13:13.510 --> 13:15.410
不  不  我能搞定
No,no,no,no. I got it.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.140
计划不变
Stick to the plan.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.610
你会忘记玛丽克鲁兹吗
Will you forget about Maricruz?

13:35.680 --> 13:37.180
你认为她不知道
You think she didn't know

13:37.240 --> 13:38.510
她姐姐要把你供出去吗
her sister was trying to set you up,man?

13:38.580 --> 13:40.010
你最好在维加斯有所斩获  兄弟
You better get some ass in Vegas,bro.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.740
我们是来复制卡的
We're here to copy the card.

13:41.810 --> 13:43.580
然后就离开  明白吗
Then we leave. Got it?

13:47.910 --> 13:50.010
你得到迈克的消息了吗
Have you heard from Michael?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.210
没有  怎么了?
No. Why?

13:52.280 --> 13:54.510
没事  我要快点搞定这个任务
Nothing. I want this thing done.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.680
维加斯决不是久留之地
Vegas ain't my town.

13:56.740 --> 13:57.840
真是个傻子  是吧
What a fool,huh?

13:57.910 --> 14:00.640
怎么会有人不爱这个地方呢
How could anyone not love this place,right?

14:02.680 --> 14:04.680
看看这些画面  就在那
Check this out. Right there.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.280
那个亚洲人
The Asian guy.

14:06.340 --> 14:08.980
我好像在哪见过他
I know I've seen him someplace before.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.140
弄得怎么样了?
So what do you have for me?

14:35.210 --> 14:36.410
伽特是什么
So what's "GATE"?

14:36.480 --> 14:37.810
你说什么?
Excuse me?

14:37.880 --> 14:39.240
在那个盒子上写着呢
It's on that box.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.180
-你为什么想知道呢  -只是好奇
Why do you want to know? Just curious.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.010
假如我要告诉你
What if I was to tell you

14:46.080 --> 14:48.010
我认为你只是在拖延时间呢
I think you're just stalling?

14:48.080 --> 14:51.140
拖延时间  直到你可以想出一条妙计
Biding time till you can figure out some MacGyver way

14:51.210 --> 14:53.340
-离开这儿  是吧  -我告诉你  你在用枪
to get your ass out of here,huh? I'd say you've got that gun

14:53.410 --> 14:54.980
指着能够帮助你的人
pointed at the one person who can help you.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.210
所以何不停止浪费我的时间呢
So why don't you stop wasting my time?

15:06.580 --> 15:08.440
求求你  别让他伤害我
Please,don't let him!

15:09.510 --> 15:10.840
她怎么样啊?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.580
她怎么样  迈克?
How 'bout her,Michael?

15:12.640 --> 15:14.380
能给个我不必杀她的理由吗
Any reason why I shouldn't kill her?

15:16.610 --> 15:18.440
让我们测验一下吧
Let's do a test.

15:18.510 --> 15:20.540
不!
No!

15:23.640 --> 15:26.040
进展到什么程度了　迈克·斯科菲尔德?
How far gone is Michael Scofield?

15:26.110 --> 15:27.910
迈克  他想知道什么就告诉他吧
Michael,just tell him what he wants!

15:30.780 --> 15:33.610
进展到什么程度了  迈克·斯科菲尔德
How far gone is Michael Scofield?!

15:33.680 --> 15:35.910
求你了  别让他杀我  求你了
Please,don't let him. Please!

15:37.510 --> 15:39.040
迈克  你啥时候变了个人似的了?
When did it happen,Michael?

15:39.110 --> 15:40.610
求你了  别让他杀了我
Please,don't let him...

15:40.680 --> 15:43.410
你啥时候开始不关心伤害别人的事了啊?
When did you stop caring about hurting people,huh?

15:43.480 --> 15:45.040
福克斯河监狱?  还是索纳监狱?
Fox River? Sona?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.210
你要在子弹穿透她的脑袋时
You gonna keep dragging

15:47.280 --> 15:49.140
选择视而不见吗
your feet while I put a bullet in her brain?

15:49.210 --> 15:50.980
你为何不把枪放下
Why don't you put that gun down.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.640
帅哥  你开始动笔的时候我就会把枪放下了!
I'll put it down when you start writing down,Pretty!

15:55.780 --> 15:57.240
最后的机会  三
Last chance. Three!

15:57.310 --> 15:58.380
二  一
Two! One...

15:58.440 --> 15:59.740
我说  我说
All right! All right!

16:05.810 --> 16:09.080
这些纸  是要拼在一起的
The pages,they fit together.

16:09.140 --> 16:11.780
但是它不是个地图
But it's not a map.

16:12.810 --> 16:14.310
是一张设计图
It's a blueprint.

16:15.380 --> 16:16.680
什么设计图
For what?

16:38.510 --> 16:39.640
我们的朋友贝里克  戴着
Our friend,Bellick,is wearing

16:39.710 --> 16:41.440
一个政府发的脚踝监视器
a government-issued ankle monitor.

16:41.510 --> 16:44.010
我猜斯科菲尔德也有一个
My guess is that Scofield has one,too.

16:44.080 --> 16:47.710
我就知道那个贱人在拖延时间
I knew that son of a bitch was slow-walking me.

16:47.780 --> 16:49.710
任何时候  联邦官员都有可能
Any minute,federal agents could come

16:49.780 --> 16:52.210
破门而入
blasting through that door.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.710
那我们该怎么办?
So what do we do?

16:53.780 --> 16:57.140
我要你弄到那个监视器的生产资料和序列号
I need you to get the make and serial number of that monitor.

16:57.210 --> 16:58.780
放松一点  振作精神  戴茜小姐
Feel free to pitch in here,Miss Daisy.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.310
如果让斯科菲尔德知道我卷入其中就完了
If Scofield knows I'm involved,this is over.

17:01.380 --> 17:02.740
我们需要他的帮助
We need to keep him on point.

17:02.810 --> 17:04.480
现在  你出去把线索找出来
Now,get out there and get that information.

17:07.580 --> 17:09.710
那些特工怎么办
What about the agents?

17:09.780 --> 17:12.640
兵来将挡
Let 'em come.

17:39.740 --> 17:41.640
我们怎么知道他会出来赌博
How do we even know this guy's out gambling?

17:41.710 --> 17:44.280
那家伙有30万美元的信用额度  还有免费的客房
The guy's got $300,000 in credit and a comped room.

17:44.340 --> 17:45.540
他就在这里  继续找下去
He's here. Keep looking.

17:45.610 --> 17:47.040
莎拉
Hey,Sara.

17:47.110 --> 17:49.540
我知道现在不是谈这个话题的最佳时机
Hey,uh,I realize this might not be the best time for this,

17:49.610 --> 17:51.040
但迈克还没给我打过电话
but I still haven't heard from Michael.

17:51.110 --> 17:52.380
他们正在解决蒂博格吧
They must be dealing with T-Bag.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.580
-林肯  别这样  -什么
Lincoln,come on. What?

17:54.640 --> 17:56.240
维加斯不是你的地盘
Vegas just isn't your town?

17:56.310 --> 17:57.440
任何你告诉我的事
From everything I've heard about you,

17:57.510 --> 17:59.380
都可能极大地改变进程
that would be a pretty big change of pace.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.940
我也这么想
I guess so.

18:01.010 --> 18:03.540
林肯  告诉我好吗
Lincoln,please talk to me.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.510
迈克有和你说过妈妈的事情吗
Has Michael told you about Mom?

18:06.580 --> 18:07.910
没有
No.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.380
他们很像
They were much alike.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.980
有着同样的想法
They got the same mind.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.180
当妈妈变老的时候  她开始失去意识
As Mom got older,she started to lose it.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.040
我们后来才知道
We,uh,later found out

18:16.110 --> 18:18.580
这是脑瘤的征兆
it was a symptom of a brain tumor,hama...

18:18.640 --> 18:20.040
错构瘤
Hamartoma. Yeah.

18:20.110 --> 18:22.780
她小时候  经常流鼻血
As a kid,she got nosebleeds.

18:22.840 --> 18:23.910
后来不留鼻血了
They stopped.

18:23.980 --> 18:26.780
当她30岁的时候  又开始流了
In her 30s,they started up again.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.310
她后来死于动脉瘤
She later died of a brain aneurysm.

18:29.380 --> 18:31.410
你告诉我这些  是想让我知道
And you're telling me this,because Michael and his mother

18:31.480 --> 18:33.410
迈克和他妈妈有一样的症状  对吗
are similar in that way,too,right?

18:33.480 --> 18:36.810
他小时候也流鼻血的
He got nosebleeds as a kid.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.010
后来也不流了  但几天前
They stopped,and the last couple of days

18:39.080 --> 18:40.740
他又开始了
they started up again.

18:42.180 --> 18:44.140
你妈妈几岁时候过世的
How old was your mom when she passed away?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.580
31岁
Thirty-one.

18:46.980 --> 18:50.140
迈克刚刚31岁啊
Michael's just turned 31.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.640
我找到他了
I found him.

18:56.710 --> 18:58.240
盯着他
Keep an eye on him.

18:58.310 --> 19:01.010
好的
Okay.

20:15.510 --> 20:17.810
你是安德鲁·布劳纳吗
Andrew Blauner?

20:17.880 --> 20:20.110
恩  是的
Uh,yeah.

20:20.180 --> 20:22.480
有什么可以为您效劳的吗
Can I help you?

20:22.540 --> 20:24.980
希望可以
I hope so.

20:30.200 --> 20:34.170
我想知道你有没有男朋友或者室友之类的
Any boyfriends or roommates I should know about?

20:34.230 --> 20:36.000
没有
No.

20:38.230 --> 20:40.600
今天有预定外卖吗
Any deliveries scheduled for today?

20:40.670 --> 20:42.630
没有
No.

20:48.130 --> 20:50.070
我再给你一次
I'm giving you one more...

20:51.700 --> 20:54.900
这些都是什么啊
What is all this?

20:57.330 --> 20:59.330
你还好吗
You okay?

21:01.170 --> 21:03.370
他们让我别和你说话
They told me not to talk to you.

21:05.170 --> 21:08.000
他们?  他们是谁?
"They"? Who's they?

21:08.070 --> 21:10.030
这是惠斯勒的设计图
This is Whistler's blueprint.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.270
我们可以在这个建筑里找到锡拉
It's the building where we can find Scylla.

21:12.330 --> 21:15.670
换句话说就是在伽特公司里
In other words,it's GATE.

21:15.730 --> 21:18.300
锡拉在哪
Where's Scylla?

21:18.370 --> 21:21.100
我在看到楼之前不能确定
I can't be certain until I see the building itself,

21:21.170 --> 21:24.000
但是我确定就在办公室下面的某个地方
but I'm pretty sure it's somewhere down here,below this office.

21:24.070 --> 21:26.100
什么是锡拉
What is Scylla?

21:26.170 --> 21:27.870
是公司的小黑名单
It's The Company's little black book.

21:29.230 --> 21:31.000
我想你现在就带我去伽特公司
I want you to take me to GATE,now.

21:35.270 --> 21:38.800
因为你能从锡拉里嗅出钱的味道　是吧
Because you can smell that Scylla money,can't you?

21:38.870 --> 21:43.200
那就是你为什么参加的原因　就像我一样
That's what you're in it for,just like me.

21:45.030 --> 21:47.570
说出来
Say it.

21:47.630 --> 21:48.900
说吧
Come on.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.530
我想你说出来
I want you to say it.

21:54.870 --> 21:57.830
我加入是为了钱
I'm in it for the money.

22:00.330 --> 22:02.170
你看到了
You see?

22:03.800 --> 22:06.530
我们其实没什么区别
We ain't so different after all.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.600
说
Yes?

23:00.670 --> 23:02.670
当·赛尔夫不在家
Don Self is not at his house.

23:02.730 --> 23:04.700
看起来他跑路了
Looks like he cleared out.

23:04.770 --> 23:08.530
通知局里我们的手下还有洛城警方
Notify our people inside the Bureau and LAPD.

23:10.070 --> 23:12.670
我觉得他跑不了多远
I doubt that he could have gotten very far.

23:12.730 --> 23:14.330
长官
Sir?

23:14.400 --> 23:15.630
现在不行
Not now.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.870
当·赛尔夫要见你
Don Self is here to see you.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.570
提个醒  朋友　她性冷淡
Got to warn you,friend,she's cold.

23:44.730 --> 23:47.370
[数据卡存储空间已满  请清理或更换磁卡]

23:55.670 --> 23:57.830
祝你好运　伙计
Good luck,pal.

24:03.870 --> 24:06.030
盯着他
Stay with him.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.330
斯科菲尔德就在那里
Scofield's really getting somewhere in there.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.730
效率挺高的嘛
Man works fast.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.300
他说如果看不到我以前在哪工作的
Says he can't get any further

24:26.370 --> 24:28.400
就无法进展下去
without seeing my former place of employment.

24:28.470 --> 24:31.300
你把我们的绊脚石处理掉了吗
Did you take care of our little troll problem?

24:36.270 --> 24:38.200
想都别想对我干这种事
Don't even think about doing this to me.

24:38.270 --> 24:39.430
你可不能过河拆桥甩了我啊
My name's on the door.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.170
要不是我觉得你还有利用价值
If I didn't think you were valuable,

24:41.230 --> 24:43.230
你早就死翘翘了
you'd be dead already.

24:50.130 --> 24:52.770
这只是有点信息超载  伙计们
It's-It's just a little sensory overload,guys.

24:52.830 --> 24:54.430
只是卡上没有空间了
There just wasn't any room for the card.

24:54.500 --> 24:55.870
不错 因为如果我们把装置打开
Right. Because if we turn the device on

24:55.930 --> 24:58.870
它就把赌场里所有的卡上信息都收集来了
in the casino,it fills up on all the data from the slots.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.930
就像他们付账的时候
Like when they're about to pay out.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.200
-这绝对不是预料之中的　-是吗
Oh,it's completely unintentional. Really?

25:05.270 --> 25:07.730
是的　这不就是你造这玩意儿的初衷吗
Yeah. It's not why you built the damn thing in the first place?

25:07.800 --> 25:09.930
如果我们不需要你
If we didn't need you...

25:10.000 --> 25:13.430
可你们需要我　我们从长计议  好吗
But you do,so just take a brewski and chill,all right?

25:13.500 --> 25:15.930
我们要想个办法让斯库得利一个人待着
Okay,we need to figure out a way to get Scuderi alone.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.100
喂
Yeah.

25:20.170 --> 25:22.600
老男人在水池边出现了
The old man just showed up at the pool.

25:22.670 --> 25:24.400
从他穿着来看
From what he's wearing,there's no way

25:24.470 --> 25:26.000
他身上不可能有卡
he's got the card on him.

25:26.070 --> 25:27.230
跟着他
Stay with him.

25:28.670 --> 25:30.900
卡在他房里
Card's in his room.

25:37.930 --> 25:39.070
告诉我  唐纳德
Tell me,Donald,

25:39.130 --> 25:41.570
你臆想中我们碰头的这一刻会是怎样一番景象呢
how did you play this moment out in your head?

25:41.630 --> 25:44.270
你想到你自己会过来吗
Did you picture yourself coming in here,

25:44.330 --> 25:46.530
昂首挺胸  盛气凌人地
chest out,jaw squared,

25:46.600 --> 25:48.170
准备让我给你答案
ready to demand answers?

25:48.230 --> 25:51.600
你可曾在幻想中想过
Did you at any time in your fantasy

25:51.670 --> 25:54.130
你会这么紧张呢
imagine that you would be this nervous?

25:55.970 --> 25:58.100
老实说 我从前没想过
Honestly,I,uh... I didn't think much past

25:58.170 --> 25:59.600
把这些东西给你
giving you these.

26:05.170 --> 26:08.600
柏林　尼日利亚
Berlin. Nigeria.

26:08.670 --> 26:10.630
康姆利集团
The Comrie Group.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.730
怎么不把肯尼迪遇刺
Why not JFK

26:13.800 --> 26:15.830
和林德伯格绑架案也一块儿搞来?
and the Lindbergh baby while you're at it?

26:15.900 --> 26:17.000
孩子
Son,

26:17.070 --> 26:18.900
这些事情都已经调查完毕了
those matters have been fully vetted.

26:18.970 --> 26:20.300
都是些陈年往事了
They're relics.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.800
我跟这些一点关系都没有
I had nothing to do with them,and if

26:22.870 --> 26:24.830
如果这些是你调查我的原因
this is why you've been pulling data on me,

26:24.900 --> 26:26.600
我可以省你不少麻烦呢
I could have saved you a lot of trouble.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.200
好吧　这些记录
Okay. Well,these records

26:28.270 --> 26:30.200
和足以解释我调查你涉嫌参与这些事件原因
and a sealed letter explaining my investigation

26:30.270 --> 26:32.170
的这封密封的信
into your involvement with these matters

26:32.230 --> 26:34.770
已被送到了国内五位律师手中
was sent to five lawyers across the country.

26:34.830 --> 26:36.100
万一我遇到什么不测
If anything happens to me,

26:36.170 --> 26:39.570
万一我失踪了　或是最终横尸荒野了
if I go missing,anything,if I wind up dead,

26:39.630 --> 26:41.130
那封信就会被公开
that letter is to be unsealed...

26:41.200 --> 26:44.700
然后他们会发现和我有牵连的线索都是死胡同
And they will find cold trails that lead nowhere near me.

26:44.770 --> 26:45.870
没关系
It doesn't matter.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.000
如果调查你的政府探员
If a government agent

26:47.070 --> 26:49.200
被发现浮尸于
who was looking into you is found floating

26:49.270 --> 26:51.530
洛杉矶某条河里或者任何你计划的地方
in the L.A. River,or whatever else you have planned,

26:51.600 --> 26:53.600
将军　你也不会有好日子过
your life,General,will change dramatically.

26:53.670 --> 26:57.300
会有媒体的质疑报道和监视
There will be questions,media coverage and surveillance,

26:57.370 --> 26:59.830
你和公司所做得一切
and whatever you and the Company are trying to do next

26:59.900 --> 27:01.000
和你的小把戏
with your little Laos game,

27:01.070 --> 27:02.830
或者是你们计划的东西
or whatever else you have planned,

27:02.900 --> 27:05.700
都将暴露于众目睽睽之下
it'll be next to impossible with thousands of eyes on you.

27:05.770 --> 27:07.500
好吧　请离我远点
Okay? So back off of me.

27:08.530 --> 27:10.500
你不是
You are not

27:10.570 --> 27:14.030
第一个想企图扳倒我的人了
the first person to attempt something like this.

27:14.100 --> 27:17.500
大多数我习惯称同仁的
Most of the others I now fondly call my colleagues.

27:17.570 --> 27:19.730
都学着
They've learned to put

27:19.800 --> 27:22.800
转移自己的兴趣关注其他的事情
their determination and focus to better use,

27:22.870 --> 27:25.330
并得到了更好的补偿
and with far greater compensation.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.200
你看错人了
Wrong guy.

27:28.270 --> 27:30.570
走着瞧
We'll see.

27:30.930 --> 27:32.970
亲爱的怀特先生　鉴于不可预知的情况
"Dear Mr. White,due to unforeseen circumstances,

27:33.030 --> 27:36.100
我很遗憾地告知您　我不能再
"I regret to inform you that I will no longer be able

27:36.170 --> 27:37.400
为伽特公司效力了
"to perform services at GATE.

27:37.470 --> 27:38.970
我对您所提供的机会表示感谢
"I thank you for this opportunity.

27:39.030 --> 27:40.230
如果这让您陷入难堪的境地
"I'm deeply sorry

27:40.300 --> 27:42.300
为此我只能深表歉意
"if this places you in a difficult position.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.900
但我现在实在无能为力  自身难保了
"I have simply not been able to escape these circumstances.

27:44.970 --> 27:46.730
再次感谢您所提供的绝好机会
Thank you for the wonderful,enriching opportunity..."

27:46.800 --> 27:49.830
等等　等等　等等...
Blah,blah,blah,blah,blah.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.700
这样写像你的口气吗
Does it sound like you?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.900
像的
Yeah.

27:53.970 --> 27:55.330
好的
Good. Yeah.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.270
听我说
Look,

27:57.330 --> 28:00.070
我不知道你是谁
I don't even know who you are,okay?

28:00.130 --> 28:01.170
让我走吧
Just let me go...

28:01.230 --> 28:02.370
闭嘴
Shut up.

28:04.270 --> 28:06.230
你是不是想知道
And you wondered

28:06.300 --> 28:10.870
我是怎么成为东北区的销售冠军的
how I got to be the top salesman in the northeast region.

28:10.930 --> 28:12.200
对不起  行么
Sorry,okay?

28:14.500 --> 28:15.670
对不起
Sorry.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.230
以此为戒吧
Consider this a warning.

28:35.900 --> 28:37.330
老不死的蒂博格
Old Teddy Bagwell

28:37.400 --> 28:38.700
可能是库萨县的人渣
may be Coosa County trash,

28:38.770 --> 28:41.070
但是科尔·普发是个人才
but Cole Pfeiffer's a man of refinement.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.070
事实上  他是伽特公司的
One of the Gate Corporation's

28:43.230 --> 28:47.600
顶尖销售人才
tippy-top sellers,as a matter of fact.

28:48.570 --> 28:51.400
请进我的办公室
Step into my office.

28:54.930 --> 28:57.970
应该有一个8乘10大小的房间
Well,there should be a room-- eight by ten.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.270
惠斯勒所指的入口
Whistler's point of entry.

29:00.330 --> 29:01.470
那是壁橱
That's a closet.

29:02.770 --> 29:05.730
不是的
No,it's not.

29:16.030 --> 29:17.430
汤力水加柠檬
Tonic and lime,please.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.070
谢谢

29:21.270 --> 29:23.030
我简直是活在噩梦里
I'm in the middle of this nightmare.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.500
不知道你能不能帮帮我
I wonder if you could help me.

29:27.330 --> 29:31.170
这是我22岁的表妹的的单身派对
It's my 22-year-old cousin's bachelorette party.

29:31.230 --> 29:33.500
那有什么可为难的
That's hardly the salt mines.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.630
听我说
Wait for it.

29:34.630 --> 29:37.300
我们在玩寻宝游戏
There's a scavenger hunt,

29:37.370 --> 29:39.900
我们组派我去
and my team has tasked me

29:39.970 --> 29:42.870
拍一张胖老头住的高级套房的照片
with getting a photograph in a whale's suite.

29:42.930 --> 29:45.170
我像胖老头吗
I'm a whale?

29:45.270 --> 29:47.930
你有这么一个恐怖的保镖
With a very scary bodyguard

29:47.930 --> 29:50.500
戴这么高级的手表
and a very gorgeous watch.

29:50.570 --> 29:52.570
你想在我的房间照张相?
And you want to take a picture in my room?

29:52.570 --> 29:55.600
我知道这个请求实在冒昧唐突
And I realize it's a completely inappropriate request,

29:55.670 --> 29:58.100
但他们已经怨我太扫他们的兴了
but they're already calling me a wet blanket.

29:58.170 --> 29:59.200
抱歉
I'm sorry.

29:59.270 --> 30:01.800
我怕是爱莫能助了
I just can't help you.

30:02.270 --> 30:03.670
如果我请求你呢
What if I said "please"?

30:03.670 --> 30:05.930
我真的有点绝望了
I'm actually a little desperate.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.100
祝你好运

30:20.730 --> 30:21.870
不要往心里去
Don't take it personally.

30:21.930 --> 30:24.030
你不是他喜欢的类型
You're not his type.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.800
就在你坐下之前
Right before you sat down,

30:25.870 --> 30:29.630
他还问我是不是想去找乐子
he asked me if I liked to party.

30:31.030 --> 30:32.830
-绝对不行　-拜托了
-Absolutely not! No way! -Oh,come on.

30:32.900 --> 30:34.000
为了集体牺牲一下下嘛
Take one for the team.

30:34.070 --> 30:35.170
玛丽克鲁兹不会知道的
Maricruz will never know.

30:35.230 --> 30:36.500
我真想掐断他的脖子
I'm gonna snap his neck.

30:36.570 --> 30:37.440
到他房间　呆上两分钟就离开如何?
Get to his room,stay two minutes,then leave,all right?

30:37.450 --> 30:38.300
去他房里待上两分钟就走  行么
Get to his room,stay two minutes,then leave,all right?

30:38.370 --> 30:40.730
好好 　同时呢? 　在电梯里?
Yeah,yeah,and in the meantime,what? In the elevator?

30:40.800 --> 30:42.570
佯装你不是那种很随便的人　然后玩玩他
Just play hard to get,you know,and then let him nuzzle

30:42.630 --> 30:43.430
让他嗯啊嗯啊...
a little bit. Whoa,whoa...!

30:43.500 --> 30:45.500
嘿　我们还能有什么选择?
Hey,whoa! What option we got?

30:45.570 --> 30:46.600
说啊　我们还能有什么选择?
Come on,man. What option we got?

30:46.670 --> 30:48.630
你倒是说一个出来啊
Give me one.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.670
你不能　给你
You can't. Here.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.830
继续　后面没什么
Go ahead. There's nothing back there.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.630
了解
I know.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.830
有什么锋利点的东西么?
Do we have anything sharp?

31:40.900 --> 31:44.030
你听说锡拉值多少?
So,what are you hearing,uh,Scylla is worth,huh?

31:46.270 --> 31:47.870
我听说
Me,I'm hearing

31:47.930 --> 31:49.200
值上百万
millions.

31:52.230 --> 31:54.800
别人怎么告诉的你来着
Is that a rough ballpark

31:54.870 --> 31:57.470
大约是个什么价钱?
in terms of what you,uh... what you've been told?

32:15.530 --> 32:17.630
瞧我们发现什么了?
What do we have here?

32:19.570 --> 32:21.530
你最好退后
You'd better back up.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
你　我　还有一个黑洞
You and me and a dark hole.

32:57.270 --> 33:03.070
老规矩　小白脸  你走先
Just like old times,Pretty,you first.

33:58.090 --> 33:59.990
今天在赌场手气咋样呀?
How are the chips falling for you?

34:01.690 --> 34:04.290
最后一块钱也买啤酒了
Spent my last buck on the beer.

34:04.860 --> 34:08.660
在赌城破产了你该怎么办呢?
What are the options when you're broke in Vegas?

34:10.730 --> 34:14.390
我想我得想点生财之道了  你说呢
I guess I got to work that out,huh?

34:15.930 --> 34:18.430
假如你不必再为生计发愁呢?
What if you didn't have to?

34:18.490 --> 34:20.730
以我的财力  或许可以
I may have a little business

34:20.730 --> 34:22.030
给你指一条明路
to throw your way.

34:23.430 --> 34:25.430
什么样的明路?
What kind?

34:30.230 --> 34:32.490
很快活逍遥的那种...
The easy kind...

34:32.560 --> 34:35.690
轻轻松松我就付你1000美元
with a $1,000 payout.

34:36.660 --> 34:38.730
你的法国白兰地呢?
What's your cognac?

34:39.790 --> 34:41.560
我从没拥有过
I've never had it.

34:41.630 --> 34:45.360
我套房里有瓶200年陈的
I've got a 200-year-old bottle in my suite.

34:45.430 --> 34:46.890
一起吧
Join me.

34:47.930 --> 34:49.730
这是你我两人世界中
This is private business.

34:50.790 --> 34:52.930
一次亲密的交易
Between men.

35:07.460 --> 35:09.060
他们就来了
They're on their way up.

35:09.130 --> 35:10.560
准备
Get ready.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.290
我爱死它了　猛男
I love it-- Mr. Macho Man.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.130
接下来呢
What's next?

35:26.190 --> 35:28.930
我不知道　你怎么不自己去搞明白呢
I don't know,why don't you figure it out?

35:28.930 --> 35:30.430
你我合作  到此为止
I'm done helping you.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.860
貌似有些人陷入了
Sounds like someone's caught

35:33.930 --> 35:36.160
消极怠工的状态里了
in the old captivity of negativity.

35:36.230 --> 35:38.460
还是我来给你的脑袋瓜子提提神吧
Let's get you in a more affirmative mindset.

35:38.530 --> 35:39.790
下一步该怎么办
What's next?

35:41.260 --> 35:43.190
我要把你锁这屋里
I think I'm gonna lock you in this room.

35:44.530 --> 35:45.660
然后你就被捕了
And then,you're gonna be arrested

35:45.730 --> 35:47.790
关回到福克斯河监狱
and taken back to Fox River.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.130
你怎么计划...
Just how do you plan on...

36:01.530 --> 36:04.230
你们根本不清楚自己在做什么蠢事!
y'all have no idea what you're doing.

36:04.290 --> 36:06.160
斯科菲尔德  没有我你成不了事的
Scofield,you can't do this without me.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.530
赛尔夫马上到
Self's on his way.

36:07.590 --> 36:08.690
记住我的话!

36:08.760 --> 36:10.360
我收到了你留下的暗号
Got your message.

36:10.430 --> 36:13.030
你们根本不清楚自己在做什么蠢事!
Y'all have no idea what you're doing!

36:14.090 --> 36:15.830
谢谢　阿历克斯
Thanks,Alex.

36:20.830 --> 36:21.990
伟大的城市
Great city.

36:23.630 --> 36:25.690
那就是维加斯的魅力所在
That's the thing about Vegas.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.430

40:22.300 --> 40:24.500
我们从未对你这么承诺过
No such thing was said to you.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.530
那玩意是干什么用的  是游戏主机的
What's that do? It's a battery pack

40:28.600 --> 40:29.930
一个电池组
for a video game console.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.660

40:48.000 --> 40:49.260
你说弄一个要几个月

40:56.560 --> 40:57.560
走吧

直到我们拿到锡拉  然后我就会让一些

41:35.530 --> 41:36.560
可是更重要的是
But more importantly,

41:36.630 --> 41:38.130
房间的楼下究竟有何玄机呢
what the hell is that room downstairs?

41:38.200 --> 41:39.560
那里没有他们可以藏那个
That's not where they keep the device

41:39.630 --> 41:40.730
能破译锡拉设备的地方 对不对
that decodes Scylla,is it?

41:40.800 --> 41:42.100
没有
No.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.100
那只是蒂博格自己认为有而已
That's just what T-Bag thought.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.800
通向锡拉之路只能从这个位置出发
The road to Scylla only begins down there.

41:46.860 --> 41:48.700
这里就是我们逮住蒂博格的房间
This is the room where we've got T-Bag now.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.700
只要翻过南墙
Just past the south wall,

41:50.760 --> 41:51.960
那里有个隧道入口  那个入口
there's an access tunnel that runs

41:52.030 --> 41:53.660

41:53.730 --> 41:55.460
穿过那里  我们就进去了
We get through that,we're in.

41:55.530 --> 41:56.800
那里就是我们能破译锡拉的所在了
That's where we can decode Scylla.

41:56.860 --> 41:58.130
还有这就是克兰兹将军办公室
And this is the building

41:58.200 --> 41:59.330
所在的那幢楼
where General Krantz's office is.

41:59.400 --> 42:00.560
-对头咯  -我今天才刚去过那里
-There you go. -I was there today,

42:00.630 --> 42:01.830
可是我得提醒你  那里的保全系统
but I have to tell you,the security

42:01.900 --> 42:02.930
很好很强大
in that place is unbelievable.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.060
根据设计图
According to the blueprint,

42:04.130 --> 42:06.260
建筑的底部结构是完全暴露的

42:06.330 --> 42:07.560
这用不了24小时
It shouldn't take more than 24 hours

42:07.630 --> 42:09.300
-就可以去到那里  -这只用花24小时吗
-to get in there. -It's only gonna take 24 hours?

42:09.360 --> 42:13.100
我们只要先把最后一张卡搞到手就行了
All we have to do is get that last card first.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.000
那么  基于目前我已经破译的部分
Well,based on what I've deciphered so far,

42:17.060 --> 42:19.230
我们需要随时可以进入伽特公司
we're gonna need around-the-clock access to GATE,

42:19.300 --> 42:20.530
现在就开始行动
starting immediately.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.460
如果你能帮我们弄到制服和证件的话
If you can get us some suits and IDs,

42:22.530 --> 42:24.130
我们可以像国税局审计员一样进去
we could go in there as IRS agents

42:24.200 --> 42:25.500
审查账目  我是指审查
auditing the books-- I mean,considering

42:25.560 --> 42:27.060
他们在进行何种不法勾当
the kind of racket they're running,

42:27.130 --> 42:28.900
瞒天过海  天衣无缝
nobody would have a problem believing that.

42:28.960 --> 42:30.460
你能做到吗
Can you make that happen?

42:30.530 --> 42:31.600
是的  我能做到
Yeah,I could do it.

42:39.230 --> 42:40.500
在垃圾桶下面
It's under the can.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.330
喂
Hello?

42:46.400 --> 42:47.930
我们是一条道上混的
We have a lot in common.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.300
是吗  你是谁
Yeah,who is this?

42:49.360 --> 42:52.130
另一个参与你们群雄逐鹿的利益集团
Just another interested party in what you're up to.

42:52.600 --> 42:53.800
是吗  你指什么
Yeah,what's that?

42:53.860 --> 42:55.060
锡拉
Scylla.

42:55.130 --> 42:56.600
打开那个信封
Open the envelope.

42:57.100 --> 42:59.130
[惠斯勒那本鸟类书的部分残页]

42:59.430 --> 43:02.160
我手头只有77页
The pages I've got only go up to 77.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.330
你想怎样
What do you want?

43:08.400 --> 43:09.660
我不知道你们都对蒂博格干了些什么
I don't know what you've done

43:09.730 --> 43:11.060
不过除非我亲眼看到他
with Bagwell,but unless I see him,

43:11.130 --> 43:12.700
否则你们就拿不到剩下的书页
you're not getting the rest of the pages.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.700
是吗
Is that right?

43:13.760 --> 43:15.300
把电话给我
Give me that.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.860
你是何方神圣?
Who is this?

43:17.730 --> 43:19.330
你好啊  迈克
