是他
It's him.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.270

12岁的时候得了癌症 我们不得不让她安息
But when she was 12,she got cancer,so we had to put her down.

02:03.290 --> 02:07.600
你可能会认为这是件很难下手的事情 但...
And you'd think it would be this big,dramatic event,but...

02:07.950 --> 02:10.200
其实过程非常的平静
it was very peaceful.

02:12.470 --> 02:14.770
一分钟前她还在呼吸 之后就停止了
One minute she was breathing,the next she wasn't.

02:27.710 --> 02:30.420
没事吧 需要我拨911急救电话吗
Everything okay? Need me to call 911?

02:30.420 --> 02:31.380
不 不 不用了
No,no,I got it.

引擎冒烟很厉害 看起来随时会爆炸
That engine's smoking pretty bad,looks like it could go up any second.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.180

-We'll be okay,actually.  -You think?

02:39.180 --> 02:40.690

我现在知道应该如何走精神病区下面的管道了

03:36.870 --> 03:39.540
就是说通向医务室的路线是没问题了
Which means our way to the Infirmary is clear.

03:40.060 --> 03:41.140
走这条新路线
With our new route,

03:42.190 --> 03:43.820
我们要到达这幢大楼的最远一端
we're gonna come up on the far end of that building.

03:43.940 --> 03:47.180
就是说我们得穿过30英尺长的走廊才能到达医生办公室
Which means we gotta walk down 30 feet of hallway to get to the doctor's office...

03:48.030 --> 03:49.030
也就是我们的出口
our exit point.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.070
整个计划还缺一个环节
Which means there's only one piece left to this whole thing.

03:55.220 --> 03:56.690
进那扇门的钥匙
The key to that room.

03:58.040 --> 03:58.470

03:58.580 --> 04:01.850
我们要做的只是造成另一起"意外"的碰撞和上次一样
That's all we gotta do is run a bump and grab on a CO like we did last time,

04:01.950 --> 04:04.030
拿到钥匙 复制一把
grab the keys,make a copy.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.660
没那么简单
It's not that easy.

04:06.140 --> 04:07.490
只有医疗队才有那钥匙
Only the medical staff have those keys.

04:08.050 --> 04:10.370
那你有什么招数么 美人儿
How're you fixing on getting it then pretty?

04:10.500 --> 04:11.300

这次不要再出意外了 好吗
No more surprises this time,right?

04:16.140 --> 04:17.100
好

04:19.180 --> 04:20.330

很惊讶你居然还在这儿
I'm surprised you're still here.

06:05.170 --> 06:06.300
我还以为你已经走了
I thought you'd be gone by now.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.460
中间出了些错
Well,we had a few setbacks.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.960
还计划着那事吗
Still planning on it?

06:14.680 --> 06:16.220
这取决于...
That depends...

06:17.870 --> 06:21.050
你是否还想跟我们一块儿走
How does the idea of escaping sit with the new you?

06:22.500 --> 06:27.730
那个曾经被关押的罪人他已经死了
Oh,the old sinner who was confined to these walls he's dead.

06:28.020 --> 06:31.720
新的灵魂理应得到自由
The new soul deserves to be free.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.670
以前的罪人会给我们准备一架飞机
Well,the old sinner was gonna have a jet ready for us.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.050
新的灵魂还能否办到
Is the new soul gonna be able to pull that off?

06:39.470 --> 06:43.640
诺亚拥有一只方舟 难道我没有
Noah had his Ark,didn't I?

06:50.070 --> 06:51.300
让我们祈祷吧
Let's pray.

06:59.180 --> 07:04.300
我要一把刀子 急需
I'm gonna need a blade.Pronto.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.160

-警卫呢  -两个死了 一个危在旦夕
-The officers?  -Two are dead,one is in critical.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.250
你知道被媒体知道这件事后 他们会怎么说吗
Do you realize what the media's gonna say when they get ahold of this?

07:17.730 --> 07:18.840
我们会把他抓回来 长官
We'll get him back,sir.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.850
这行干了40年 到头来确给他们留下这么个印象
40 years in corrections,and this is how they're gonna remember me.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.310
这是在凯恩郡 巴雷德警长是我的一个好朋友
This is Kane County.Sheriff Ballard's a good friend of mine.

07:24.420 --> 07:26.260
他还没跟任何人说过
He hasn't said a word to anyone yet.

07:26.350 --> 07:29.280
给我们4到5个小时 我们会把他抓回来的
Yeah,well...Give us four,five hours,we'll find him.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.330
如果我现在不向纠正部门报告 那么...
If I don't report this to the D.O.C.Right now...

07:36.330 --> 07:37.960
他们没必要知道
They don't have to know.

07:39.270 --> 07:41.500
你总是按章程办事 头儿
You've always been a by-the-book guy,boss,

07:41.560 --> 07:44.590
但这次 那些章程会炒了我们鱿鱼
but this time,the book's gonna get us all fired.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.190
找到他
Find him.

08:27.300 --> 08:30.330
这些是魁恩手机的所有电话纪录 打进的 打出的
The records of every phone call made to and from every contact in Quinn's cell phone.

08:30.580 --> 08:33.270
这就好比是大海 我们去哪里捞针呢
Well,we have our haystack. Any idea what the needle might look like?

08:33.400 --> 08:36.060
这里有几千个电话
There must be thousands of calls here.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.090
问题是打给谁的 打到哪里的
But to who? To where?

08:38.600 --> 08:41.760
知道吗 我们一辈子都查不完这些电话纪录
You know,it's gonna take us forever to go through all of these.

08:42.430 --> 08:44.700
万一这些和林肯还有斯蒂德曼的事毫无关系怎么办
And what if these have nothing to do with Lincoln and Steadman,huh?

08:44.930 --> 08:46.740
万一这纯粹是在浪费时间呢
What if we're just burning time?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.470
要改判死刑 我们总是差那么一步
We're just that much closer to the execution.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.730
你这是怎么了 尼克 我的意思是好像你想放弃了
What's going on with you,Nick? I mean,it's almost like you want to quit.

08:56.790 --> 08:58.140
我不想放弃
I don't want to quit.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.260
那就开始干活吧
Then let's get to it.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.140
唐克雷蒂医生马上就到
Dr.Tancredi will be right in.

09:19.230 --> 09:21.030

09:21.790 --> 09:23.800
你感觉...感觉怎么样
How're you feeling today?

09:24.890 --> 09:27.990
-好多了   -不错
-Better.  -Good.

09:32.150 --> 09:34.530
我们在塞奇桥的117号公路上
We got checkpoints up at 171 by Lemont,

09:34.710 --> 09:37.880
以及在通往罗密欧的河道边都设了关卡
at Sage Bridge and at the river going towards Romeoville.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.020
那边的目击者说
According to our witness over there

09:39.120 --> 09:43.110
嫌疑人驾驶的是一辆06年产的野马牌轿车 黑色或许是深蓝色
this new perp was driving an '06 Mustang,black,dark blue,maybe.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.370
这件事隐瞒不了多久的 布拉德
We're not gonna be able to sit on this thing very long,Brad.

This is me,Nate.I need this.

09:49.070 --> 09:50.020

You go back to Fox River.I'll be in constant contact.

09:53.420 --> 09:54.490
你介意我...
You mind if I...

10:04.910 --> 10:06.530
没事吧 先生
How're you doing,Mr...

10:08.470 --> 10:10.640
-我是罗伊·霍金斯  -你好
-Roy Hawkings.  -Hi.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.460
你去哪
Where are you going?

10:15.420 --> 10:16.990
我不得不先走了
I'd like to get going if I could.

10:17.130 --> 10:20.330
我在奥罗拉还有个会议快迟到了
I'm late for a meeting in Aurora.

10:20.350 --> 10:23.240
-你从哪来的   -芝加哥
-Where you coming from?  -Chicago.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.600
往这边走去奥罗拉是在绕远路啊
Kind of an indirect route to get to Aurora.

10:27.050 --> 10:28.360
我对这儿不熟
I'm not from around here.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.140
如果发现任何线索
If any of you get so much as a whiff of anything,

10:42.290 --> 10:44.020
马上通知我
I want to know about it immediately.

10:45.550 --> 10:47.250
也通知我 伙计
Makes two of us,pal.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.470
你想要什么 迈克尔
What do you want from me,Michael?

11:51.280 --> 11:53.490

12:02.180 --> 12:04.500
我要你为我做件事
I need you to do something for me.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.390
什么
What?

12:16.320 --> 12:17.580
等着我
Wait for me.

12:21.190 --> 12:23.060
我不会一辈子这个样子的
It won't always be like this.

12:25.490 --> 12:29.050
在这房间 这个地方
In this room,in this place.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.970
不到那个时候 我们不能这么做
Until then,I can't.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.290
不能这么做
We can't.

12:42.170 --> 12:43.390
该死的
Damn it.

12:44.910 --> 12:45.660
我不能这么做
I can't.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.910
我得走了
And I gotta go.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.850
-老婆 你来了  -艾弗卡托
-Hey,squirt. -Avocado.

13:17.970 --> 13:20.160
我得说多少次
How many times I gotta say it?

13:20.160 --> 13:21.950
你要叫得正式一点
You address me formal like.

13:22.180 --> 13:25.490
-博斯·约翰逊先生   -这样好多了
-Mr.Balls Johnson  -That's better.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.770
我想你和我可以解决点事儿
I think maybe you and I can work something out.

13:29.070 --> 13:29.820
是吗
Really?

13:30.150 --> 13:32.240
是的 听着 我外面有个朋友
Check it,I got this homie on the outside

13:32.370 --> 13:35.660
他可以每个月给你户头上存100块
and he can put a hundie into your commissary account each month.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.210
感谢你想得这么周到
It was nice of you to think of me like that,

13:39.440 --> 13:42.300
但你只有一样我要的
but you only got one thing I need.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.670
我要你帮我办点事儿 再来一次撞击偷窃
I need you to get something for me.Do your bump and swipe thing.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.660
-像上次偷表那样   -对
-Like I did with the watch?  -Exactly.

14:14.570 --> 14:18.370
上次给了我很多好处啊
Yeah,that did me a lot of good.

14:19.720 --> 14:23.260
警卫发现了 他们把我和艾弗卡托关一个房间
Guards found out and they stuck me into a cell with Avocado.

14:25.060 --> 14:30.490
所以如果你想要我偷东西 你也得为我做点事儿
So if you want something glommed,you need to do something for me.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.840
帮我杀了那家伙
Kill that son of a bitch.

14:43.270 --> 14:45.060
这不是我所能办到的
That's not something I can do.

14:48.260 --> 14:50.590
操他妈的霍纳斯·瓦格纳
Screw Honus Wagner.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.410
那是什么
What was that?

14:53.290 --> 14:55.190
我邻居的小孩儿
This kid in my neighborhood,

14:57.110 --> 14:59.510
他老爸专收集棒球卡...
his dad had a baseball card collection.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.690
所以我想...偷那些卡片
So I figured,you know,I'd swipe it.

15:06.630 --> 15:08.720
然后卖掉 去派对玩儿
I could get some party cash,you know?

15:10.620 --> 15:12.750
里面有一张卡片
And there was one card in there.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.270
是一张1910年的"霍纳斯·瓦格纳"棒球卡
A 1910 Honus Wagner.

15:19.840 --> 15:23.810
对我来说没什么用 我喜欢的是篮球
Doesn't mean nothing to me,you know.Hoops is my sport.

15:23.810 --> 15:28.800
这张卡片 价值30万美金
This card,it was worth $300,000.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.360
所以他们把我定为特大盗窃罪
So they slapped me with grand larceny.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.630
所以我才会来这儿的
That's why I'm here.

15:41.480 --> 15:45.400
所以我才会被判刑5年 最后搞得跟个臭娘们一样
That's why I'm sitting on a nickel getting turned out like a little bitch.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.100
一张棒球卡
A baseball card.

16:31.110 --> 16:31.930
爸爸
Dad?

16:41.600 --> 16:42.970
你在这做什么
What are you doing here?

16:43.490 --> 16:46.140
我接到他们让你见你儿子最后一面的通知
As soon as I heard they granted you a visit with your son,

16:46.740 --> 16:48.410
我就知道他们要对你动手了
I knew they'd make a move on you.

16:48.810 --> 16:50.340
我是问你在这儿做什么
I mean what are you doing here?

16:52.210 --> 16:54.520
距离这20英里外有辆车
I've got a car about 20 miles from here.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.640
我们去那边换车 然后
We'll switch out.After that,

16:57.770 --> 16:59.810
我会确保没人能找到你
gonna make sure you disappear.

17:02.010 --> 17:07.380
之后一切就是我和他们之间的事了 你可以走吗
Then this business will just be between me and them.Can you move?

17:07.530 --> 17:10.110
你在说什么 他们在追捕我 不是你
What are you talking about? They're after me,not you.

17:10.810 --> 17:13.110
相信我 事情没你想得这么简单
It's not as simple as that,trust me.

17:15.610 --> 17:16.950
我曾经为他们效力
I worked for them.

17:17.450 --> 17:20.250
你曾为他们效力? 你是个酒鬼  一个...
You worked for them?You're an alcoholic...

17:20.400 --> 17:23.260
你记得是这样吗 还是谁跟你这么说的
Is that what you remember or is that what you were told?

17:25.700 --> 17:27.380
你为什么要离开
Why'd you leave?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.890
我在一家跨国集团工作 我们把它称之为"公司"
I took a position with a group of multinationals we call The Company.

17:32.830 --> 17:35.060
他们决定了国家的每一次行动
They call every shot this country takes,

17:36.210 --> 17:40.540
通过法律 委派法官 决定是否进行战争等
what laws to pass,what judges to appoint,what wars to fight.

17:41.090 --> 17:43.770
关键是 如果谁想像我一样晋升职位
Thing is,if you wanted to rise in the ranks like I did,

17:44.090 --> 17:47.030
他们必须承诺放弃以前的一切
you had to commit to leaving everything you know behind.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.190
只有那样 你才有机会接触真正的信息
Because then you start to get access to the real information.

17:50.350 --> 17:53.900
而那些信息有些人甚至会不择手段去得到...
Information people would do a lot of things to get their hands on,

17:54.840 --> 17:56.420
比如牺牲你的家庭
like harm your family.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.000
你要我相信你
You expect me to believe that?

18:00.170 --> 18:01.590
你为什么不联系我们
Why didn't you reach out to us?

18:02.560 --> 18:03.770
你为什么不打电话给我们
Why didn't you call us?

18:03.890 --> 18:07.080
我每天都在忏悔 但我别无选择
I regretted it every day,but I didn't have a choice.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.250
林肯 我离开公司的那天
Lincoln,the day I left The Company,

18:11.790 --> 18:13.780
我带走了所有的信息
I took all that information with me.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.200
所以他们才对你动手
That's why they're doing this to you.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.090
所有的一切 都是为了阻止我
All of it,to stop me.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.420
你得相信我
You have to trust me.

18:23.830 --> 18:26.130
那你就得告诉我发生了什么事
Then you'll have to tell me what's going on.

18:27.330 --> 18:31.420
-我不能那么做   -那我也帮不了你
-I can't do that.  -Then I can't help.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.790
听着 我已经按你说的做了
Look,I did what you ask.

18:34.090 --> 18:36.180
绿卡换信用卡 这是说好了的
Green card for credit card,that was the deal.

18:36.650 --> 18:38.670
那我们再做一次交易
Then,we'll make a new deal.

18:39.060 --> 18:40.880
迈克尔 如果被谁发现的话...
Michael,if somebody find out...

18:41.010 --> 18:43.350
相信我 我比你的麻烦更大
Believe me,I'll be in more trouble than you will.

18:43.370 --> 18:47.620
我知道 所以我才不能帮你
I know,and this is why I won't help you.

18:47.630 --> 18:50.300
听着 尼卡 我向你保证
Look,Nika,I promise you...

18:50.430 --> 18:51.960
我不知道发生了什么事
Look,I don't know what's going on.

18:52.150 --> 18:53.750
我不知道你怎么会去监狱的
I don't know why you're in there,

18:54.100 --> 18:57.110
那些把我带到这儿来的人教我一件事
but if there's one thing those guys that brought me here taught me,

18:57.440 --> 19:00.380
如果你斗争 如果你反抗
is that if you fight,if you struggle,

19:00.510 --> 19:05.190
你只会把事搞得更糟 不要反抗了 迈克尔
you only make things worse.Stop fighting,Michael.

19:07.710 --> 19:09.220
再考虑一下 行吗
Just think about it,okay?

19:09.430 --> 19:10.430
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

19:22.030 --> 19:25.050
这里又有 这个406号码 每张单子上都有
There it is again,the 406 number.It's on every listing.

19:26.140 --> 19:27.560
4-0-6
406.

19:29.010 --> 19:32.700
有超过两百个商用电话 外加一百个家用电话
Yeah,there's over 200 businesses,another 100 residences

19:32.880 --> 19:34.720
分布在17个国家
in 171 different countries.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.220
他们都拨打这个电话
And they're all calling the same number.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.730
-4-0-6  -蒙大拿
-406.  -Montana.

19:39.130 --> 19:40.790
能查到号码前缀吗
Can you check the prefixes?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.090
这不合逻辑
This doesn't make sense.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.810
全世界的人都在打电话
All these people from all over the world

19:43.810 --> 19:47.320
给这个不知道在哪儿 只有42个人的地方
are calling this place in the middle of nowhere with a population of 42.

19:48.010 --> 19:49.780
布莱克福特 蒙大拿
Blackfoot,Montana.

20:06.850 --> 20:09.270
我还以为你会明白 特伦斯
I thought you understood,Terrence.

20:09.510 --> 20:13.040
如果你想和我谈话 我们在家 面对面谈
If you wanna talk,we set up a meeting,at home,in person.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.560
我看了最近的报导 你的人气有所下降
I saw the latest tracking.Your polls are headed south.

20:16.700 --> 20:21.060
也许布伦斯的案子终于吸引了一些议员们的注意力
Maybe the Burrows thing is finally starting to gain some traction with the swings.

20:22.290 --> 20:24.080
-真是打击  -再见 特伦斯
-It could hurt.  -Goodbye,Terrence.

20:24.270 --> 20:26.640
-你说过一切都快结束了  -是的
-You said it was almost over.  -It is.

20:26.850 --> 20:32.310
我们是在说林肯·布伦斯... 还是你的竞选
Are we talking about Lincoln Burrows ...or your candidacy?

20:32.480 --> 20:35.830
你现在还活着的唯一理由
The only reason that you are still alive

20:36.010 --> 20:38.320
是因为我不让他们杀你
is because I won't let them kill you.

20:38.450 --> 20:43.240
是 这我相当清楚
Yeah.I'm pretty clear on that.

20:43.730 --> 20:45.640
但我不太想得通的是...
But the thing I can't quite figure is,

20:45.740 --> 20:48.720
随着这件事搞得越来越黑...
with the crap storm this thing's become,

20:50.240 --> 20:52.290
他们怎么还没杀了你
why they haven't killed you?

21:38.210 --> 21:40.250
想好怎么去搞医务室钥匙了吗
Figure out how you're gonna get the key to the Infirmary yet?

21:42.600 --> 21:44.260
还没有
Not quite.

21:44.610 --> 21:46.670
你想对她下手还是怎么
You working a game on her,or what?

21:50.620 --> 21:52.520
我不知道
I don't know.

22:00.690 --> 22:02.770
我想了很多
I've had time to think.

22:04.810 --> 22:06.780
没想你要杀了我
Not that you tried to kill me,

22:06.940 --> 22:10.270
而是想上帝如何救了我
but about how Jesus saved me.

22:14.720 --> 22:18.720
我不是来这里报复的
I didn't come here,Theodore,to inflict any more pain.

22:20.430 --> 22:26.780
握住我的手 让我们尽弃前嫌吧
Take my hand so we can put this behind us. Please.

22:34.670 --> 22:37.040
把你的另一只手伸出来
Show me the palm of your other hand.

22:38.760 --> 22:43.340
别再侮辱我 在你干了那事以后
Don't insult me. After all that you've done,

22:44.410 --> 22:49.340
我只要求你 别再侮辱我
the least I ask is that you don't insult me.

23:11.810 --> 23:18.240
温暖的手不是比冰冷的刀片感觉更好么
Does not a warm hand feel better than a cold shank?

23:22.410 --> 23:25.810
你说得很好 约翰 是啊
You got a point there,John. Yeah.

23:28.580 --> 23:30.020
休战吧
Truce?

23:30.570 --> 23:33.560
行 休战
You got it. Truce.

23:49.100 --> 23:49.900
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.440
都已经过去两个半小时了那警长还什么消息都没有 
It's been two and a half hours and you're telling me that sheriff has got nothing?

23:53.580 --> 23:55.230
我是来告诉你道路已经全部被封锁了
I'm telling you the roads are blocked off.

23:55.340 --> 23:58.220
那野马车一定是在方圆10英里内的某个地方
That Mustang's got to be somewhere within those 10 square miles.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.850
好吧 听着 再给你两个小时的时间找他
All right,listen,you got two hours to find him.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.560
过后 我不得不向媒体宣布
After that,I have got to talk to the press.

24:04.700 --> 24:06.710
现在有个死刑犯正逃之夭夭
Hey,but there's an escaped killer outside our walls

24:06.820 --> 24:09.250
有些东西比你的职业更重要
and there are some things that are more important than career.

24:09.370 --> 24:10.550
现在给我去找到他
Now you find him!

24:14.430 --> 24:17.820
-长官  -我没时间
-Hey,Captain.  -I don't have time.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.830
他说他想和你谈谈
He says he really needs to talk.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.320
你有什么还是问我要什么
You have something for me or do you need something?

24:23.420 --> 24:25.290
因为如果是后者的话 你纯粹是在浪费时间
'Cause if it's the latter,you just wasted my time.

24:25.770 --> 24:28.050
我现在的狱友 艾弗卡托...
That cellie you stuck me with,Avocado...

24:28.270 --> 24:29.750
你有什么东西还是你需要什么东西
Do you have something or do you need something?

24:30.220 --> 24:31.460
我最后再问一次
Last time I'm gonna ask.

24:31.620 --> 24:34.770
我求你不要再把我和他关一起
I'm asking you to just,please,get me out of that cell.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.660
头儿 求你了 头儿
Boss,please.Boss!

24:39.910 --> 24:41.330
走吧
Let's go.

24:53.540 --> 24:57.270
你要学会放松 就不会太痛了
You need to start relaxing.It'll hurt a lot less.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.130
可以去你的床上做吗
Can we go on your bunk?

24:59.910 --> 25:01.110
当然可以了
Sure,squirt.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.940
让我把这弄得更舒服一点
Let me make it a wee bit more comfortable.

25:15.370 --> 25:16.920
既然说好了的话
Now we're talking.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.930
你是监狱的那个医生
Are you the doctor from the prison?

25:33.190 --> 25:34.950
是 我能帮你...
Yeah.Can,I...

25:35.110 --> 25:37.200
你认识一个叫迈克尔·斯科菲尔德的囚犯吗
Do you know a prisoner named Michael Scofield?

25:38.120 --> 25:38.920
我认识
I do.

25:42.450 --> 25:44.420
-你是他老婆 对吗  -我得和你谈谈
-You're his wife,right?  -I need to talk to you.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.870
我想迈克尔给自己惹大麻烦了
I think Michael has got himself in some trouble.

25:48.240 --> 25:51.140
我想他正计划做些危险的事情
And I think he's planning on doing something dangerous to get out of it.

26:00.500 --> 26:05.840
-谢谢 是什么事...  -迈克尔他是个喜欢帮助别人的人
-Thanks.So what is it that you..  -Michael has a deep need to help people.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.410
这我知道
So I've come to understand.

26:08.490 --> 26:10.320
其实我们就是这么认识的
That's actually how we met.

26:11.350 --> 26:13.850
那些把我带到这里的家伙
There were these men that brought me here.

26:14.570 --> 26:16.240
曾告诉我我会有份好工作
Told me I'd have good job,

26:17.530 --> 26:19.170
但那只是个谎言
but that was just a lie.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.260
他们其实是要把我卖了
They were going to sell me.

26:22.050 --> 26:24.010
他们那么做的时候 我...
And until they did,I...

26:26.100 --> 26:28.980
是迈克尔花钱给我买了自由
Michael paid them off for my freedom.

26:29.470 --> 26:32.900
但他不是要把我占为己有 像其他有些人那样
And not to keep me for himself,like I've heard from other girls,

26:33.020 --> 26:35.120
而是给了我机会
but to give me an opportunity.

26:38.090 --> 26:39.210
他是个好人
He's a good man.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.490
是的 他是
Yes,he is.

26:43.730 --> 26:46.910
尼卡 我会尽自己最大努力帮助迈克尔
Nika,I wanna do whatever I can to help Michael.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.510
而在那么做之前 你得告诉我他卷进了什么事
To do that,I need you to tell me what it is you think he's mixed up in.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.400
我想我不该来找你
I think this is a mistake.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.690
-不 不 不是这样  -请照看一下他
-No,no,it's not at all.  -Please,just keep an eye on him.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.460
不好意思
God,I'm sorry.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.690
能留个电话给我吗 万一我...
Listen,could I just have a contact number for you in case...

27:03.690 --> 27:05.180
我不觉得那是个好主意
I don't think that's a good idea.

27:05.270 --> 27:06.760
请别告诉他我们见过
Please don't tell him that we met.

27:17.390 --> 27:18.820
有件事我不明白
Something I don't get.

27:19.790 --> 27:21.590
为什么杀了我就能阻止你
How could killing me stop you?

27:23.440 --> 27:26.540
因为是我把伊科菲尔德公司的消息泄露出去的
'Cause I'm the one who leaked the information about Ecofield.

27:26.950 --> 27:30.150
他们本有1000种方法掩盖这种事情
They could've covered up the scandal a thousand different ways,

27:30.420 --> 27:33.080
可他们却偏偏选择伪装斯蒂德曼死亡
but they chose to fake Terrence Steadman's death.

27:34.290 --> 27:35.690
并且选择了你
And they chose you

27:36.960 --> 27:39.050
因为他们知道这会把我引出来
'cause they knew it would flush me out.

27:39.420 --> 27:43.050
他们很清楚任何一个男人在知道自己无辜的儿子将被处死的时候
They knew that any man with a son on death row who was innocent

27:43.260 --> 27:45.030
都会毫不犹豫的站出来
would have to come forward.

27:45.860 --> 27:47.210
可是你没有
But you didn't.

27:49.850 --> 27:51.640
我们有苦衷的 林肯
We had a cause,Linc.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.250
我们有苦衷的
We have a cause.

27:55.810 --> 27:57.670
那样就可以阻止他们的战争
Their wars can be averted

27:59.240 --> 28:01.350
从而挽救成千上万的生命
and millions of lives can be saved.

28:01.670 --> 28:04.190
所以你愿意牺牲一个作为代价
So you were willing to sacrifice one.

28:06.390 --> 28:07.360
是的
Yeah.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.760
至少我曾经这么想
At least I thought.

28:15.450 --> 28:17.250
但我不能看着你死
But I couldn't watch you die.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.460
你知道你做过什么吗
You know what you've done?

28:21.890 --> 28:23.800
我孩子的母亲死了
The mother of my child is dead.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.640
-我知道   -你知道?
-I know.  -Do you?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.960
那你也一定知道迈克尔在狐狸河监狱
Then I'm guessing you know Michael's in Fox River

28:31.120 --> 28:33.000
LJ在监狱等着受刑
and LJ's rotting in some jail.

28:33.230 --> 28:35.740
-我都知道   -如果你能好好想想...
-I know all of it.  -If you think for a second...

28:35.760 --> 28:37.220
你现在没得选了
You don't have a choice right now.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.700
都是因为你 这所有的一切
This is all on you. All of it.

28:43.270 --> 28:44.430
是的 我知道
Yeah,I know.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.760
所以我才在这儿
That's why I'm here.

28:47.650 --> 28:50.020
因为我还有机会弥补我的一些过错
'Cause there's still a chance we can make it right.

29:22.380 --> 29:25.840
里面那家伙是我们的交通工具
That man in there is our transportation out of here,

29:26.100 --> 29:29.440
也就是说 如果你现在去惹他麻烦
which means that,you go after him,

29:30.130 --> 29:32.050
你也就搅乱了我和家人见面的机会
and that messes with my chances of me seeing my family.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.910
所以我是不会允许发生这样的事的
So I ain't gonna let that happen.

29:36.390 --> 29:39.820
你为什么不干脆把刀子给我呢
So why don't you just hand me that shank you're holding,huh?

29:44.690 --> 29:46.120
很好
Good.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.010
-嘿 莎拉   -嘿 瑞克
-Hey,Sara.  -Hey,Rick.

30:05.580 --> 30:06.500
你没事吧
You all right?

30:07.110 --> 30:09.530
我找不到钥匙了 能帮我开一下门吗
Yeah.I can't find my keys.Would you let me in?

30:09.660 --> 30:10.650
当然可以
Oh,sure.

30:17.770 --> 30:19.510
没想到会在这儿见到你 
I'm surprised to see you here.

30:20.090 --> 30:21.390
我也没想到
That makes both of us.

30:23.060 --> 30:24.040
听着
Look.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.440
你说得没错  我很抱歉
You were right and I'm sorry.

30:30.290 --> 30:32.010
我不该把你卷进来的
I should never have gotten you involved in this.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.940
没关系   -不 不是这样
-Oh,it's okay.  -No,it's not.

30:34.390 --> 30:36.120
如果有谁知道我问你要...
If anyone knew what I asked...

30:40.490 --> 30:43.490
我自己也不知道为什么这么做
I'm not even sure why I did it.

30:45.370 --> 30:48.230
-谢谢  -现在我们扯平了
-Thank you.  -Now we're even.

30:49.550 --> 30:50.910
你本来就没欠我什么
You didn't owe me anything.

30:51.200 --> 30:54.560
不 我欠你很多 我欠你一切...
Yes,I did.I owed you everything,

30:55.420 --> 30:56.890
但现在都结束了
but that's over now.

30:59.300 --> 31:00.570
再会
Goodbye.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.600
那女医生...
The lady doctor,

31:06.270 --> 31:07.740
她在乎你
she cares for you.

31:19.630 --> 31:20.470
贝利克
Bellick.

31:21.090 --> 31:22.760
是警长 我想他有消息了
It's the sheriff.I think he's got something.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.080
我是贝利克
Go,for Bellick.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.240
我们刚接到一个废物回收站的电话
We just got a call from Steve Schimek up at the junkyard.

31:26.450 --> 31:28.400
我们要找的野马车就在那儿
Our Mustang is on the premises.

31:28.800 --> 31:29.900
他看见布伦斯了
He seen Burrows?

31:30.050 --> 31:32.870
是的 我这有几个小组 估计最多10分钟后到达
Yes,I got a couple of units five,10 minutes away,tops.

31:32.980 --> 31:34.130
好 我马上到
Good,I'm right behind you.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.700
这个 你准备好了吗
Here.You ready to travel?

31:40.870 --> 31:43.340
这周围全是警察 你知道的 不是吗
Place is gonna be crawling with cops.You know that,right?

31:43.500 --> 31:45.090
沿河有条废弃的公路
There's an unimproved road down by the river.

31:45.210 --> 31:47.070
那边可能没被封锁
There's a chance they haven't blocked it off yet.

31:50.810 --> 31:51.820
我们有麻烦了
We got trouble.

31:54.940 --> 31:55.330
快
Come on.

31:56.610 --> 31:57.290
走这边
Through here.

33:11.640 --> 33:12.500
快
Come on.

33:23.980 --> 33:24.770
走吧
Get out of here.

33:25.780 --> 33:26.880
走
Go.

33:28.900 --> 33:29.710
转过身来
Turn around.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.820
贝利克
Bellick!

33:43.510 --> 33:46.190
贝利克 别开枪 别开枪
Bellick,don't shoot! Don't shoot!

33:56.750 --> 33:58.450
原地跪下 跪下 跪下
All right on your knees!Right there! Right there!

34:09.460 --> 34:10.460
想出来逛逛 是么
Thought you'd go for a little stroll,did you?

34:30.600 --> 34:31.870
艾弗卡托的事听说了吗
Did you hear about Avocado?

34:33.270 --> 34:35.800
他那玩意儿被切了
Got his salchicha sliced.

34:36.890 --> 34:39.070
-怎么会   -特维那
-How?  -Tweener.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.120
但艾弗卡托说是被铁丝扎下来的
But Avocado's saying it got caught on the frame

34:41.230 --> 34:43.060
当他在床上乱蹦的时候
while he was hopping down off his bunk,yeah.

34:43.890 --> 34:45.000
他为什么要说谎
Why did he lie?

34:45.230 --> 34:46.690
不想特维那关禁闭
He doesn't want Tweener to go to the SHU

34:46.820 --> 34:48.360
否则他就没法报复了
'cause he can't get him in there.

34:50.040 --> 34:53.550
我想说的是 等艾弗卡托从医务室出来
All I have to say is,as soon as Avocado gets out of the infirmary,

34:53.660 --> 34:55.410
特维那死定了
Tweener is a dead man.

34:56.850 --> 34:58.030
钥匙的事进展怎么样了
How's that key coming?

35:00.280 --> 35:02.450
-你车子上有吗 有时...   -我找过了
-What about your car? You know,sometimes...  -I just checked.

35:04.290 --> 35:05.390
你家呢
Your apartment?

35:06.060 --> 35:09.620
不在那里 因为今天早上我还用过
No,'cause I had them this morning.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.990
那他们一定在这儿某个角落里了
Well,then,they gotta be here.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.740
好好想想 你什么时候发现钥匙没的
Just retrace your steps.When did you first notice they were gone?

35:15.900 --> 35:17.600
吃完午饭回来
When I came back from lunch...

35:38.170 --> 35:40.390
我想看一下今天的探囚纪录
Hey,Kev,I need to take a look at that visitation log.

35:55.110 --> 35:55.760
谢谢
Thanks.

35:58.870 --> 35:59.850
迈克尔
Michael?

36:01.480 --> 36:03.540
我需要知道他在哪儿
I need to know where he is.

36:04.980 --> 36:07.980
-谁  -菲波纳奇
-Who?  -Fibonacci.

36:08.230 --> 36:11.880
转变过程不仅需要我去寻求宽恕
You see,my conversion requires that I not only seek forgiveness,

36:12.010 --> 36:15.850
也要求我宽恕别人 即使是我的最大的敌人
but provide forgiveness,even to my greatest transgressors.

36:17.790 --> 36:19.450
别那样看着我
Don't look at me like that,

36:19.670 --> 36:22.940
好像我还是以前那个老家伙似的 我不是了
like I'm the same old man I used to be.I'm not.

36:24.290 --> 36:30.060
相信我 我需要找到菲波纳奇 这样我们才能重归于好
Trust me,I need to reach out to Fibonacci,so we can heal.

36:32.110 --> 36:35.790
故事编得不错 但我不能告诉你
That's a good story,but the answer is no.

36:36.540 --> 36:37.860
我明白
I understand.

36:40.460 --> 36:41.820
我耐心等
I'll be patient.

36:59.780 --> 37:00.510
你好
Hello.

37:00.710 --> 37:03.400
从现在开始你正式靠边站
Hey,you're officially now on standby.

37:04.170 --> 37:07.170
你要把她带到那边 明白吗
And you'll have her there.Do you understand?

37:07.930 --> 37:09.610
我尽力
Yeah. I'll do my best.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.160
我说了"你明白吗"
Hey,I said,do you understand?

37:16.850 --> 37:19.360
是的 很响亮清楚
Yeah.Loud and clear.

37:19.500 --> 37:23.850
很好 在歌斯公园的跑道上 你在地图上找找
Good.Goose Park airstrip.You can find it on a map.

37:24.100 --> 37:28.480
我再打来的时候 你让那娘们在那边给我等着
As soon as I call,you have that bitch there ready and waiting.

37:42.130 --> 37:44.700
还想让我偷那东西吗 你之前跟我讲的
You still want me to swipe the thing you were asking about?

37:45.870 --> 37:48.060
我现在成了换季大甩卖了
'Cause I'm having a going-out-of-business sale.

37:48.550 --> 37:51.050
你为什么不让自己被关禁闭
Why don't you get yourself to Ad Seg?

37:52.460 --> 37:56.100
那样的话我就得承认 是我对艾弗卡托动的手
For that to happen,I'd have to admit what I did to Avocado.

37:56.550 --> 37:58.520
那会再给我加个20年
That'd get me what,20 years?

37:59.710 --> 38:01.730
不管怎么样我死定了
I'm dead no matter what.

38:03.890 --> 38:06.210
也许还有一条出去的路
1There may be another way out of here.

38:08.340 --> 38:10.930
是啊 装在尸体袋里
Yeah,in a body bag.

38:14.070 --> 38:16.360
我需要知道我能否相信你
I need to know if I can trust you.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.530
我像他们一样正直
I'm as straight up as they come,you know?

38:24.120 --> 38:26.100
不 我是说完全信赖你
No,I mean really trust you.

38:42.280 --> 38:46.250
-你好吗   -我很好 你呢
-How are you?  -I'm fine. You?

38:48.060 --> 38:49.700
不错
Fine.

38:51.900 --> 38:53.450
请把手伸出来
Can I have your hand,please?

39:03.990 --> 39:06.290
-在这儿   -什么在这儿
-Here they are.  -Here what are?

39:06.750 --> 39:09.980
你的钥匙就在你的收件箱里
Your keys,they were right over there by your inbox.

39:10.460 --> 39:13.130
有个维修工等在外面
Well,you got a maintenance guy waiting outside here,

39:13.210 --> 39:15.140
说你要他来换门锁
says you wanted him to change the locks.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.020
要不要叫他回去
Want me to call him off?

39:22.510 --> 39:24.120
不 叫他进来
No,send him in.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.680
会不会打扰你们...
Is it okay if I...

39:33.050 --> 39:35.170
没事 我快好了
Yeah.We're about done here.

39:43.190 --> 39:44.760
有什么问题吗
Is there something wrong?

39:47.030 --> 39:49.610
没有
No.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.720
除非你想谈谈今早发生的事儿
Unless you want to talk about what happened this morning.

39:54.850 --> 39:56.350
我想我有个更好的主意
I think I have a pretty good idea.

39:57.640 --> 39:58.800
我们完了
We're done here.

40:37.420 --> 40:40.220
我要他处于24小时监控下
I want him under 24-hour surveillance.

40:40.610 --> 40:42.940
没我的允许连喷嚏都不能打一个
He doesn't sneeze without my knowing it.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.510
这是干什么 我做错了什么
What the hell for? What did I do?

40:46.620 --> 40:48.380
有人要杀我
Someone tried to kill me.

40:49.400 --> 40:53.040
在距离这8英里的废物厂找到你 我可不敢苟同
Finding you in a junkyard eight miles from here makes me think different.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.100
你的同谋呢
Who was your accomplice?

40:57.680 --> 40:59.030
什么同谋
What accomplice?

40:59.220 --> 41:01.530
24小时监控
24-hour surveillance.

41:35.600 --> 41:36.460
头儿
Boss.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.280
听说艾弗卡托那玩意儿在床上被切掉了
I heard Avocado cut his hose on your bunk.

41:41.510 --> 41:44.070
一定是有什么剧烈的体育运动
Must have been some serious gymnastics going on.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.920
我这次有事情要告诉你 头儿
I got something for you this time,Boss,

41:46.090 --> 41:48.420
但我要求不能让艾弗卡托伤害到我
but I want guaranteed protection from Avocado,

41:48.580 --> 41:50.440
减少我的户外运动时间
and I want time cut off my bid.

41:50.590 --> 41:51.340
还有吗
Anything else?

41:51.500 --> 41:55.420
要不要找个波霸全天伺候啊
Couple of big-canned whores available to you 24

41:55.620 --> 41:57.290
相信我 我的消息绝对值这个价
Believe me,what I got is worth it.

41:58.870 --> 42:00.480
你到底想不想听
So,are you gonna step up or what?

42:03.960 --> 42:05.640
这是你最后一次机会 特维那
This is your last chance,Tweener.

42:05.940 --> 42:09.380
你再乱弹琴 他们一定不会放过你
You blow smoke again,they'll be scraping you off the heel of my boot.

42:09.670 --> 42:11.510
斯科菲尔德那帮干活的家伙
Scofield and his whole PI crew,

42:14.090 --> 42:15.670
他们想越狱
they're escaping.
