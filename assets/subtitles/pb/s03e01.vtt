对此我也无能为力
Look,there's nothing I can do about that.

01:20.360 --> 01:20.960
你当然能
Of course there is

01:20.990 --> 01:21.900
再去犯罪现场看看 定能证实清白

你看 我不过是个夜间办事员而已

你若真想解决问题

01:58.160 --> 02:00.030
留下他们自生自灭

上面刻有政府编号
with U.S. government numbers on it.

凶器既然已经发现
And if a weapon was found,then that lends

04:12.900 --> 04:15.570
那么对自卫一说提供了有利物证
real credence to self-defense as a motive.

04:15.630 --> 04:16.270
很好
Great.

04:16.330 --> 04:18.770

我已作出了安排

我有十足的把握 所有控告都会撤销
I'd be pretty confident the charges will be dropped.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.300
他会无罪释放?
He'd be free?

04:45.370 --> 04:47.600
可能还要面对美国方面的指控
Well,he'd still face charges in the U.S.

04:47.670 --> 04:49.670
但那是出狱以后的事了?
But out of there?

04:49.830 --> 04:50.870

你太聪敏了 居然想出在船上放毒品栽赃
You're so clever like planting the drugs on the boat.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.700
这太嘲讽了

关在监狱里的罗曼

07:47.870 --> 07:49.700
你现在罪有应得了

我需要你的帮助
And that's where you're gonna help me.

这几天我就要接受庭审了
I will have a court date one of these days,

07:53.970 --> 07:55.300
你到时也会出庭

你会告诉大家事实你计划了这一切
And you will tell the truth that you planted this

07:57.730 --> 08:00.330
你设计栽赃 我就可以回家了
and you set this up,and I'm gonna go home.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.930
这太嘲讽了 我对天发誓是你设的局
That's funny,I could have sworn you set this up.

08:06.130 --> 08:08.530
我设的局? 我被关在这儿
I set this up? I'm in here.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.030
幕后者到底对我有何企图?
What does the Company want with me?

08:10.100 --> 08:11.170
为什么挑选巴拿马?
Why Panama?

08:11.230 --> 08:13.500
你觉得我这样子像知道这一切吗?
What,you think I know what they wanted?

我受他们控制
They had me.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.800
听命于他们
I did what they asked me to do

08:17.870 --> 08:19.630
在巴拿马逮捕你

08:19.700 --> 08:21.000
并移送回来

08:21.070 --> 08:22.630

互相帮助 一起逃出去

08:34.600 --> 08:36.570
但我每次看到你
Except every time I look at you,

08:36.630 --> 08:39.230
就想起那个杀了我父亲的凶手
all I can see is the man who killed my father.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.570
你自谋生路吧
You're on your own.

08:52.790 --> 08:55.570
把我老公带出来

有人给我打电话了

08:58.930 --> 09:01.280
把我老公带出来
Bring my husbang out now

09:08.000 --> 09:08.790
小心点
Be careful.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.100
在这里登记 进去后
Sign here to say that once inside,

09:17.170 --> 09:18.570
根据我国法律 就你自己负责了
you're on your own by the law,

09:18.630 --> 09:20.970
任何意外都不受军方或者法律保护
that you're not protected by the military in case of an assault.

09:21.030 --> 09:23.670
任何协助在押犯逃跑的企图
And any attempt to assist an inmate trying to escape

09:23.730 --> 09:25.200
都以死罪论处
will be met with a lethal response.

09:25.270 --> 09:26.900
想都没有想过
Wouldn't dream of it.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.770

或许你已经把逃亡靴给丢了
Yeah,well,maybe you should have lost the cowboy boots.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.200
你害怕了?

Well,you got to find her.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.500
我会的
I will.

林肯 这对我很重要
She's important to me,Linc.

10:36.330 --> 10:39.400

I'll see you tomorrow.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.970
好吗?
All right?

11:15.570 --> 11:16.970
你是美国人 对吧?
American,right?

11:17.030 --> 11:18.770
我热爱美国
I love America.

NBA 特雷西·麦迪的神奇表现
NBA. Tracy McGrady shooting the ball in the hoop from downtown.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.900
不管你想推销什么 我都不感兴趣
Whatever you're selling,I'm not buying.

11:23.970 --> 11:25.600
推销?
Selling?

11:25.670 --> 11:27.500
我只是想跟你说说篮球
I just want to talk basketball.

11:27.570 --> 11:28.730
你喜欢哪个球队?
Who's your team?

11:32.270 --> 11:33.370
小子 跟我们走
Let's go,blanco.

11:33.430 --> 11:34.370
带你熟悉下环境
Orientation.

11:34.430 --> 11:35.400
我没兴趣
I'm not interested.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.300
没你选的份
It's not for you to decide.

11:45.860 --> 11:48.370
守卫说我得在15分钟后离开
Guards say I have to be out in 15 minutes.

11:56.230 --> 11:57.430
把他们带进来
Bring them in.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.900
我真希望他们没让你们吃什么苦头
Well,I hope they haven't been treating you too poorly.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.100
如果有的话 我应该有所耳闻了
I should hear of it if you have.

12:20.170 --> 12:23.300
我想你们能看出这地方与众不同
I think as you can tell,Sona is unlike any other place in the world.

12:23.370 --> 12:26.400
那帮守卫去年仓皇而逃
Huh? Since the riots of last year,they left us here to rot.

12:26.470 --> 12:28.000
他们认为我们会内耗而亡
They figured we would just destroy ourselves,

12:28.070 --> 12:29.800
恰恰相反 我们队伍更壮大了
but instead,we've thrived.

12:29.870 --> 12:32.430
借助于巴拿马运河
With the canal,Panama is now

12:32.500 --> 12:34.230
巴拿马现在成了全球罪犯的孵化基地
a breeding ground for international crime.

12:34.300 --> 12:37.230
我们这的人来自27个不同国家
27 different nationalities we have here.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.830
但不是一个帮派的
But not one gang.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.370
没有一起种族歧视案例
Not one racially-motivated incident.

12:43.970 --> 12:46.300
这都归功于我
It's just me.

12:46.370 --> 12:49.600
平等主义
Egalitarianism

12:49.670 --> 12:51.900
这是我的信仰
I believe is the word.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.400
你不同意吗?
Huh? Did I get that right?

12:54.470 --> 12:56.170
你说是就是了
Right as rain.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.830
操练一下果然长进了
That's what practice does for you.

12:59.900 --> 13:04.270
你们有什么要向我汇报的吗?
Now,is there anything you want to tell me?

13:04.330 --> 13:08.730
我想知道你们被关进来的原因
Any history that you bring to this place that I should know about?

13:16.630 --> 13:19.630
我想你没说实话
I don't think you're quite telling me the truth,

13:19.700 --> 13:21.500
斯科菲尔德先生
Mr. Scofield.

13:21.570 --> 13:23.470
我们已经听到了风声 老兄
We get the news,man.

13:23.530 --> 13:28.170
你在CNN上俨然是个超级明星了
You were quite the superstar on CNN.

13:28.230 --> 13:29.570
救出了你哥后
Man breaks brother out

13:29.630 --> 13:31.330
然后逃亡到巴拿马
and flees to Panama.

13:33.170 --> 13:35.430
但在这你可行不通了
But you're not a superstar here

13:35.500 --> 13:36.600
你没意识到这点吗?
You realize that,don't you?

13:36.670 --> 13:38.130
我不想在起什么波澜
I'm not going to make waves.

13:40.170 --> 13:41.500
凭你的能耐也办不到
It wouldn't be within your power.

13:48.270 --> 13:51.270
我也听说过你们俩
I heard about the two of you.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.570
你们今天闯祸了
You two in the hall today.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.700
但你俩如果想解决问题的话
Now,if you would like to sort your problems out,

13:54.770 --> 13:56.330
方法很简单
it's very simple here.

13:59.070 --> 14:02.630
两人之间意见不同
A man has a beef with another,he makes his problem known.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.230
就直接用男人的方式解决问题
And then we deal with it directly

14:06.300 --> 14:09.400
就在那里
as men over there.

14:09.470 --> 14:12.470
没那个必要
Won't be necessary.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.470
你一直那样发抖的吗
You always shake like that?

14:27.130 --> 14:29.170
还是仅仅出于对某人的畏惧
Or just when you're scared of someone?

14:39.170 --> 14:40.170
你呢?
What about you?

14:41.170 --> 14:42.570
老大 不要伤害我
Dont hurt me man.

14:43.570 --> 14:44.570
我不想惹什么麻烦
I dont want any trouble.

14:52.930 --> 14:54.170
蠢货 绝不允许
Asshole Never

14:54.450 --> 14:57.150
永远别在我的地盘随地大小便
Never use my floor as a bathroom

14:57.670 --> 15:00.430
我想他明白了
I think he gets the message.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.700
我们两个可以单挑
We could go you and me

15:05.770 --> 15:07.370
就在这里
right here.

15:11.070 --> 15:13.900
你真有胆识
You're a brave man,huh?

15:13.970 --> 15:17.270
有种
Brave man.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.870
你很幸运 我现在温和多了
You're lucky I've been meditating.

15:20.930 --> 15:23.630
换作以前 早一枪毙了你
Before,I couldn't take my finger off the trigger,but now

15:23.700 --> 15:26.300
但我现在懂得了控制情绪
now I have mind control.

15:26.370 --> 15:29.370
完全的控制

15:29.430 --> 15:30.730
思想

15:30.800 --> 15:32.570
身体

15:36.770 --> 15:37.770
滚出去吧
Get out

15:38.830 --> 15:41.470
快滚
Get out

15:49.830 --> 15:51.270
浪费我们的时间
He's a waste of our time.

15:51.330 --> 15:55.070
谁能想象索纳出了这样的风云人物
Who would have thought a famous person in Sona.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.630
弱者总是延续弱势
Weak people rally around fame.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.100
他们祈祷上苍 他们对此深信不疑
They worship it. They're blinded by it.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.030
正如你所知
And as you can tell,there are many people

16:01.100 --> 16:02.730
这里还有很多弱者
of weak character behind these walls.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.670
没错 他们会跟随像这样的人
Yes,they will follow a man like this,

16:04.730 --> 16:07.500
他们会给他立碑纪念
and they will put him on a pedestal.

16:07.570 --> 16:12.830
他很有魅力 是吗 宝贝?
He has that charisma,right,mami?

16:12.900 --> 16:14.670
他可比不上你
He's no you.

16:14.730 --> 16:17.430
宝贝 你不用来迎合我
Ah,you don't have to pander me,mami.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.300
我可不是三岁小孩
Soy un hombre maduro.

16:19.370 --> 16:20.470
他很帅 不是吗?
He's good looking,right?

16:21.670 --> 16:24.970
没错 他是很帅
Si. He is good looking.

16:25.770 --> 16:28.170
他是这里最帅的 不是吗?
He's the best looking man in the prison,right?

16:28.230 --> 16:29.830
和你不能比
Not compared to you.

16:30.230 --> 16:31.830
宝贝 让我来告诉你
Let me tell you, mammi.

16:32.230 --> 16:33.830
谁知道呢
Who knows

16:35.230 --> 16:36.830
或许是吧
Maybe

16:37.230 --> 16:39.130
臭婊子 给我滚蛋
Pack up, whore.

16:39.230 --> 16:40.430
别让我再看到你
You are gone.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.520

17:45.640 --> 17:46.770
她失踪了
She's missing.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.900
我们没有她的任何消息
We don't have a report of anything like that.

17:48.970 --> 17:51.200
但如果有的话 给我电话 号码在背面
But if you do,you call me;the number's on the back.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.400

Okay,ser.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.400

18:08.770 --> 18:10.300
你哪弄来的鞋子?
Where'd you get shoes?

18:19.770 --> 18:21.860
该干活还钱付租金了
It's time to start earning your rent around here.

18:21.890 --> 18:22.910
这里不用租金的
There's no rent here.

18:22.940 --> 18:24.400
-这是监狱 -继续说啊
It's prison.Keep talking.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.000

It's going up.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.400
绝对没门
Absolutely not.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.600
再敢放屁
One more word from you,

18:40.670 --> 18:42.170
我让你吃屎 明白没?
and I will drown you in here,you understand?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.570
快点 干活
Now,work.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.200
做完后拿去下水道烧掉
Burn it down in the sewers when you're done.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.170
有新人来了

19:22.300 --> 19:23.370
一个美国人

19:24.240 --> 19:25.300
还有别的事么?

19:25.400 --> 19:27.200
他有只假手

19:56.840 --> 19:59.440
斯科菲尔德 有人来看你了
Scofield,una visita

19:59.500 --> 20:01.570
斯科菲尔德 有人来看你了

20:08.340 --> 20:09.900
斯科菲尔德 先生

埃利奥特 派克
Elliot Pike.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
找我什么事
What do you want?

20:12.070 --> 20:14.300
说实话 是来代表你的
Well,to be frank,to represent you.

20:14.370 --> 20:15.900
-你是律师? -算是吧
You're a lawyer? Of sorts.

20:15.970 --> 20:17.970
法院已经指派了律师给我
The court already appointed me a lawyer.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.440
那或许我可以用别的方法帮你
Then perhaps I can be of assistance in a different way.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.440
我有点怀疑
Somehow I doubt that.

20:26.500 --> 20:29.000
我的靠山可厉害者呢 斯科菲尔德先生
I got a lot of big guns behind me,Mr. Scofield,

20:29.070 --> 20:31.440
你或许会需要他们的
people you might like to have in your corner

20:31.500 --> 20:34.970
你是否该考虑下 越狱呢
should you ever decide,say to break out of here.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.070
你是谁?
Who are you?

20:40.140 --> 20:43.040
我们可以从各方面帮助你
We can assist you in every possible way

20:43.100 --> 20:44.840
一旦你能越过那道墙
once you get past that wall.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.270
像你这样一个身怀绝技的人
There's a reason a guy like you,

20:51.340 --> 20:53.500
被关到这是有原因的 知道么
with your skill set,was put in here,you know.

20:55.740 --> 20:58.300
谈话到此为止
This conversation's over.

20:58.370 --> 21:00.170
斯科菲尔德 你得听听我说的
You ought to hear what I have to say,Scofield.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.040
我们想让事情简单点
We're trying to do this the easy way.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.440
你他妈搞什么 敢动我东西?
What the hell are you doing taking my stash?

21:36.500 --> 21:38.440
说啊 小娘们
Cough it up,you little bitch.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.270
-我没拿 -东西在哪?
I didn't do it. Where is it?

21:40.340 --> 21:42.140
-在哪? -不是我
Where is it? It wasn't me.

21:48.470 --> 21:51.170
你懂私自斗殴的规矩吧
You know the rules about extra-curricular fights

21:51.240 --> 21:53.240
这里可行不通
It doesn't happen here.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.270
他拿走了属于我的东西
He took something that belongs to me.

21:55.340 --> 21:56.340
他不大正常
He's out of his mind.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.600
这事很容易弄明白
Well,it seems pretty easy to get to the bottom of this

21:59.670 --> 22:00.200
搜他的身
check him.

22:06.970 --> 22:09.000
检查他的地方
Check his area.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.270
真见鬼
That's bull.

22:24.070 --> 22:25.140
你们都是
You're both

22:25.200 --> 22:27.770
贱人
scumbags.

22:32.340 --> 22:33.440
伙计 你和我
You and me,man.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.640
我们还没完呢
We're not done here.

22:40.070 --> 22:41.070
你见过这个女的没有
You haven't seen her?

22:41.070 --> 22:42.800
有长得相似的入住过吗
No one like this has checked in?

22:42.840 --> 22:44.040
先生 抱歉没有见过
No Sir.

22:44.440 --> 22:45.440
你真的确定吗
You're absolutely sure?

22:47.540 --> 22:49.600
谢谢
Thanks.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.970
是我
Yeah.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.640
布鲁斯先生 我是伊萨斯队长
Mr. Burrows. Captain Itzuris

22:54.700 --> 22:56.000
正在治安官的办公室里
at the constable's office.

22:56.070 --> 22:59.670
我们找到了一个美国女人
We found an American woman

22:59.740 --> 23:02.040
符合你对你朋友唐克瑞蒂小姐的描述
matching the description of your friend,Ms. Tancredi.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.100
在哪
Where?

23:04.170 --> 23:06.140
停尸房
At the morgue.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.200
他说的什么
What's he saying?

23:20.270 --> 23:21.600
我们不能吃这些
That we can't eat.

23:21.670 --> 23:23.100
那我们应该吃什么
What are we supposed to eat?

23:23.170 --> 23:29.100
求你了 来这一周 我都没进过食
Please. I haven't eaten in the week since i have been here..

23:38.640 --> 23:41.070
他们想要我们像狗一样的讨食
They expect us to forage,like dogs.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.570
我会死的 怎么都是死
I'll die.I will literally die.

23:49.740 --> 23:51.440
伙计 那就死好了
Hang in there,man.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.770
自娱自乐吧 帅哥
Playing by yourself.Same old Pretty.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.270
就是不大合群啊 对吧
Just not good at making friends,are you?

24:29.340 --> 24:31.070
我们之间没什么好说的
We got nothing to say to each other.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.540
换个角度来说
On another note,

24:32.600 --> 24:34.640
如果这是一部由政府导演的大片
on a big picture note,them big government types

24:34.700 --> 24:35.700
把我陷害得这么惨
that shook me down so hard,

24:35.700 --> 24:36.600
为什么他们要把你搞到这里来
why is it they wanted you here?

24:36.670 --> 24:38.240
索纳监狱就是他们的兴趣所在?
Was it Sona they was interested in?

24:38.300 --> 24:39.600
我就是这么想的
That's what I'm thinking.

24:39.670 --> 24:42.070
想让我到这个烂乡下地方来把你搅晕
Want me to get you down here,up in this very county.

24:42.140 --> 24:43.900
你是怎么认为的?
What do you think it is,huh?

24:43.970 --> 24:45.100
你认为真有人会对索纳监狱有兴趣?
You think it's Sona?

24:45.170 --> 24:47.240
谁会对这种破烂地方有兴趣?
Who'd be interested in a dump like this?

24:47.300 --> 24:50.570
有人逃跑
Runner Runner

25:15.970 --> 25:18.240
不 不
No No

26:06.800 --> 26:07.800
谢谢您通知我
Thanks for getting back to me.

26:08.060 --> 26:09.200
不用谢
No problem.

26:09.260 --> 26:11.530
尸体今天上午被钓出池塘
The body was fished out of the pond

26:11.600 --> 26:13.560
-今早发现的第一件 -在哪里发现的?
-first thing this morning. -Where?

26:13.630 --> 26:16.200
卡雷 瑟森塔赛思
Calle Sesenta-Seis.

26:16.260 --> 26:17.960
就在阿凡尼达 科隆西边
Just west of Avenida Colon.

26:21.030 --> 26:23.030
先生?
Sir?

26:23.100 --> 26:25.230
那是我最后一次看见她的地方
That's the last place I saw her.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.730
这不是她
It's not her.

26:45.260 --> 26:47.200
这不是她
It's not her.

27:01.130 --> 27:03.430
有人控告你
Someone's thrown the glove down on you.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.860
还是很严重的事情呢 是吧?
The gauntlet,right?

27:04.930 --> 27:07.000
是啊 只是我们都知道我没拿那些药
Yeah,except we both know I didn't take those drugs.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.760
我不是法官
I'm not the judge.

27:08.830 --> 27:10.800
我不处理这里的上诉
I don't deal in the claims people make.

27:10.860 --> 27:12.360
我只确保这里得按照规则运作
I just make sure the rules are followed.

27:12.430 --> 27:13.700
规则说一切冤屈的处理方法
And the rules say all grievances are dealt with

27:13.760 --> 27:16.700
都是2个人到圈里决斗
two men in a ring,a fight.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.700
我明天就离开了 没有必要这样
I'll be leaving tomorrow,so that won't be necessary.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.800
也许对你来说没有必要
It may not be necessary to you,

27:21.860 --> 27:23.130
但是对我来说很必要
but it is to me.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.130
我有职责维护这里的秩序
I have a duty to maintain order here

27:26.200 --> 27:28.530
用一个铁定的合法体制来确保
an ironclad legal system that assures that

27:28.600 --> 27:30.860
没人能自作主张处理他们的矛盾
no one goes independent with their grievances,

27:30.930 --> 27:32.860
那可是其他监狱里常有的事
as is so often the case in other prisons.

27:32.930 --> 27:33.930
在这里
Here,

27:34.000 --> 27:35.060
存在着一个体制
there is a system,

27:35.130 --> 27:37.300
这个体制就代表了秩序
and that system means order.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.060
所以不管你是否赞同
So whether you agree with it or not

27:39.130 --> 27:41.100
都和我没有关系
does not matter to me.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.830
我的议程比你的更重要
There's a larger agenda than yours.

27:47.260 --> 27:49.030
如果我拒绝会怎么样?
What happens if I refuse?

27:50.200 --> 27:53.400
我们会去找你
We'll come for you.

27:53.460 --> 27:55.900
我能保证你会得到一个
And I can guarantee you that is an outcome

27:55.960 --> 27:58.400
你不喜欢的结局
that you will not like.

27:58.460 --> 28:00.000
告诉我
Tell me something

28:00.060 --> 28:01.700
你总是用计来使人决斗吗?
do you always set up your fights?

28:01.760 --> 28:04.730
我和那一点关系都没有
I had nothing to do with it.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.830
整个监狱和我有冲突的人
And yet the only one in this whole prison

28:06.900 --> 28:09.000
至今只有你
who has a problem with me is you.

28:09.060 --> 28:12.230
我会很乐意见到巨星陨落
I'd be glad to see you go down superstar

28:25.330 --> 28:26.500
继续 继续做
Go on,keep going.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.800
在角落里把它烧了
You burn it around the corner.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.530
伙计
Buddy.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.560
可以帮我一个忙吗
Think you can do me a favor?

29:09.630 --> 29:11.700
休想
Bite me.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.830
我能给你吃的
I can feed you.

29:15.260 --> 29:17.800
几周前 我和你一样的处境
A few weeks ago,I was in your shoes.

29:17.860 --> 29:19.930
好几天没有东西吃
Didn't get any food for days.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.360
他们想让我死
They'd have let me die,

29:21.430 --> 29:22.860
就像他们想让你死一样
just like they're gonna let you die.

29:22.930 --> 29:24.460
回到给我吃的那个话题
Get back to the"feed me"part.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.130
鸡肉
Chicken.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.660
伙计 你哪里来的鸡肉
Man,where'd you get chicken?

29:34.200 --> 29:35.800
那不是鸡肉
That's not chicken.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.460
-还要再来点吗 -要
-Want some more? -Yeah.

29:43.530 --> 29:46.230
那你要帮我跑个腿
Then you're gonna have to run an errand for me.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.600
跑什么腿
What kind of errand?

30:57.960 --> 31:00.060

32:26.200 --> 32:28.700
使用诡计 这就是你的伎俩?
Fighting dirty? That's your secret?

要说的都说完了

34:54.960 --> 34:56.630
我不会打的
I'm not going to fight

35:30.200 --> 35:34.060
你还没明白规矩 朋友
I don't think you understand the rules,friend.

35:34.130 --> 35:35.960

36:30.960 --> 36:36.000
不能用武器 规矩不能坏 记得吗?
Rules are rules. Remember?

36:37.300 --> 36:39.140

38:13.540 --> 38:14.600

38:20.640 --> 38:22.640
你的脸怎么了?
What happened to your face?

38:22.700 --> 38:24.140
