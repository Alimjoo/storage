00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
■

01:06.690 --> 01:10.110
威廉森 快进来

01:10.120 --> 01:11.320
这里怎么回事
What the hell happened in here?

01:11.330 --> 01:14.110
一点小意外
An accident.

01:14.120 --> 01:18.110

Let me get in here.Hold on. Come on

01:23.200 --> 01:26.060
出去
Get out

01:27.230 --> 01:30.470
我以为你只是想和他说些悄悄话
I thought you said you were gonna have a conversation with him

01:30.480 --> 01:33.260
没错
Yeah, I did

01:33.270 --> 01:38.200
事情有点过火而已
Things... escalated.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.160
我们需要帮忙
We need some help here.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.740
带他去3号房
Bring him on into three

01:42.750 --> 01:46.530
凯希 给他十毫升麻醉药
Kathy, I'm gonna need 10ccs of Xylocaine

Thanks, guys. I'll take it from here

01:55.220 --> 01:58.460
我说了 谢谢 我会处理的
I said thank you. I'll take it from here

01:58.470 --> 02:01.630
走吧
Let's go

02:02.890 --> 02:03.900
好的
OK

02:03.910 --> 02:07.310
让我看看你的脚
Let's take a look at you

02:07.360 --> 02:11.990
你会没事的
You're OK. You're OK

02:16.050 --> 02:17.830
发生了什么
What happened?

02:17.840 --> 02:19.430
没什么
Nothing

02:19.440 --> 02:20.720
这是没什么吗 迈克尔
This isn't nothing?Michael

02:20.730 --> 02:22.800
我要知道发生了什么
I need you to tell me what happened

02:22.810 --> 02:26.110
不要逼我对你说谎
Don't make me lie to you

02:26.120 --> 02:27.250
拜托
Please

02:34.830 --> 02:36.790
我希望内务部能对这件事进行调查
I think you had better start an investigation

02:36.800 --> 02:37.890
不需要
Oh, there's no need.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.430
我们很清楚发生了什么
We know what happened

02:39.440 --> 02:42.050
那麻烦你告诉我
Perhaps you'd been good enoughto enlighten me

02:42.060 --> 02:43.350
地上有一把除草剪刀
There was a pair of gardening shears

02:43.360 --> 02:44.870
就在他工作的小屋子里
On the floor of the shed

02:44.880 --> 02:46.960
很明显 他踩了上去
He stepped on them

02:46.970 --> 02:48.760
然后刀锋直接穿过了鞋割伤了他的脚
The blade went right through his boot, huh?

02:48.770 --> 02:49.830
是的
Yeah

02:49.840 --> 02:53.490
但是为什么他的脚上没有鞋呢
So why wasn't the boot still on his foot?

02:53.500 --> 02:55.730
我说过了 医生
Like I said, Doctor

02:55.740 --> 02:58.470
我们已经搞定了这件事
We got it taken care of

02:58.480 --> 03:02.080
走吧
Let's go

03:34.020 --> 03:35.810
-我要把那个混蛋杀了  -不行
-I'll kill that scum.  -You won't.

03:35.820 --> 03:38.130
你杀了他就等于扼杀了我们离开的机会
You kill him, you kill our ticket out of here

03:38.140 --> 03:39.350
看他对你做了什么
Look what he did to you

03:39.360 --> 03:40.880
我怕你活不过下一秒钟
You won't last a second here

03:40.890 --> 03:43.250
如果我不做点什么
Unless I do something about it

03:43.260 --> 03:45.770
你听过顶点飞行公司吗
You ever hear of Top Flight Charters?

03:45.780 --> 03:46.310
听过
Yeah

03:46.320 --> 03:49.380
他们运作中西部 一些小型机场的航线
They operate flights from small airfields in the Midwest

03:49.390 --> 03:51.370
那公司离这里不到10英里
Like the one ten miles away.

03:51.380 --> 03:54.320
属于阿布鲁奇名下的空壳公司
They're run by a shell corporation Abruzzi owns

03:54.330 --> 03:55.130
如果我们跟他合作
We get him on board

03:55.140 --> 03:56.550
就可以保证我们能在越狱的当晚
there'll be a flight for us

03:56.560 --> 03:58.350
坐上飞机销声匿迹
The night we get outside these walls.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.910
你愿意把逃亡的成败
You're willing to risk the entire escape

03:59.920 --> 04:02.010
寄托在这个你根本不了解的人身上
On a guy you don't even know?

04:02.020 --> 04:05.030
谋事在人
Preparation can only take you so far

04:05.040 --> 04:09.480
但成事在天
After that, you gotta take a few leaps of faith

04:09.490 --> 04:11.330
我不相信阿布鲁奇是可以信任的
Abruzzi's a huge leap of faith

04:11.340 --> 04:13.140
不仅仅是阿布鲁奇
I'm not talking about Abruzzi

04:13.150 --> 04:15.120
还有一人是关键人物
There's someone else who holds the key to this entire thing

04:15.130 --> 04:18.310
有了他 才决定最后是成功还是失败
It either works or it doesn't

04:18.320 --> 04:19.400
问题是
Problem is

04:19.410 --> 04:23.720
我要进来以后 才能肯定这个人是谁
I couldn't know who that was until he got in here

04:23.940 --> 04:24.910
苏克雷
Sucre?

04:24.920 --> 04:27.630
你不是认真的吧
You can't be serious

04:27.640 --> 04:30.390
那是一个贼 你不能相信他
The guy's a thief, Michael. He can't be trusted

04:30.400 --> 04:32.240
必须相信他
Gonna have to trust him

04:32.250 --> 04:35.020
因为他是我的室友
Because he's my cellmate

04:35.030 --> 04:36.370
你对他了解多少
How well do you know him?

04:36.380 --> 04:39.040
认识了不过一周
About as well as a man can in a week.

04:39.050 --> 04:41.730
你告诉他等于告诉所有人
You tell him, he tells everyone

04:41.740 --> 04:43.820
那样我们就完了 你明白吗
We're done.You know that, right?

04:43.830 --> 04:44.600
他不加入的话
If he's not on board

04:44.610 --> 04:46.200
我没法在牢房做任何事
There's no digging in that cell

04:46.210 --> 04:48.560
如果真的是这样
And if there's no digging

04:48.570 --> 04:51.650
逃亡只是做梦
Then there's no escape

05:29.800 --> 05:34.120
你好 请在 嘀 一声后留下口讯
Thank you for calling.Please leave a message after the tone

05:34.130 --> 05:35.530

是我 亲爱的 你在吗
It's me, baby. Are you there?

05:37.800 --> 05:41.810
你在的话接电话 我被关禁闭了
Pick up if you're there, Mari.I've been in the SHU

05:41.820 --> 05:44.360
我一直很想你
I've been thinking about you

05:44.370 --> 05:46.490
想你迷人的身体
About your body

05:46.500 --> 05:48.750
我一直在想你的身体
God, I've been thinking about your body

05:48.760 --> 05:50.690

05:56.360 --> 05:58.920
抱歉打扰你
Sorry to bother you at home

05:58.930 --> 06:01.360
你知道玛丽克鲁兹的手机怎么了吗
Do you know what's up with Maricruz's cellphone?

06:01.370 --> 06:03.880
一直都打不通 都是留言信箱
It just keeps going straight to voice mail

06:03.890 --> 06:05.510
她大概把手机关掉了
Maybe she has it turned off

06:05.520 --> 06:07.390
请问你知道她在哪里吗
Any chance you know where she is?

06:07.400 --> 06:10.170
我当然知道
I know exactly where she is.

06:10.180 --> 06:11.400
她在哪里
And that would be?

06:11.410 --> 06:14.500
-和赫克特在一起   -赫克特
-With Hector.  -Hector?

06:14.510 --> 06:15.510
是的
That's right

06:15.520 --> 06:16.890
他们出去逛街了 我想
They're at the mall, I think

06:16.900 --> 06:18.360
你不想我再见她了
I don't suppose next time you see her

06:18.370 --> 06:21.040
你是不是能让她把手机打开
You could have her turn her phone back on?

06:21.050 --> 06:23.370
德尔加多太太 我知道你不喜欢我
Mrs Delgado, I know you don't like me

06:23.380 --> 06:26.010
但我爱你女儿 她也爱我
But I love your daughter and she loves me

06:26.020 --> 06:28.080
我们快结婚了 你知道吗
We're gonna get married, you know?

06:28.090 --> 06:31.610
如果你是一个明白人 你也真正爱她的话
If you were a decent man,and you really loved her

06:31.620 --> 06:34.480
就不要再缠着她了
You'd let her live her life

06:34.490 --> 06:36.920
这话是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

06:36.930 --> 06:40.550
我会告诉她你打过电话来
I'll tell her you called

07:46.710 --> 07:49.000
我想搞点破坏
I'm looking to do some damage

07:49.010 --> 07:50.740
那你来对地方了
Well, you've come to the right place.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.480
我要慢慢的那种
I want to do it slow.

07:53.490 --> 07:55.140
造成最大痛苦的
Inflict the maximum amount of pain

07:55.150 --> 07:56.740
让人求死不能
So a guy wishes he'd die

07:56.750 --> 07:57.570
你明白的 就是那种快死了
And get it over with,

07:57.580 --> 08:00.530
但又不会去见上帝的那种
But just can't quite get there.

08:00.540 --> 08:03.720
明白
Oh, I got that.

08:03.730 --> 08:07.330
明白了
I got that.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.710
来看看这个吧 老大
Look at this right here, boss.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.990
我宝贝的收割者
I call it the gutter.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.750
从胃那里插进去
You jam it in the stomach.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.270
肠子都给拉出来
These bits hook the intestines.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.480
只要轻轻一拉
You give it a pull back

08:22.490 --> 08:25.990
那个可怜虫的内脏会乱成一团
poor sucker's guts are hanging right out of his stomach

08:26.000 --> 08:27.750
他会像你说的那样
And he'll get a real good look at emcos

08:27.760 --> 08:29.510
求死不能
The wound's not fatal

08:29.520 --> 08:35.610
至少在伤口感染之前不会死
At least not until the infection sets in.

08:38.700 --> 08:42.930
你真是一个变态的家伙 你知道吗
You're one sick puppy,you know that?

08:42.940 --> 08:46.300
谢谢
Thank you.

09:03.570 --> 09:05.340
你怎么了
What happened?

09:05.350 --> 09:08.980
我很好
I'm OK.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.890
他们打你了吗
They've gotten to you, haven't they?

09:14.900 --> 09:16.940
那些囚犯
The other prisoners.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.480
天呢 迈克尔 这地方会让你送命的
My God, Michael, this place is gonna kill you.

09:19.490 --> 09:21.110
你说你跟一个女人有接触
You said you talked to a woman.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.780
-她叫什么  -莱提莎
-What was her name?  -Leticia

09:24.790 --> 09:27.010
-莱提莎·巴里斯  -你怎么知道
-Leticia Barris.  -How'd you know?

09:27.020 --> 09:29.340
一年前 我也在做你现在同样的事情
A year ago I was doing exactly what you're doing

09:29.350 --> 09:31.690
试图找出真相
Trying to find out the truth.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.060
结果什么都没查到 维罗妮卡
It's a bottomless pit, Veronica.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.380
他们都设计好了
They designed it

09:35.390 --> 09:37.090
一旦你穷追不舍
So that when you got to the bottom of it

09:37.100 --> 09:38.450
林肯也会被杀
Lincoln would be dead

09:38.460 --> 09:40.330
你为什么不告诉我你也一直在查这事
Why didn't you tell me you were doing this ?

09:40.340 --> 09:41.940
一旦日子定下来
Once the day was set

09:41.950 --> 09:44.420
最终上诉被驳回
Once that final appeal had been rejected

09:44.430 --> 09:47.530
他只剩下60天的时间
he had 60 days to live

09:47.540 --> 09:48.690
我们不能任由他们摆布
I figured I could play their game

09:48.700 --> 09:51.090
眼睁睁看着他死
and watch him die in the process

09:51.100 --> 09:53.130
我要把事情掌握在自己手里
Or take matters into my own hands.

09:53.140 --> 09:55.290
你不需要这样做
You don't have to do that

09:55.300 --> 09:57.520
莱提莎知道一些东西 我要找出来
Leticia knows something. If I can get it out of her

09:57.530 --> 09:59.920
也许能重开林肯的案子
Maybe we can reopen the case

09:59.930 --> 10:01.590
她说什么了
What'd she tell you ?

10:01.600 --> 10:02.820
她说有人
Somebody else

10:02.830 --> 10:05.320
是这策划谋杀副总统兄弟的幕后黑手
was behind the killing of the vice president's brother.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.650
谁 她走掉了
Who? She took off

10:06.660 --> 10:11.000
在她说出来前就走掉了
Before I got anything out of her.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.980
她是乐土计划的一部分
She's holed up in the Elysian Fields project.

10:12.990 --> 10:14.400
我和她约了今天下午见面
I'll go see her this afternoon.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.070
那地方很危险
That place is dangerous.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.610
找人陪你去
Take someone with you.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.110
谁
Who?

10:19.120 --> 10:20.860
可能你的未婚夫会是一个好人选
Fiance'd be a good place to start.

10:20.870 --> 10:25.650
我想这会是他最不愿意做的一件事
I think that's probably the last thing in the world Sebastian would ever want to do.

10:25.660 --> 10:27.030
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.800
我也是
Me too.

10:36.290 --> 10:39.170
没有前科 一个好学生
No priors, a good student.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.500
因为贩药被抓住
Then you get yourself arrested for intent to sell.

10:42.510 --> 10:44.660
好日子过腻了
 Good life get a little boring?

10:44.670 --> 10:46.770
我一时糊涂
It was stupid

10:46.780 --> 10:47.870
不会再发生这样的事情
It won't happen again

10:47.880 --> 10:50.580
我们就是要确认这一点
Well, we're all here to make sure of that

10:50.590 --> 10:53.560
你来之前我跟你母亲聊过
I took some to speak to your mother before you came in

10:53.570 --> 10:55.580
她告诉我其实
She told me that

10:55.590 --> 10:57.250
你这么做是有原因的
there were some extenuating circumstances...

10:57.260 --> 10:59.110
如果你想说在监狱的那个人
If you mean that guy at Fox River,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.110
他跟这事没有一点关系
He's got nothing to do with this.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.390
他拒绝称呼他为父亲
He refuses to call him his father.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.720
这个世界没有他会更好
The world would be better without him.

11:04.730 --> 11:05.530
LJ
LJ

11:05.540 --> 11:08.220
你的火气可不小啊 年轻人
It's clear to me you've got a lot of anger, young man.

11:08.230 --> 11:11.620
这样的情绪会让你做错事
It could land you in the wrong place.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.300
为了避免你再犯错
To make sure that doesn't happen,

11:13.310 --> 11:15.400
每周你要向我报到一次
You'll check in with me once a week.

11:15.410 --> 11:17.730
每周五 一小时
Fridays. One hour.

11:17.740 --> 11:20.250
在学校不能无故缺席 成绩要良好
Your grades need to be pristine

11:20.260 --> 11:21.190
当然
Absolutely.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.340
同时我有一个建议
I will give you an really idea

11:22.350 --> 11:25.240
你必须控制你的情绪 而不是被情绪控制
Where that anger will get you if you don't rein it in,

11:25.250 --> 11:28.110
我会让你参加一个监狱辅导计划
I'll sign you up for the programme at Fox River.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.640
在里面 你会有自己的导师
You'll have a mentor who you'll work with weekly.

11:30.650 --> 11:32.190
每周与你见面并给你相关辅导
Give you some perspective.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.660
导师
A mentor?

11:34.670 --> 11:38.380
你的父亲
Your father.

11:59.050 --> 12:01.930
告诉我这不是我想的那东西
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

12:01.940 --> 12:03.990
这不是你想的那东西
It isn't what you think it is.

12:04.000 --> 12:04.980
小嫩鸡
Fish

12:04.990 --> 12:06.710
你在这里有手机
A cellphone in here?

12:06.720 --> 12:08.570
这是罪加一等
That's cardinal sin number one.

12:08.580 --> 12:10.770
他们会在你刑期上加判你2年
They can tack two years onto your bid.

12:10.780 --> 12:12.480
如果你被捉到的话
If they catch you.

12:12.490 --> 12:13.980
你知道我会有麻烦
You know what trouble

12:13.990 --> 12:17.620
就因为知道这事
I can get for knowing this?

12:19.090 --> 12:24.720
那是不是我现在需要就可以打电话
Now, that means you can make calls whenever you want, right?

12:26.760 --> 12:28.540
我不喜欢你现在的眼神
I don't like the look in your eye.

12:28.550 --> 12:30.820
里面的东西 你从来没见过
What's in there, you never saw it

12:30.830 --> 12:34.530
明白吗
Got it?

12:38.830 --> 12:41.110
你为何不写下任何一个名字
Why didn't you include any names?

12:41.120 --> 12:43.920
我为什么要让别人看着我死去
Why would I want anyone to watch me die?

12:43.930 --> 12:47.320
我见过很多人
I've seen it happen a number of ways.

12:47.330 --> 12:49.120
有些希望独自离去
Some people want to go it alone

12:49.130 --> 12:53.900
而另一些却在死前还在唠唠叨叨
Others have grandiose statements they want to make

12:53.910 --> 12:58.540
当然大部分人希望家人的陪伴
But most want some member of their family there

12:58.550 --> 13:03.230
在他们离开这个世界的时候
Before they leave this world

13:03.360 --> 13:05.410
我选择独自承受
I'll do it alone.

13:05.420 --> 13:08.670
孩子 我的建议是
Son, in my opinion,

13:08.680 --> 13:11.890
选择孤独离去的人
All inmates who have made that choice

13:11.900 --> 13:17.420
多半在临死前 后悔自己的决定
Have deeply regretted it in their final minutes.

13:17.780 --> 13:21.480
我
I'll...

13:21.990 --> 13:24.230
你留着这份申请表
Leave it blank for now.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.450
你剩下不到4周的时间
You have less than four weeks now.

13:26.460 --> 13:30.760
再仔细考虑一下
You should give it some thought.

13:49.400 --> 13:52.240
我要找 莱提莎·巴里斯
Hi, I'm looking for Leticia Barris.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.720
5号房
Five.

13:53.730 --> 13:57.100
谢谢
Thank you.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.700
你好
Hello?

14:24.270 --> 14:27.000
不要动
Don't you move a muscle.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.500
冷静点 莱提莎
Take it easy, Leticia.

14:35.510 --> 14:37.320
你和他们是一伙的 不是吗?
You're working with them , arn't you ?

14:37.330 --> 14:38.910
别把我当傻瓜
You think I'm stupid, lady?

14:38.920 --> 14:39.970
我知道我电话被监听了
I hear the clicks on my phone,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.840
还有停在对面马路的车
I see the cars on the street.

14:41.850 --> 14:45.170
我知道你很害怕 我也是
I know you're scared. I am too.

14:45.180 --> 14:49.760
请你把枪放下
But, please, put the gun down.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.360
你去哪里
Where you going?

14:54.370 --> 14:56.770
爱尔兰 去哪里有何分别
Ireland. What difference does it make?

14:56.780 --> 14:57.730
有分别
All the difference.

14:57.740 --> 14:59.260
你不曾在法庭作供
Nobody got your testimony.

14:59.270 --> 15:01.930
所以我现在还活着
That's the exact reason I'm still breathing.

15:01.940 --> 15:04.070
我不是你的敌人 你一定要相信我
I'm not with them. You have to believe me.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.320
那你偷偷来找我目的何在
What are you sneaking in here for?

15:06.330 --> 15:07.870
我只是担心他们先来抓你
I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.

15:07.880 --> 15:08.960
是吗
Oh, yeah?

15:08.970 --> 15:10.710
你为什么这么关心我的处境
Why do you care about my wellbeing

15:10.720 --> 15:12.230
只是一时兴起
All of a sudden?

15:12.240 --> 15:13.490
不是的
I don't.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.330
这才是句真话
Finally, an honest answer.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.960
也许你可以救林肯
But maybe you can save Lincoln.

15:17.970 --> 15:21.050
还有把杀你男友的人
And maybe you can bring down the guys who killed your boyfriend

15:21.060 --> 15:22.400
绳之于法
In the process.

15:22.410 --> 15:23.430
如果被杀的是你
If someone killed you

15:23.440 --> 15:25.280
你男友也会这样做吧
And Crab could've done something to them

15:25.290 --> 15:27.850
你以为他不会吗
You think he would have?

15:27.860 --> 15:29.800
我没有他那么坚强
I'm not as strong as he was

15:29.810 --> 15:31.630
我不能对付那些人
I can't take those people on.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.970
我来对付那些人
I'll take them on.

15:33.980 --> 15:35.990
你只需要来我办公室
All you have to do is come to my office

15:36.000 --> 15:37.710
告诉我你所知道的
And tell me what you know

15:37.720 --> 15:38.250
我会记录下来
I'll type it up

15:38.260 --> 15:41.390
签署一份宣誓书后你就可以离开
You can sign the affidavit and split.

15:41.400 --> 15:47.140
有需要我甚至可以 亲自送你去机场
I'll take you to the airport myself.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.940
巴利克
Bellick.

16:29.950 --> 16:32.090
怎么了 林肯
Hey, what's up, Lincoln?

16:32.100 --> 16:34.890
下几个星期 我需要多一点外出的时间
I want extra time outside for the next two weeks.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.950
但你一定要刷墙的
Paint fumes in PI must be getting to you.

16:37.960 --> 16:41.920
这里允许带手机吗
Cellphones allowed in here?

16:42.720 --> 16:44.340
谁
Who?

16:44.350 --> 16:46.510
额外的放风时间
Extra time outside

16:46.520 --> 16:48.390
还要一些烟
Couple cigarettes

16:48.400 --> 16:49.610
每周半小时
Half-hour one week

16:49.620 --> 16:53.350
一支烟
One cigarette

16:58.460 --> 17:02.840
知道叫苏克雷的家伙
Know a con named Sucre?

17:10.850 --> 17:13.630
我实在不明白 约翰
This is what I don't understand, John

17:13.640 --> 17:16.130
菲波纳奇 指正你
Otto Fibonacci fingers you

17:16.140 --> 17:19.150
他让你下半辈子蹲在大牢里
He put you in prison for life

17:19.160 --> 17:22.380
你似乎对此漠不关心
Yet you act like you don't even want to find out where he is

17:22.390 --> 17:24.560
这不是真的 菲利
That's not true, Philly.

17:24.570 --> 17:25.560
是不是你觉得自己
Maybe you don't think you

17:25.570 --> 17:26.780
已经一无所有了
Have anything to lose any more

17:26.790 --> 17:28.700
你已经在里面了
You're already locked up.

17:28.710 --> 17:29.860
你是不是
Maybe

17:29.870 --> 17:31.500
喜欢呆在里面
You like it here

17:31.510 --> 17:33.430
我不知道
I don't know.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.480
我只是肯定
But what I do know is that

17:34.490 --> 17:37.620
菲波纳奇 会在下月作证
If Fibonacci testifies next month

17:37.630 --> 17:39.970
我快要成为你的邻居了
You and I are gonna be neighbours.

17:39.980 --> 17:42.520
我不会让这一切发生
And I am not going to let that happen

17:42.530 --> 17:47.140
我想你不会适应里面的环境的 菲利
I don't think you would fit in here, Philly.

17:47.240 --> 17:52.860
名牌衬衣 领带和西装
Fancy suits and ties and shirts.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.070
我想你是对的
I think you're right

17:55.080 --> 17:57.120
我不想跟你废话
So let's cut to the chase.

17:57.130 --> 17:59.130
你对付那小子没有
Did you break this kid?

17:59.140 --> 18:03.850
他有没有告诉你 菲波纳奇 的下落
Did he tell you where Fibonacci is?

18:10.230 --> 18:16.010
-这是什么  -一个小礼物
-What is this?  -It's a little gift from me to you.

18:17.630 --> 18:23.210
-这是他的  -他不肯开口
-Are these his?  -Yeah. He won't crack

18:24.590 --> 18:29.500
我想你要另找方法解决这事情
Well, perhaps you should consider using a different methodology then, John

18:29.510 --> 18:30.460
据我所知
From what I gather

18:30.470 --> 18:34.860
有些东西比肉体伤害更能让人屈服
there are far worse threats in prison other than bodily harm

18:34.870 --> 18:37.470
记得以前你信任我
When you used to trust me, Philly

18:37.480 --> 18:40.500
是因为我总能把事情办好
That I would get things done?

18:40.510 --> 18:41.240
以前我信任你
That was

18:41.250 --> 18:46.300
是因为你确实能把事情做好
When you actually did get things done.

18:50.850 --> 18:51.730
爹地
Daddy!

18:51.740 --> 18:54.890
你听到那消息了吗
Did you hear the news?

18:54.900 --> 18:57.640
什么消息
What... what news?

18:57.650 --> 18:59.360
我们会和 菲利 叔叔
We're going to stay with Uncle Philly

18:59.370 --> 19:00.780
一起到湖边玩几个星期
At the lake for a few weeks

19:00.790 --> 19:04.480
是的 我们会玩得很开心
Yeah, and we're gonna have a good time.

19:04.490 --> 19:07.230
你是对的 约翰
You're right, John

19:07.240 --> 19:09.320
我确实信任你
Maybe you're right.I do trust you.

19:09.330 --> 19:15.110
而你不会让我失望的 对吗
Now, you're gonna take care of that thing, aren't you?

19:20.370 --> 19:22.190
你的家属探访怎么样
How are those bone-yard visits

19:22.200 --> 19:26.220
和你女友的那个
Going with that girlfriend of yours?

19:26.560 --> 19:30.890
我想应该很不错吧
I imagine pretty good, huh?

19:33.150 --> 19:36.690
你知道这是
You know visitation rules stipulate that conjugals

19:36.700 --> 19:38.300
已婚犯人的专利
Are only for married couples.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.940
我们订婚了
We're engaged

19:39.950 --> 19:41.300
而且
Besides

19:41.310 --> 19:45.000
我一向安分守纪
I got that coming to me because I ain't caused no static in this place

19:45.010 --> 19:49.020
请不要剥夺我的权利
Please, don't dead my conjugals.

19:49.030 --> 19:51.420
我不会的
I won't.

19:51.430 --> 19:53.180
谢谢
Thank you.

19:53.190 --> 19:55.810
但作为交换
But in exchange

19:55.820 --> 19:59.410
我要你告诉我那手机的事情
You have to tell me where that cellphone is.

19:59.420 --> 20:00.780
手机
Cellphone?

20:00.790 --> 20:02.540
不要装傻
Don't play stupid with me

20:02.550 --> 20:05.410
这是你保住操女人的权利的唯一机会
I'm giving you a chance to save your precious conjugals

20:05.420 --> 20:08.110
如果你说谎 就什么都没了
You lie to me, they're gone

20:08.120 --> 20:12.110
永远都不会有了
And they're never coming back.

20:12.120 --> 20:17.060
那手机在哪里
Where's that cellphone?

20:43.340 --> 20:44.570
特纳
Turner

20:44.580 --> 20:45.650
你的换岗批准了
Your transfer came in.

20:45.660 --> 20:50.040
上头要你负责管理
They want you in administration.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.720
他没开口
He didn't talk.

21:12.510 --> 21:18.360
作为回报 我只想打打电话
All I got to say is I better get to make all the calls I want.

21:19.510 --> 21:24.060
这有点困难
Gonna be kinda hard.

21:25.940 --> 21:28.720
肥皂
Soap?

21:28.730 --> 21:31.200
我因为一块肥皂失去夫妻权利
I lost my conjugals over soap?

21:31.210 --> 21:32.410
你是失去了一点权利
You may have lost your conjugals

21:32.420 --> 21:34.140
但我会给你更多
But I can do you one better

21:34.150 --> 21:36.070
让你们可以在一起
I can get you to her.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.330
和玛丽克鲁兹
With Maricruz?

21:37.340 --> 21:38.780
你让我们在一起 没错
You can get me to Maricruz?That's right

21:38.790 --> 21:42.090
你要怎么做
How you gonna do that?

21:42.100 --> 21:45.280
我们准备越狱
We're breaking out of here.

21:45.290 --> 21:46.990
怎么做
How?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.420
从我们的牢房开始
Starts in our cell

21:48.430 --> 21:52.470
我们的牢房
In our cell?

21:52.480 --> 21:54.540
告诉你
To tell you the truth

21:54.550 --> 21:56.910
已经开始了
It's already started

21:56.920 --> 21:58.360
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

21:58.370 --> 21:59.940
你以为我想越狱
You think I want to break out of here?

21:59.950 --> 22:01.830
再过16个月我就出去了
6 months from now I'm at the gate.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.840
我要结婚了
I'm getting married,

22:02.850 --> 22:05.270
我可不想在婚礼时被警察捉回去
And not with no posse on my ass.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.700
伙计 我真想揍你
I oughta beat you six ways till Sunday.

22:07.710 --> 22:09.030
我失去了我的权利
I lost my conjugals

22:09.040 --> 22:10.630
就因为你的肥皂
Because of your little bar of soap.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.260
我必须先测试一下你会不会泄密
I had to see if you could keep a secret.

22:13.270 --> 22:14.500
你要秘密
You want a secret?

22:14.510 --> 22:16.310
我告诉你个秘密
I got a secret for you, fish

22:16.320 --> 22:18.140
你在我的牢房乱搞
You dig in my cell when I'm there

22:18.150 --> 22:20.640
我鸡巴都给你割了
I'm gonna split your wig.

22:20.650 --> 22:25.480
(西班牙语: 你的明白?)

22:29.460 --> 22:30.500
现在安逸了
That went well

22:38.200 --> 22:39.950
我们就从林肯和你男友的关系开始
Let's start with Lincoln's relationship with your boyfriend

22:39.960 --> 22:41.370
很简单
Well,simple.

22:41.380 --> 22:44.030
他欠我男友9万块钱 一直没法还清
He owed my man 90,000.He wasn't getting it done

22:44.040 --> 22:46.060
突然间他有钱了
All of a sudden, it gets done

22:46.070 --> 22:48.630
克拉勃 很高兴地拿着钱回来
Crab walks up with 90k and a big-ass smile

22:48.640 --> 22:49.640
谁给他的钱
Who paid him?

22:49.650 --> 22:51.520
不是林肯 有人帮他付的
Not Lincoln. They paid his marker.

22:51.530 --> 22:54.780
那些人是谁
Who's they?

22:54.790 --> 23:00.260
没事的 你现在很安全
It's all right, Leticia.I told you, you're safe here

23:00.330 --> 23:03.720
我在家里见过他一次 就一次
Crab brought this guy home.Never seen him before

23:03.730 --> 23:06.130
克拉勃 在做大生意的时候
Crab did what he always did

23:06.140 --> 23:09.020
总是叫我出去
He told me to take a walk,so that's exactly what I did

23:09.030 --> 23:10.100
关于那个男人
There was something about this guy

23:10.110 --> 23:13.160
不像是克拉勃经常来往的那种人
He wasn't the kind he usually dealt with.

23:13.170 --> 23:14.190
什么意思
What do you mean?

23:14.200 --> 23:17.030
他们似乎不可冒犯
Couldn't put my finger on it till he went outside

23:17.040 --> 23:18.170
我就知道
Then I knew

23:18.180 --> 23:19.350
有那种感觉
He had that look

23:19.360 --> 23:20.900
-怎样的感觉  -你知道
-What look?  -You know.

23:20.910 --> 23:22.510
就像他们是掌权的人
Like they own the place

23:22.520 --> 23:24.580
有一种权威的感觉
Like they're untouchable

23:24.590 --> 23:26.600
就像是政府的人
Like they're government.

23:26.610 --> 23:30.250
你说政府偿还了林肯的债务
So the government paid Lincoln's debt?

23:30.260 --> 23:33.540
克拉勃有没有说他们想交换什么
Did Crab say what they wanted in return?

23:33.550 --> 23:34.940
没
Uh-uh

23:34.950 --> 23:36.220
好吧
All right

23:36.230 --> 23:40.200
你等我一会把这些东西打好
Just give me a moment to type this up.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.840
-你去哪里  -抽根烟
-Where are you going?  -I'll have a smoke

23:41.850 --> 23:43.490
一分钟就好
This is only gonna take me a minute

23:43.500 --> 23:46.920
我也是
So will the smoke

23:49.170 --> 23:51.900
没有红肿说明没有发炎
No swelling, so there's no sign of infection

23:51.910 --> 23:55.140
再打十天抗生素
I'll keep you on antibiotics for ten days.

23:55.150 --> 23:58.700
你就会没事了
You should be good.

23:58.810 --> 24:00.640
迈克尔 你要明白
Michael .You will understand

24:00.650 --> 24:01.930
按照规矩 我要向上面报告
By law I must file a report

24:01.940 --> 24:04.840
如果我知道囚犯之间有些什么
If I feel there has been prisoner misconduct?

24:04.850 --> 24:06.120
这伤绝不可能是
There's no way this injury happened

24:06.130 --> 24:09.250
意外踏上一把除草剪刀造成的
By stepping on a blade in a garden shed.

24:09.260 --> 24:12.080
你报告上去 事情对我而言会变得更糟
If you file the report,things could get a lot worse.

24:12.090 --> 24:13.650
现在还不够糟
They're not already?

24:13.660 --> 24:17.040
比起他们能做的 这已经算好的了
Not compared to what they could be

24:17.050 --> 24:19.080
我有不少敌人
I've made some enemies

24:19.090 --> 24:21.210
嗯
Yeah

24:21.220 --> 24:25.030
害怕吗
You scared?

24:25.170 --> 24:27.820
好吧
Men. OK

24:27.830 --> 24:30.960
我想你肯定会害怕
Here's what I think. I think you are scared.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.560
如果不害怕那不正常
And you wouldn't be human

24:32.570 --> 24:36.010
在这样的地方
If you weren't scared in a place like this.

24:36.020 --> 24:39.090
我小的时候 晚上总是睡不着
When I was young, I couldn't sleep at night

24:39.100 --> 24:42.430
总觉得衣橱里有怪物在窥视我
Because I thought there was a monster in the closet

24:42.440 --> 24:43.800
我哥哥对我说
But my brother told me

24:43.810 --> 24:46.670
门后面什么也没有 只有你的恐惧
There wasn't anything in the closet but fear,

24:46.680 --> 24:49.480
那不是真实的
And fear wasn't real.

24:49.490 --> 24:50.590
恐惧没有形态
He said it wasn't made of anything.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.990
只是空气
It was just... air.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.690
他还说
Not even that

24:56.700 --> 24:58.260
你必须要面对它
He said you just have to face it

24:58.270 --> 25:02.340
打开那扇门 怪物就会消失不见
You just have to open that door,and the monster would disappear.

25:02.350 --> 25:04.510
你哥哥是一个聪明人
Your brother sounds like a smart man

25:04.520 --> 25:07.020
是的
He is.

25:07.030 --> 25:08.430
虽然在这里
In here, though

25:08.440 --> 25:12.290
你勇敢的打开了门
You face your fear, you open that door,

25:12.300 --> 25:15.780
但你发现后面还有一百扇门你要打开
And there's a hundred more doors behind it

25:15.790 --> 25:19.410
而且门后的怪物
And the monsters that are hiding behind them

25:19.420 --> 25:21.440
全部都是真实的
Are all real

25:21.450 --> 25:24.640
如果你愿意 我可以申请把你送去文书区
If you want,I could recommend you be sent to ad seg

25:24.650 --> 25:27.890
和一群强奸犯和小偷在一起
With the rape victims and the snitches.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.410
这样可以保证你的安全
It would keep you safe.

25:30.420 --> 25:32.060
谢谢
Thanks

25:32.070 --> 25:37.180
我宁愿自己面对那群怪物
but I think I'd like to face the monsters on my own

25:39.600 --> 25:41.620
抽完烟了
Have a good smoke?

25:41.630 --> 25:45.270
我不抽烟
I don't smoke

25:47.650 --> 25:49.990
希望没有吓到你
Didn't mean to startle you.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.820
我是 凯勒曼 探员 特情局的
Special Agent Kellerman, Secret Service.

25:53.830 --> 25:54.610
我们被告知
We've been informed that

25:54.620 --> 25:57.980
你得到了一份保安录像的复本
you obtained a copy of the surveillance tape

25:57.990 --> 26:00.700
是林肯布罗斯一案的重要证据
Entered as evidence in the Burrows trial.

26:00.710 --> 26:02.660
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem with that?

26:02.670 --> 26:03.950
我们只是来了解一下
 We're just following up

26:03.960 --> 26:06.460
是不是公共资料法有什么更改
Has there been an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act that

26:06.470 --> 26:10.300
我还不知道
I'm not aware of?

26:10.310 --> 26:11.700
你知道当一个死囚
When a prisoner gets

26:11.710 --> 26:14.070
即将行刑之前
close to the end of his time on death row

26:14.080 --> 26:15.060
总是有很多无谓的努力
There's a lot of last-minute...

26:15.070 --> 26:16.740
抱歉 我不明白
I'm sorry.I don't understand

26:16.750 --> 26:19.000
是什么引起特情局的关注
Why this would be a problem for the Secret Service

26:19.010 --> 26:20.100
没有
It's not

26:20.110 --> 26:23.690
只是这案子的判决绝对勿庸置疑
The prosecution made its case far beyond any reasonable doubt

26:23.700 --> 26:27.140
而我们清楚我们抓对了人
and we know that we have the right man

26:27.150 --> 26:30.060
不过 万一你有可能找到
That being said, if you come across anything

26:30.070 --> 26:33.660
证明犯人无罪的证据
That could shed some light on his innocence,

26:33.670 --> 26:36.940
-我们会全力提供协助  -听起来不错
-I'm offering my help.  -Sounds great

26:36.950 --> 26:41.860
感谢你特意告诉我这些
I really appreciate you coming by

26:43.050 --> 26:44.860
你有名片吗 凯勒曼 探员
Do you have a card, Agent Kellerman?

26:44.870 --> 26:47.510
当然
Of course.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.760
随时给我电话
Don't hesitate to call.

26:49.770 --> 26:53.650
当然
Thanks

27:00.980 --> 27:04.550
莱提莎
Leticia

27:30.630 --> 27:33.430
-塞巴斯蒂安 很抱歉  -你在哪里
-Sebastian, I'm so sorry.  -Where are you?

27:33.440 --> 27:35.170
对不起 现在不是时候
This isn't the time. I'm sorry

27:35.180 --> 27:37.570
已经是约定时间 我现在接待室
This is the time. I'm at the reception hall.

27:37.580 --> 27:39.350
中介来了
The coordinator is here

27:39.360 --> 27:41.050
卖家也到了
the vendors is too

27:41.060 --> 27:42.610
听着 我非常抱歉
Look, I-I'm just...I'm sorry

27:42.620 --> 27:46.510
现在不方便说话
I-I can't talk right now

28:03.220 --> 28:05.530
我们把他整条腿卸掉好了
I say we take his whole foot.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.750
我们可以把他的四肢都砍掉
We could cut off all his limbs

28:07.760 --> 28:11.350
但他还是不会说一个字
He still wouldn't talk

28:11.360 --> 28:14.830
痛苦有时不能解决问题
Pain is not the answer here.

28:14.840 --> 28:18.540
或者只有披头士乐队是对的
Maybe the Beatles were right after all

28:18.550 --> 28:23.620
我们需要的只是爱
Maybe all you need is love

28:24.530 --> 28:25.230
你在做什么
What are you doing?

28:25.240 --> 28:28.540
你觉得我在做什么 在收拾东西
What does it look like? I'm rolling it up

28:28.550 --> 28:29.790
你不能这样做
You can't do this

28:29.800 --> 28:32.070
我不会参与你的疯狂计划
I'm done with your reindeer games

28:32.080 --> 28:35.200
我要去一个普通的 正常的牢房
I'm gonna transfer to a nice,quiet cell with a normal cellie

28:35.210 --> 28:37.940
去一个不会把我毁掉的地方
One that doesn't screw my entire life up

28:37.950 --> 28:39.720
听着
Look

28:39.730 --> 28:41.720
对你失去权利我很抱歉
I'm sorry about your conjugals

28:41.730 --> 28:45.630
如果你现在离开
But if you go now...

28:46.210 --> 28:48.060
不要这样 拜托
Don't do this. Please

28:48.070 --> 28:49.430
听我说
Listen to me, fish.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.300
我只有16个月
I got 16 months

28:51.310 --> 28:53.290
我还有未婚妻在外面
I got a fiance to think about

28:53.300 --> 28:55.130
如果我做这样的事
I get caught with a hole in my wall

28:55.140 --> 28:58.530
我要再过五年才能看见外面的世界
I don't get to see the real world for another five years

28:58.540 --> 29:00.900
走吧 苏克雷
Let's go, Sucre

29:00.910 --> 29:02.130
我不会这样做
I can't do that

29:02.140 --> 29:05.150
凡事总有解决的办法 我们可以商量
There is a solution. We can work it out.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.670
对不起 小嫩鸡
Sorry, fish

29:14.010 --> 29:16.880
可以问个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

29:16.890 --> 29:17.750
你为何不愿意
Why have you denied

29:17.760 --> 29:21.070
让家人和至爱陪你走最后一程
 any family or loved ones to be there for you in the end?

29:21.080 --> 29:24.100
为何要让他们看着我死去
Why would I let them watch me die?

29:24.110 --> 29:26.520
我已经带来很多痛苦
I've caused them enough pain.

29:26.530 --> 29:31.140
也许并不是他们看着你死去
Maybe it's not about them watching you die.

29:31.150 --> 29:33.920
你意思是我看着他们好好活着
Maybe it's about me watching them live.

29:33.930 --> 29:37.070
-让我因此内心煎熬  -不是的
-That the final torture?  -No

29:37.080 --> 29:40.070
在你离开这个世界的时候
It's about how you want to leave this world.

29:40.080 --> 29:43.130
你希望最后带走怎样的影像
What's the last image you want to take with you?

29:43.140 --> 29:46.560
一个陌生人
A stranger?

29:59.600 --> 30:02.680
想对那边的小朋友做什么
Got an issue with our little friend over there?

30:02.690 --> 30:03.970
不需要你同意
You don't need consent

30:03.980 --> 30:05.290
这跟你没什么关系
You don't give the green light.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.500
这里的所有事情都需要我的同意
Everything in here runs through me.

30:07.510 --> 30:08.070
你知道的
You know that.

30:08.080 --> 30:12.500
梅·塔格 就是因为他才死了
May Tag's in the ground because of that piece of detritus

30:12.510 --> 30:13.880
所以你要他偿还
So now you want him

30:13.890 --> 30:17.840
用他剩下的每一天
Every day for the rest of his bid.

30:17.850 --> 30:23.300
似乎英雄所见略同
Seems you and I have something in common

30:27.250 --> 30:29.250
进去
Get in!

30:29.260 --> 30:32.620
放松点 小嫩鸡
Easy, now, fish

30:32.630 --> 30:35.360
不要让大家都不好过
Don't make this any harder than it needs to be

30:35.370 --> 30:37.510
下面我们将会有些安排
It's time we came to an arrangement

30:37.520 --> 30:42.780
你不反对吧
Don't you think?

30:52.000 --> 30:55.790
我在想怎样把你的内脏狠狠地取出
You know, I was thinking I was gonna gut you bow to stern

30:55.800 --> 30:57.680
就在我们眼神接触的瞬间
As soon as I laid eyes on you

30:57.690 --> 31:04.640
我想你痛苦的样子一定很漂亮 不是吗
But, alackaday, you look so pretty when you're scared, don't you?

31:04.650 --> 31:06.700
也是我爱的表达方式
I'll get the love out of the way

31:06.710 --> 31:07.760
爱到极点就是恨
Before the hate

31:07.770 --> 31:12.370
你觉得呢 帅哥
What do you say, pretty?

31:13.770 --> 31:18.870
也许是时候我们好好了解一下对方
Maybe it's time I lit up that leather once and for all, huh?

31:22.450 --> 31:26.150
鸟人废话是多
God, he talks too much.

31:26.160 --> 31:31.290
我们需要好好聊聊
You and I need to have a conversation.

31:39.690 --> 31:42.440
里面发生的事表明了我的态度
What happened in there was my way of saying

31:42.450 --> 31:48.820
之前我们有点小误会
I know I've been going about this whole thing the wrong way.

31:49.350 --> 31:52.280
我想表示一点歉意
I'm trying to make amends here

31:52.290 --> 31:55.360
过去的就过去了
Bygones be bygones

31:55.370 --> 31:57.550
你真善变啊 约翰
You're a mercurial man, John

31:57.560 --> 32:01.420
我更认为是有胆识
I prefer bold.

32:05.230 --> 32:07.200
说你想从我这里得到什么
Tell me what you need from me

32:07.210 --> 32:08.720
交易
A trade

32:08.730 --> 32:10.070
你给我飞机
You get me a plane

32:10.080 --> 32:12.370
我给你 菲波纳奇
And I'll get you Fibonacci

32:12.380 --> 32:14.520
你要飞机做什么
What do you need a plane for?

32:14.530 --> 32:16.830
我想你知道的
I think you know

32:16.840 --> 32:17.900
我帮你的话 我也搅进去了
I help you, I'm in

32:17.910 --> 32:20.130
你知道的 对吧
You know that, don't you?

32:20.140 --> 32:22.640
当然
I do

32:22.650 --> 32:25.470
我要知道准确的日期和时间
Just gotta know the exact date and time

32:25.480 --> 32:26.750
很快我会告诉你
I'll tell you soon enough

32:26.760 --> 32:27.910
迟则作废
Soon enough won't cut it

32:27.920 --> 32:31.190
在 菲波纳奇 作证之前
I need to be outside before Fibonacci testifies

32:31.200 --> 32:33.000
没问题
You will be

32:33.010 --> 32:35.000
只有不到一个月了
He testifies in one month

32:35.010 --> 32:37.650
还有很多时间
Then you'll be out in plenty of time

32:37.660 --> 32:43.480
如果做不到 你死定了
If not, you're a corpse

32:43.670 --> 32:45.190
长话短说
So cut the crap

32:45.200 --> 32:47.570
我要知道日期和时间
Tell me the exact date and time

32:47.580 --> 32:49.480
我才能安排
So I can start making the arrangements

32:49.490 --> 32:51.500
我还不确定是否应该相信你
I don't know if I can trust you yet

32:51.510 --> 32:51.970
为什么
Why not?

32:51.980 --> 32:56.870
我说过了 因为你很善变
Like I said, John, you're a mercurial man

33:04.400 --> 33:06.990
路易斯 把这些解开
Lewis, take these off

33:07.000 --> 33:08.500
我不能这样做
Sink, I can't do that

33:08.510 --> 33:10.440
伙计 我在牢里
Come on, man. I'm in a cage

33:10.450 --> 33:12.280
十分钟
Ten minutes

33:12.290 --> 33:14.800
求你
Please

33:14.810 --> 33:19.560
是我儿子
It's my kid

33:30.180 --> 33:34.230
我们又见面了
So, here we are

33:34.240 --> 33:36.400
是的
Yeah

33:36.410 --> 33:38.060
你怎么样阿
How you been?

33:38.070 --> 33:41.520
你知道的 有点麻烦
You know, in trouble.

33:41.530 --> 33:45.320
你妈妈呢
How's your mom?

33:45.850 --> 33:49.330
很好
She's good

33:49.710 --> 33:50.720
我跟牧师聊天
I've been talking to the chaplain

33:50.730 --> 33:53.160
他们要我决定谁 呃
They'd like me to decide on who I should have at the...

33:57.810 --> 34:00.670
我想说的是
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

34:00.680 --> 34:04.050
直到最后一刻 你才会意识到
When you get to the end,you start to realise

34:04.060 --> 34:06.910
什么是最重要的
What's important to you

34:06.920 --> 34:10.960
谁是无法取代的人
You know, who really matters to you.

34:10.970 --> 34:13.420
然后 你知道
And, you know

34:13.430 --> 34:15.780
我说的是你和迈克尔
That leaves you and Mike

34:15.790 --> 34:18.490
唯一与我有血缘关系的亲人
The only blood I got left in this...

34:18.500 --> 34:20.990
在这个世界上
this world

34:21.000 --> 34:21.900
我想说
Yeah, I gotta say

34:21.910 --> 34:24.620
我不是很懂你在说什么
I'm not really following what you're saying

34:24.630 --> 34:28.350
只是
Well, uh...

34:28.950 --> 34:30.560
到了最后
In the end

34:30.570 --> 34:34.500
我的心里只剩下爱
The only thing that matters is love

34:34.510 --> 34:40.520
血缘 家人 还有 你
Blood, family, you

34:53.620 --> 34:56.800
给我你的手
Um...Give me your hand

34:56.810 --> 34:58.640
你在做什么
What are you doing?

34:58.650 --> 35:01.750
给我你的手
Give me your hand

35:01.760 --> 35:05.940
你的手
Give me your hand

35:13.230 --> 35:16.640
我想你能来
I want you to be there when...

35:16.650 --> 35:21.710
在我行刑的那天
I want you to be there the day before I die.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.100
让我看见你
So I can see you.

35:24.110 --> 35:28.210
我可以抱抱你
So I can hold you.

35:33.200 --> 35:37.260
我
I...

35:37.440 --> 35:38.710
我爱你
I love you

35:38.720 --> 35:42.910
我一直都爱你
I've always loved you

35:50.090 --> 35:54.040
这一切
This whole thing...

35:55.550 --> 36:00.040
我不知能否能够承受
I don't know if I can take it

36:00.050 --> 36:02.550
我也是
Me either

36:02.560 --> 36:05.450
但我别无选择
I don't have a choice

36:05.460 --> 36:08.680
但你有
You do

36:29.530 --> 36:32.500
我很抱歉
I am so sorry

36:32.510 --> 36:33.820
今早我和一位女士会面
I met with this woman today

36:33.830 --> 36:36.750
她知道林肯案子的一些内情
And she knew things about Lincoln's case

36:36.760 --> 36:37.910
然后她就消失了
Then she just disappeared

36:37.920 --> 36:39.220
我想她出事了
I think something happened to her

36:39.230 --> 36:40.310
听着
Look.

36:40.320 --> 36:43.920
我尽量把话说得简单点
I'm gonna make this real easy for you

36:43.930 --> 36:46.650
你还想跟我结婚吗
Do you want to get married

36:46.660 --> 36:50.920
还是不想
Or not?

36:51.390 --> 36:53.700
