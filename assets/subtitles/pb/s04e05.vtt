00:07.560 --> 00:08.760

00:10.760 --> 00:13.360

00:17.120 --> 00:17.120


00:17.120 --> 00:17.120


00:17.120 --> 00:17.120


00:18.260 --> 00:20.600

00:25.700 --> 00:26.600
你没拿到锡拉

00:29.300 --> 00:32.400
似乎你的朋友惠斯勒不是唯一一个
It seems your friend Whistler wasn't the only one

00:32.410 --> 00:34.800
-想找锡拉的人  你知道这事吗  -不知道

我们尽可能的优化了图像
We refined the image the best we could,

01:12.360 --> 01:13.530
但是我们还是需要
but we're going to need

01:13.600 --> 01:15.130
你的专家们把图像做的更清晰
one of your specialists to sharpen the video

01:15.200 --> 01:16.900
这样我们才能辨认出其他人
so we can I.D. the rest of them.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.500
好的  我会尽力的
All right, I'll see what I can do.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.800
而且  我也见过那些技术人员能做什么
But I've seen what those tech guys are capable of.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.030
有时候他们只能...
Sometimes, it's...

01:23.130 --> 01:25.400
等一下  我认识这个人
Wait a sec, I know this guy.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.560
这个人和我在一个大楼工作
This guy works in my building.

01:26.630 --> 01:28.270

他是财政部洛杉矶分部的头

01:31.460 --> 01:33.400
既然他和你在一栋大楼里  你就能接近他了
Well, if he's in your building you can get close to him.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.900
-我需要一个理由  -那你就自己编一个吧
-I would need a reason. -Well, you make something up.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.900
就说阿凯达组织偷了很多债券
Something about Al Qaeda using stolen bearer bonds

01:38.960 --> 01:40.290
来资助地下活动  随便你
to finance shady operations, whatever.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.000
不是吧  编造虚假言论
Come on, making false claims

01:42.060 --> 01:43.700
损害政府威信
in matters affecting government?

01:43.760 --> 01:45.430
那可是要判五年刑的
That's up to five years in prison.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.700
欢迎成为我们的一员  赛尔夫探员
Welcome to the club, Agent Self.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.930
感谢你来见我
Thanks for meeting me.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.860
我一直想出来见你
I would have come out to see you,

02:17.930 --> 02:19.160
但是我不能走太远
but I can't travel that far...

02:19.230 --> 02:21.000
不好意思
I'm sorry...

02:21.060 --> 02:23.530
你说你有些照片要给我看
but you said that you had some pictures to show me.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.530
就是他
That's him.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.600
我会尽快和你联系
I'll get in touch with you

02:48.660 --> 02:51.000
一旦我...
as soon as...

02:51.060 --> 02:55.500
一旦我查出是谁干的
as soon as... I find out.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.630
不是你的错
You didn't do this.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.060
你其实一直是个好人
In your heart, you are a really good man.

03:08.130 --> 03:11.660
因此我嫁给你
That's why I married you.

03:11.730 --> 03:14.830
因此我和你成家
That's why I started a family with you.

03:22.630 --> 03:25.060
还记得你经常带着文件回家
Remember when you used to bring your files home

03:25.130 --> 03:29.960
我总是求你把那些东西留在办公室
and I would beg you to leave that stuff at work?

03:30.030 --> 03:33.030
但是当你看到了坏人
But when you have a monster in your sights...

03:35.060 --> 03:37.130
只有抓到他
you can't focus

03:37.200 --> 03:40.000
你才能在意你身边的人
until you get him.

03:40.060 --> 03:42.400
我以前很恨你那样
I used to hate that about you.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.760
现在只有一件事能安慰我自己
Right now it's the only thing that lets me sleep,

03:45.830 --> 03:47.800
那就是我相信
because I know...

03:47.860 --> 03:51.330
你会抓到凶手
you're going to get him.

《越狱》第四季 第五集
Prison.Break.S04E05

05:45.960 --> 05:47.860
你在干什么
What are you doing?

05:47.930 --> 05:49.360
你好啊 布伦尼
Hey there, Blauney.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.660
只是
Just, uh...

05:51.730 --> 05:52.630
做一些调查
doing a little research.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.300
关于伽特公司的
Gate-related?

05:54.360 --> 05:56.530
这样才更能让我发挥实力
I'm adding a little flourish to my pitch.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.100
我不能像笼中之鸟一样
"Like the caged macaw

05:58.160 --> 05:59.830
无法展翅翱翔
who cannot spread her wings."

05:59.900 --> 06:01.130
其实  科尔
You know, Cole...

06:01.200 --> 06:03.630
我一直在想你应该少花点时间空想
I was thinking maybe you should spend a little less time

06:03.700 --> 06:06.760
多花一点时间做点实事
practicing and a little more time actually pitching.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.700
我的意思是  世界第一的销售员
I mean, number one salesman in the world?

06:09.760 --> 06:11.160
我们一直盼望着
We're all just waiting with bated breath

06:11.230 --> 06:13.000
你能做点什么
to see what you can do around here.

06:20.860 --> 06:22.830
唉
Ouch.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.660
我知道
I know.

07:01.730 --> 07:03.860
我们看见了他在那里
We saw him right here.

07:05.630 --> 07:06.930
嘿
Hey.

07:07.030 --> 07:08.030
嘿
Hey.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.000
你见过莎拉吗
You haven't seen Sara, have you?

07:10.060 --> 07:11.700
没有
No.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.600
你想回福克斯河
You want to end up back in Fox River,

07:13.660 --> 07:15.600
就回去吧
you just go right ahead.

07:17.030 --> 07:18.700
嘿  怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

07:18.760 --> 07:20.560
-他想去找T-bag  -算你说对了
0He wants to look for T-Bag. -You're damn right.

07:20.630 --> 07:22.130
我就是要找他  我们知道他有那本书
I want to look for him.We know he's got the bird book.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.030
也知道那本书里写着打入内部的计划
We know the bird book's got the plan for the break-in.

07:24.100 --> 07:27.430
而且我们今天在这儿看见那个混蛋了
And we saw that snake right here today.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.930
我的意思是  我们是逃犯
All I'm saying is, it ain't safe

07:29.000 --> 07:31.900
所以  我们来找另外一个逃犯
for a member of the Fox River Eight to be out there looking

07:31.960 --> 07:34.730
-是非常不安全的  -没错  但是
-for another member of the Fox River Eight. -Yes, but...

07:34.800 --> 07:37.030
贝里克  你和苏克雷一起去
Bellick, I want you to go with Sucre,

07:37.100 --> 07:38.860
仔细查查这个地区  看看你能不能找到他的线索
canvass the area, see if you can get a lead on him.

07:38.930 --> 07:40.200
那里有六栋大楼
There are like six big buildings over there.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.630
他可能在任何一个里面
He could be in any one of them.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.260
所以我说仔细查查
That's why it's called canvassing.

07:50.730 --> 07:53.030
你知道吧  这可是在财政部里行动啊
You do realize this is the Treasury Department, right?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.800
你让赛尔夫下几层楼
You tell Self to go down a few floors,

07:54.860 --> 07:56.960
只要能看到那几台重要电脑
walk past the right computers

07:57.030 --> 07:58.360
我们就会变成大富翁了
and we are billionaires.

07:58.430 --> 07:59.600
拜托  我只要那张卡
Just the card, please.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.000
当·赛尔夫  国土安全局
Don Self, Homeland Security.

08:08.060 --> 08:09.660
-我需要马上与奥林先生会面  -他现在不在
-I need to see Mr. Oren right away. -He's not available.

08:09.730 --> 08:10.960
我需要马上见他
Ma'am, I need to see him

08:11.030 --> 08:12.660
否则的话  成千上万美国人
right away, otherwise hundreds of American lives

08:12.730 --> 08:14.100
的生命将会受到威胁
will be in jeopardy.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.600
当·赛尔夫  国土安全局
Don Self, Homeland Security.

08:16.660 --> 08:17.930
去和大厅里的安吉拉说
Talk to Angela down the hall.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.260
长官  对不起我闯了进来
Sir, I'm sorry to barge in here,

08:19.330 --> 08:20.330
但是这事很紧急
but this is urgent.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.660
我知道
I'm sure it is.

08:21.730 --> 08:23.200
去和大厅里的安吉拉说
Talk to Angela down the hall.

08:23.260 --> 08:25.030
长官  我们听说有一些债券被偷了
Sir,we are hearing chatter about some stolen bearer bonds,

08:25.100 --> 08:27.060
而且我们也相信这个事情和阿凯达组织有关
and we have reason to believe that Al Qaeda operatives...

08:27.130 --> 08:28.560
你有债券的号码吗
You have serial numbers?

08:28.630 --> 08:30.430
我没有
No, I do not.

08:39.130 --> 08:40.730
介意转过去吗
Mind turning around?

08:40.800 --> 08:43.100
不介意
Not at all.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.030
六小时后  我要去亚洲
I leave for Asia in six hours.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
他找到了
He's got it.

09:00.130 --> 09:01.760
在那之前
Until then...

09:01.830 --> 09:04.400
我要和几个部门主管开会
I've got meetings with the bureau chiefs

09:04.460 --> 09:06.830
包括联邦调查局  中情局  国土安全局
of the FBI, the CIA and Homeland Security.

09:07.960 --> 09:08.960
信号没了
It's gone.

09:10.430 --> 09:12.360
如果你现在告诉我的事情真的重要
If what you tell me is actually important,

09:12.430 --> 09:13.830
我会从你的上司那里知道
I'll hear about it from your boss.

09:13.900 --> 09:16.300
除非那样
Until then...

09:16.360 --> 09:18.560
否则一切事情去和大厅里的安吉拉说
talk to Angela down the hall.

09:18.630 --> 09:19.830
而且  你如果在没有我的允许下
And if you set foot

09:19.900 --> 09:21.960
再进入我的办公室
in my office again without my prior consent,

09:22.030 --> 09:23.960
我会让你在阿拉斯加
I will see to it that you spend the rest

09:24.030 --> 09:25.730
边防站呆到退休
of our career running border security in Alaska.

09:31.660 --> 09:33.030
拿到了吗
Did we get it?

09:33.100 --> 09:34.200
怎么了
What happened?

09:34.260 --> 09:35.430
什么怎么了
What do you mean what happened?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.560
只有几秒钟信号  然后就没了
We had it for two seconds and then it disappeared.

09:37.630 --> 09:39.600
一定是在保险箱里
It's in the safe.

09:39.660 --> 09:41.660
他办公室里有个超安全的保险箱
He has this crazy safe in his office.

09:41.730 --> 09:43.230
信号肯定是被保险箱屏蔽了
That must have been blocking the transmission.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.960
我确定卡就在那里放着
I'll bet you that's where he keeps the card.

09:45.030 --> 09:46.360
那我们就要想办法打开保险箱
So we need to get into that safe.

09:46.430 --> 09:47.930
相信我  绝对没办法打开的
Trust me, there's no way to crack that thing.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.830
过几个小时  我就会有其他持卡人
Look,I'll have the enhanced images of the other

09:49.900 --> 09:51.860
清晰的照片了  我们再从那里入手
cardholders in a couple of hours,we'll go from there.

09:51.930 --> 09:54.430
你能找到大楼的图纸  对吧
You can access the building's blueprints, right?

09:54.500 --> 09:55.800
我不能再回去了
I can't go back up there.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.860
没让你回去  我们来处理这个问题
No one's asking you. We'll take care of that.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.530
算了吧  你们连正门都进不去
Come on, you'll never get past the front door, okay?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.060
就算他们不认识你们
Even if they don't recognize you,

10:01.130 --> 10:03.100
你还要有出入的通行证  上面有...
you need a security card that matches...

10:03.160 --> 10:05.130
找到图纸  然后来找我  好吗
Get the blueprints and get back here, all right?

10:05.200 --> 10:06.200
好吧
Yeah...

10:07.930 --> 10:09.600
莎拉  出什么事了
Sara, what happened?

10:09.660 --> 10:11.430
我很好  但是有人跟踪我
I'm fine, but someone was following me.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.360
我在离这一英里左右的地方甩甩掉了他
I lost him about a mile back.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.330
我觉得他不可能跟着我到这里了
I don't think there's any way he could have

10:15.400 --> 10:17.160
-我很确定  -他长什么样子
-followed me here.I made sure of that. -What'd he look like?

10:17.230 --> 10:19.300
很高  黑人  还有胡子
Uh, tall, black. He had a beard.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.800
是这个人吗
Is this the guy?

10:23.430 --> 10:24.430
是的
Yeah.

10:25.930 --> 10:27.730
这是谁
Who's that?

10:27.800 --> 10:32.230
是他杀了我儿子
That's the man who killed my son.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.230
现在冲着我们来了
Now he's coming to kill us.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.520
你第一次是在哪里看见的他
Where were you the first time that you saw him?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.420
第一次
The very first time?

10:45.480 --> 10:46.680
回家的时候
Walking home.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.350
他有没有在街上和你打招呼
He didn't just run into you on the street?

10:48.420 --> 10:50.350
那你之前在哪里
Where were you before that?

10:50.420 --> 10:53.050
提朗格
The Towne Lounge.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.480
是不是酒吧
Is that a bar?

10:54.550 --> 10:56.550
有什么问题吗
Do you have a problem with that?

10:56.620 --> 11:00.780
不是  我只是想知道你在那里待了多长时间
No, I just want to know how long you were there.

11:00.850 --> 11:02.820
莎拉
Sara,

11:02.880 --> 11:05.350
我要找到这个人  而且我需要你的帮助
I need to find this guy and I can't do it without your help.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.520
我不管你为什么要去那个酒吧  或者你干了什么
I don't care why or what you were doing in the bar.

11:07.580 --> 11:09.280
我就是想知道你在那里待了多长时间
I just really want to know how long you were there.

11:09.350 --> 11:10.880
好吧  几个小时
Okay. A couple hours.

11:10.950 --> 11:14.480
谢谢你  他肯定留下了什么蛛丝马迹
Thank you. So something must have tipped him off.

11:14.550 --> 11:15.650
你付的是现金  对吗
You paid cash, right?

11:15.720 --> 11:17.720
当然了
Of course.

11:17.780 --> 11:19.950
但是布鲁斯给我的信用卡没了
But the credit card that Bruce gave me is gone.

11:20.020 --> 11:23.050
什么信用卡
What credit card?

11:25.650 --> 11:27.220
这些是安全检查点
These are the security checkpoints.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.150
如果你没有这个  你一处也过不去
You can't get past one of those unless you have one of these.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.480
我们能不能伪造几个
Any way we can forge it?

11:31.550 --> 11:33.680
当然了  如果你有两个星期
Sure, if you have two weeks and access

11:33.750 --> 11:35.680
并且能进入大楼的主机
to the building's mainframe maybe.

11:35.750 --> 11:38.050
好像十楼没有
Well, doesn't look like there are any security checkpoints

11:38.120 --> 11:40.050
-安全检查点  -是的
-on the tenth floor. -No, just that

11:40.120 --> 11:42.550
只有能到十楼的几个地方有
all the access points to the tenth floor.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.080
但是  如果你能神奇的
But if you could somehow magically appear

11:44.150 --> 11:46.220
出现在大厅的中间  你就安全了
and wind up in the middle of the hallway, you'd be fine,

11:46.280 --> 11:48.050
不过那里到处都是政府官员
except for all the government officials who'd be swarming

11:48.120 --> 11:49.750
他们一眨眼就能把你抓住
around and who would arrest you in a heartbeat.

11:49.820 --> 11:51.720
如果你把我们带到停车场
And if you can get us into the parking structure,

11:51.780 --> 11:52.750
保安会查我们的车吗
will security check our van?

11:52.820 --> 11:55.150
当然了  车里可以藏罪犯  为什么不查
Sure. Transporting known felons, why not?

11:55.220 --> 11:56.750
那么  停车场
So, the parking garage.

11:56.820 --> 11:58.350
就是我们进去的地方
This is our point of entry.

11:58.420 --> 11:59.980
我们需要关于保险箱的细节
We need the details to the safe.

12:02.520 --> 12:09.120
有一个徽章在保险箱上面
Okay, the, um, the safe has an insignia on it.

12:09.180 --> 12:11.550
看起来和这个很像
It looks something like this.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.550
你要用点这个
You're gonna need some of this.

12:41.980 --> 12:45.680
我在洛杉矶找到了莎拉·唐克雷蒂
I got a positive ID of Sara Tancredi in Los Angeles.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.080
这意味着迈克尔·斯科菲尔德也在
That means Michael Scofield was here.

12:47.150 --> 12:51.820
还有林肯·布鲁斯  为什么
That means Lincoln Burrows is here. Why?

12:51.880 --> 12:53.850
莎拉  是吧
Sara, huh?

12:53.920 --> 12:57.580
她就是一个狡猾的小贱人
She's a slippery little bitch, isn't she?

12:58.820 --> 13:02.550
你没什么时间耍滑头了  格雷琴
Time is not on your side, Gretchen.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.220
可能你一直没注意
Maybe you hadn't noticed,

13:06.280 --> 13:08.750
既然你可以一直
but since you seem to be somewhat immune

13:08.820 --> 13:11.780
抵抗对你身体的折磨
to physical coercion,

13:11.850 --> 13:14.550
我们决定换个方式
we've decided to move on.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.950
鼻子是一个进化的奇迹
The nose is an evolutionary marvel.

13:21.020 --> 13:25.250
我们的大脑会告诉我们
Our brain has been constructed so that certain aromas...

13:26.950 --> 13:31.880
咖啡豆  蓝莓的气味对我们的身体是有益的
...coffee beans, blueberries that are helpful to our body,

13:31.950 --> 13:33.680
我们可以感觉到这些东西是令人舒适的
we perceive as pleasant.

13:33.750 --> 13:37.580
相反的  有一些气味以为着死亡
Whereas other smells that signify death,

13:37.650 --> 13:41.520
疾病
disease.

13:41.580 --> 13:44.350
开始的症状有恶心  头晕
Initial symptoms include nausea, dizziness,

13:44.420 --> 13:48.650
红眼  所有你现在所感受到的
burning eyes, all of which you are experiencing right now.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.580
如果长时间接近会造成眩晕
Prolonged exposure will lead to faintness,

13:51.650 --> 13:53.820
快速的失去意识
rapid degradation of your mental faculties.

13:56.220 --> 13:57.250
告诉我
Tell me.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.150
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything.

14:02.250 --> 14:05.180
再给你一天时间
You've got one more day.

14:23.820 --> 14:26.450
上等货色
Top of the line.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.880
根据生理特征设计
It's a biometric design,

14:27.950 --> 14:30.220
而且只有奥林的指纹可以打开
and only Oren's fingerprint will open it.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.450
那我们就从他碰过的东西上取下他的指纹
So we lift his prints off something he touched.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.480
触摸器知道皮肤触摸的感觉
The pad knows what human skin feels like.

14:35.550 --> 14:37.980
如果我们骗它  它就会拉响警报
If we try to trick it, we'll set off the alarm.

14:38.050 --> 14:39.980
而且还有12位的密码设计
And then there's the 12-digit key code.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.250
那铰链呢
What about the hinges?

14:41.320 --> 14:42.250
链接着警报
Wired to the alarm.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.680
那我们就钻吧
We drill it.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.750
可能可以从金属的外层钻
Through the outer layer of steel maybe,

14:45.820 --> 14:47.450
但是这个东西是由7.5英寸厚
but the bones of this thing are three-quarters inch

14:47.520 --> 14:48.920
钴合金做成的
of cobalt alloy hard plate.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.480
我们没时间用钻的方法
Drilling's not gonna work, not in our timeframe.

14:51.550 --> 14:53.280
简单来说  我们有办法进入停车场
All right, so basically, we have a way to get you

14:53.350 --> 14:55.420
但是你们别忘了
into the garage, which, in case you guys forgot,

14:55.480 --> 14:57.420
这样的话会给我多加四项罪名
that puts me on the hook for another four charges.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.720
而且你们还没有办法到十楼
But no way to get you up to the tenth floor.

14:59.780 --> 15:01.580
就算你们到十楼了
But let's say you do get up to the tenth floor.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.880
你们还要在光天化日之下  在奥林的办公室里
Then we need to get you into Oren's office for an hour

15:03.950 --> 15:05.020
待一个小时
during the middle of the day.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.020
接着我们就要期盼
Then, we need to hope

15:07.080 --> 15:08.480
奥林的同事不会听到
that not one of Oren's co-workers is gonna hear

15:08.550 --> 15:10.350
因为要打开保险箱使用的
the extremely loud drill that you're gonna be using

15:10.420 --> 15:12.580
巨大的钻机的声音
to break into a safe that I'm telling you

15:12.650 --> 15:14.020
而且这个保险箱我们是不可能打开的
cannot be broken into.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.720
你知不知道  还有
Do you understand there are Homeland agents

15:15.780 --> 15:18.050
由安全局的探员设计的保安措施
whose sole job is to design safety measures

15:18.120 --> 15:20.220
以确保这个地方是坚不可摧的
to make this structure impregnable.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.350
以前在福克斯河也是这样
Yeah. They had those guys Fox River, too.

15:25.580 --> 15:26.550
这个办公室是谁的
Whose office is this?

15:26.620 --> 15:28.750
山姆·米尔顿  司法部的
Sam Middleton, Department of Justice.

15:28.820 --> 15:31.280
这面墙正好在米尔顿和沃勒的中间
This wall separates Middleton from Warren.

15:31.350 --> 15:34.420
我需要一些工具
I'm gonna need some supplies.

15:36.420 --> 15:39.280
信用卡在10点32分的时候在酒吧用过
The credit card was used at the bar at 10:32.

15:39.350 --> 15:40.650
你什么时候看到他的
What time did you see him?

15:40.720 --> 15:41.880
大概11点的时候
About 11:00.

15:41.950 --> 15:43.580
你当时走了多长时间了
And how long were you walking at that time?

15:43.650 --> 15:45.280
10 15分钟
Ten, 15 minutes.

15:45.350 --> 15:48.780
我们假设他在家接到了电话
Let's assume that he was at his place when we received the call.

15:48.850 --> 15:51.680
开车18分钟
That's an 18-minute drive

15:51.750 --> 15:53.880
才能到圣佩德罗的提朗格酒吧
from the Towne Lounge Bar in San Pedro.

15:53.950 --> 15:55.880
如果按平均30英里每小时计算
Averaging 30 miles an hour the whole way,

15:55.950 --> 15:58.450
大概就是9英里的范围
that's a, that's a nine-mile radius.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.120
那他就是在这个圈里
So he's gonna be somewhere around the perimeter of that circle.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.120
他肯定是在高速公路附近
He's got to be mobile

16:02.180 --> 16:04.080
半英里以内的地方
within a half mile of a major freeway.

16:04.150 --> 16:06.450
10号  110号  405号
The 10, the 110, the 405.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.020
没有固定住址  那我们就找旅店  对吗
No permanent address, so we're looking for hotels, right?

16:09.080 --> 16:11.220
对  不要找帮客人停车的旅店
Yeah, but nowhere where you need to valet your car.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.250
因为他要随时使用汽车
It's got to be readily accessible at all times.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.780
而且  不要找
And somewhere you don't need

16:14.850 --> 16:17.080
用信用卡付钱的地方  明白吗
to put a credit card down for incidentals. You got that?

16:17.150 --> 16:18.920
我看看我能不能找到
I'll see what I can do.

16:18.980 --> 16:20.480
快点
Hurry.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.620
崔什娜  我要一杯柠檬茶
Trishanne, I'm gonna need a mug of tea with lemon.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.150
抱歉  科尔  我现在走不开
I'm sorry, Cole. I can't leave the desk right now.

16:33.020 --> 16:36.650
好帮手还真难找
Good help is so hard to find.

16:42.220 --> 16:43.820
有什么可以效劳的吗
May I help you?

16:43.880 --> 16:45.120
我们是高谷保险的人
We're with Upper Valley Insurance.

16:45.180 --> 16:48.920
这人继承了一份10万美金的遗产
And this man just came into a $100,000 inheritance.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.920
我们找不到他  所以现在提供
We can't track him down, so we're offering

16:50.980 --> 16:52.920
百分之十的费用
a ten percent finder's fee

16:52.980 --> 16:54.980
给提供线索的人
to anyone who can point us in his direction.

16:55.050 --> 16:58.020
天啊  什么  1万美金
Oh, my gosh. What, $10,000?

16:58.080 --> 16:58.880
对
Yeah.

17:12.820 --> 17:15.850
抱歉  我不认识他
I'm sorry. I don't recognize him.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.880
好的  如果你见到他  麻烦打电话给我们
Okay,so if you do see him,would you please give us a call?

17:21.220 --> 17:22.280
谢谢
Thank you.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.520
伽特
"GATE"?

17:25.580 --> 17:27.480
成功通向卓越
"Greatness Achieved Through Excellence."

17:46.280 --> 17:47.880
做玩具吗
A toy?

17:47.950 --> 17:49.580
你能解释下吗
You want to try to explain this?

17:49.650 --> 17:51.820
铝粉和氧化铁的混合物
Mix aluminum powder with iron oxide.

17:51.880 --> 17:52.920
加热
Add a little heat.

17:57.020 --> 17:59.880
喂  谢谢你回电话  山姆
Hey. Yeah, well, thanks for calling me back, Sam.

18:02.350 --> 18:05.250
不  我知道你安排了庭审
Yeah. No,I just,I know you have these trial dates coming up

18:05.320 --> 18:07.380
我们只是想确认你们有确凿的证据
and we just want to make sure you have everything

18:07.450 --> 18:09.680
给这帮混蛋定罪
you need to convict these bastards.

18:09.780 --> 18:13.450
太好了
Okay, that's terrific.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.350
好的  待会见
All right, I'll see you then.

18:15.420 --> 18:16.950
好的
All right,

18:17.020 --> 18:18.350
我们约好吃午餐
we're gonna have lunch.

18:18.420 --> 18:20.120
我会尽量拖延他
I'll keep him out of his office for as long as I can.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.920
祝你好运
Good luck.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.420
好的
All right.

18:30.950 --> 18:32.820
-喂  -有他的消息吗
-Hello. -Hey, any sign of him?

18:32.880 --> 18:34.320
没有  我们查了10栋楼了
No, we checked about ten buildings,

18:34.380 --> 18:35.680
但没发现什么
but nothing so far.

18:35.750 --> 18:37.820
算了吧  我们要找下一张卡
Well, scrap it; we're going after the next card.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.320
在圣摩尼卡和西世纪街角等我
Meet me on the corner of Santa Monica and Century West.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.650
你好  查理
Hey, Charlie.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.920
美国队昨晚又输了
Yankees lost again last night.

18:58.980 --> 19:00.880
对  至少粉丝们在
Yeah, well, at least our fans show up

19:00.950 --> 19:02.450
第5局前到了  对不对
before the fifth inning, right?

19:02.520 --> 19:03.850
祝你愉快  查理
Have a good day, all right, Charlie?

19:03.920 --> 19:05.480
你也是  赛尔夫先生
You, too, Mr. Self.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.750
我跟你们说清楚
I'm letting you guys know right now.

19:24.820 --> 19:26.480
你们要是被抓了  别提我的名字
If you get buzzy,don't mention my name.

19:41.220 --> 19:42.720
准备好了
We're ready.

20:11.980 --> 20:13.920
开始
Now.

20:17.920 --> 20:18.950
1  2  3
One, two, three.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.520
嗨
So...

20:28.580 --> 20:31.950
两个邋遢鬼来过
a couple of scruffy guys walk in,

20:32.020 --> 20:34.520
说他们是保险公司的
tell me they're from the insurance company

20:34.580 --> 20:39.820
如果我说出你的下落  他们就给我1万美金
and they offer me $10,000 if I know where you are.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.450
直觉告诉我
Something tells me

20:41.520 --> 20:43.220
这里有更高的报酬
there's a better offer on the table.

20:44.750 --> 20:45.880
当然  崔什娜
Well, I'll be, Trishanne.

20:45.950 --> 20:47.880
你刚刚抓了个小精灵
You just caught yourself a leprechaun.

20:47.950 --> 20:49.580
就像传说那样
And as the legend goes,

20:49.650 --> 20:52.420
你能实现一个愿望  任何愿望
you got yourself one wish, anything in the world.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.280
是吗
Oh, really?

20:53.350 --> 20:54.720
我会帮你实现
And I am bound to grant it.

20:54.780 --> 20:56.480
-是吗  -恩
-Yeah? -Mm-hmm.

20:56.550 --> 20:59.250
你的分红支票还在我台面
Well, your commencement check's sitting on my desk

20:59.320 --> 21:00.750
等你签收
waiting to be signed.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.550
这倒是个不错的报酬
That's a pretty nice pot of gold.

21:02.620 --> 21:06.180
在你开口前...
Before you say another word...

21:06.250 --> 21:08.180
告诉你
Now, it's true

21:08.250 --> 21:11.050
精灵不会拒绝捕获者的要求
leprechauns cannot refuse their captor's demands,

21:11.120 --> 21:13.380
但一旦他们认为
but if they deem her

21:13.450 --> 21:15.520
她是个贪婪之徒
to be greedy or covetous,

21:15.580 --> 21:18.950
不管她要求什么  都会伴随着
whatever she desires will certainly be accompanied

21:19.020 --> 21:21.720
可怕的诅咒
with disastrous tidings.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.480
这也是传说
Or so the legend goes.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.850
只要分红的百分之三
Three percent of your commission

21:30.920 --> 21:33.050
然后一笔勾销
from here on out.

21:34.450 --> 21:36.720
成交
Done.

21:42.950 --> 21:44.480
当·赛尔夫来找你
Don Self to see you.

21:45.950 --> 21:47.220
你可以进去了
You can go right on in.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.580
-谢谢  祝您愉快  -你也是
-Thank you. Have a great day. -You too.

21:53.620 --> 21:54.750
嘿  山姆
Hey, Sam.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.750
很高兴见到你
Great to meet you.

21:56.820 --> 21:57.780
我也是
Same here.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.420
谢谢你能临时
Oh, thanks again for squeezing me in

21:59.480 --> 22:00.450
挤出时间给我
on such short notice.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.620
我想我们倒是
I figure we had so much

22:01.680 --> 22:03.820
还有很多时间  这是最好的办法
to get through, this'd be the best way.

22:05.480 --> 22:06.780
我以为我们出去吃
I-I thought we were going out for lunch.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.550
有问题吗
Is there a problem?

22:11.180 --> 22:12.120
实际上...
actually, um...

22:12.180 --> 22:13.180
我是吃素的
I'm a vegetarian.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.120
新的减肥食谱  不过楼下
It's a new diet, b-b-but there's

22:15.180 --> 22:16.920
倒是有个不错的地方
a great place down the street,

22:16.980 --> 22:18.620
我请客
and it'll be my treat.

22:20.020 --> 22:20.950
伊利斯
Elise.

22:21.020 --> 22:21.950
是  先生
Yes, sir?

22:22.020 --> 22:23.880
我出去吃饭
I'm heading out for lunch.

22:49.180 --> 22:51.320
抓好
Hold it there.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.820
不好意思  我想取些
Sorry, I was just coming in to...

22:56.880 --> 22:59.280
女洗手间没有手纸了
There's no more TP in the ladies room.

22:59.350 --> 23:00.550
我们一会就送去
We'll get right on that.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.580

这是这里最好的了
Best we got in here.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.950

23:55.450 --> 23:57.080
你知道我刚才
You know I read, I read this article

23:57.150 --> 23:58.380
看了一篇文章
a little while ago, right?

23:58.450 --> 24:01.450
讲的是先天所有和后天培养的关系
About the whole, uh, nature versus nurture thing,

24:01.520 --> 24:04.550
每个人之所以生得不同
and it turns out, it's all kind of a mishmash

24:04.620 --> 24:06.320
是因为DNA早就决定了一切
because DNA trumps everything.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.550
我很信这个
And I believe it, because

24:09.620 --> 24:12.080
因为我和我哥我姐生在同样的家庭
I mean, I grew up in the same house,

24:12.150 --> 24:14.080
我和我哥上同样的学校
uh, went to the same school as my brother,

24:14.150 --> 24:15.750
他现在是数学系教授

24:15.820 --> 24:17.120
我姐也是个儿科医生

24:17.180 --> 24:19.020
我却是个贼
And I'm a thief who blows his money

24:19.080 --> 24:21.150
把钱都花在妓女身上了
on hookers and coke.

24:21.220 --> 24:23.620
同样  斯科菲尔德是天才
So, like the same way Scofield's hardwired to be a genius,

24:23.680 --> 24:26.120
你生来就是执法的
and you are always gonna be a lawman, right?

24:26.180 --> 24:27.450
我想说的是  无论是谁
I mean, whoever this guy is,

24:27.520 --> 24:29.920
都不想变成杀人犯吧
you think he wanted to grow up to be a murderer?

24:29.980 --> 24:31.920
不会吧
Probably not.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.550
说话小心点
Be very careful choosing the next words

24:34.620 --> 24:36.080
别张嘴就来
that come out of your mouth.

24:41.580 --> 24:44.320
我只是想说
I... I'm just saying.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.320

25:09.220 --> 25:10.580
我们要妨碍到你了
but we're gonna be in your way

25:10.650 --> 25:12.380
大概得弄一个半小时
for the next 90 minutes or so.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.350
-布莱克  -来了
-Black? -Yeah.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.750
不好意思  女士
Excuse me, ma'am,

25:16.820 --> 25:18.750
有没有插座
but where can I plug in?

25:18.820 --> 25:20.250
你现在可以用办公室里的
For now, you can go in there,

我的铝热剂也准备好了
I'll have the thermite ready.

26:35.820 --> 26:36.880

26:36.950 --> 26:38.920
你这样多久了
How long has it been happening?

26:38.980 --> 26:40.680
小事一桩
It's not a big deal.

26:40.750 --> 26:41.780
你13岁的时候这可不是什么小事
It was a big deal when you were 13.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.580

之后看到他经过

我所不明白的是为什么
What I don't understand is why?

38:18.120 --> 38:19.880
那些持卡人
I mean, so far all the cardholders

38:19.950 --> 38:21.420
都是他们所在领域的专家
have been experts in their fields, right?

38:21.480 --> 38:22.880
无论是在能源方面  物流方面
In-in energy, and logistics,

38:22.950 --> 38:24.880
还是金融方面
and finance.

38:24.950 --> 38:26.480
我是说  他们看起来
I mean, it looks like

38:26.550 --> 38:28.480
想要摧毁这个国家
they're trying to tear the country down.

38:28.550 --> 38:31.480
然后通过重建来获取利益
And then they profit by rebuilding it.

38:31.550 --> 38:33.520
所以问题是  接下里会是什么
So the question is: what's next?

38:38.120 --> 38:40.450
几天前我在一个酒吧里
I was at a bar earlier.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.050
我没有喝酒  也没有发生任何的事情
And nothing happened, and I didn't drink.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.780
听着  如果这让你很难受
But... Look, if-if this is too much for you...

38:45.850 --> 38:47.250
不  不
No. No.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.650
那么我们忘了它好了
Because, say the word, and we'll scrap the whole thing.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.080
我答应你  以后不会再发生了
That's a promise. It's not going to happen again.

38:51.150 --> 38:55.220
如果我不和你说的话  那么这就是一个谎言了
But it would be a lie not to tell you, and I...

38:55.280 --> 38:57.920
我想你知道  我永远也不会欺骗你
want you to know that I'll never lie to you.

39:01.220 --> 39:02.720
对不起
I'm sorry.

39:17.220 --> 39:18.880
有人找你
Somebody's here for you.

39:18.950 --> 39:20.880
找我
For me?

39:24.850 --> 39:26.850

Cole Pfeiffer.

39:31.050 --> 39:33.650
你是星
Is your name Xing?

39:33.720 --> 39:36.780
星先生还呆在纽约
Mr. Xing stayed behind in New York.

39:38.850 --> 39:40.780
那么请坐吧
Well, have a seat then, uh--

39:40.850 --> 39:42.680
有什么可以为您效劳的
What can I help you with?

39:46.150 --> 39:48.680
你本该在两天之前交货的
You were supposed to deliver the item two days ago.

39:49.750 --> 39:50.680
东西在哪里
Where is it?

39:50.750 --> 39:52.620
什么在哪里啊
Where's what?

39:52.680 --> 39:54.680
我赶很远的路过来的  普发先生
I've traveled a long way, Mr. Pfeiffer.

39:54.750 --> 39:56.720
我的忍耐是有限度的
My patience is wearing thin.

39:56.780 --> 39:59.880
耍小把戏对我们都没有好处
Playing games is not going to be good for either of us.

39:59.950 --> 40:02.380
锡拉在哪里
Scylla. Where is it?

40:06.250 --> 40:07.520
普发先生  我现在在工作
Mr. Pfeiffer? I'm at work.

40:07.580 --> 40:09.650
我没有多余的时间和你交谈
It's not exactly like I can talk freely, you know.

40:09.720 --> 40:11.320
我直接进入主题吧
Just-just tell me the latest.

40:11.380 --> 40:12.350
主题 对吗
The latest?

40:12.420 --> 40:13.350
如果你在截止日期之前
If you deliver it

40:13.420 --> 40:15.880
把东西交给我
to me by the end of the day,

40:15.950 --> 40:18.780
我会按我们约好的金额付款给你
I will pay you the sum that we agreed upon.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.050
我想告诉你这有可能
As much as I'd like to tell you that were possible...

40:21.120 --> 40:22.380
如果你明天给我
Get it to me by tomorrow

40:22.450 --> 40:24.020

这就是主题
That is the latest.

40:33.780 --> 40:35.750
没问题
No problem.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.480
看起来这些尿不新鲜了
I thought that urine might be getting a little stale.

41:10.550 --> 41:12.520
所以我给你带了一些新的来
So I brought you some more.

41:53.120 --> 41:55.420

Hey, the image enhancement for the video came back.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.450

Did you get what I sent over?

41:57.520 --> 41:58.580
三位持卡人吗
All three cardholders?

41:58.650 --> 41:59.950
是的  前面两位持卡人
Yeah, well, for the first two,

42:00.020 --> 42:01.280

但我们得不到任何有关将军的资料
But for the General... we got nothing.

42:15.580 --> 42:17.350
这个家伙像石头里蹦出来的一样
This guy's a ghost.

42:21.350 --> 42:23.320
你还好吧
You all right?

42:29.250 --> 42:32.680
在巴拿马发生的大部分事情  我都不太清楚
Look,most of what happened to me in Panama is a total blank.

42:32.750 --> 42:33.920
但
But, um,

42:33.980 --> 42:35.520
当我被挟持的时候
when I was being held, I could hear

42:35.580 --> 42:36.820
我隐约听到格雷琴在隔壁讲电话
Gretchen talking on the phone, in the next room.

42:36.880 --> 42:37.850
她在接受
And she was taking orders

42:37.920 --> 42:39.620
老大的指令
from the guy in charge.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.680
她称他为将军
And she called him the General.

42:41.750 --> 42:43.380
任务的指挥者吗
In charge of the mission?

42:43.450 --> 42:45.720
不  我认为是公司的大老板
No, I think in charge of the Company.

42:50.220 --> 42:52.620
我早告诉过你
I told you...

42:52.680 --> 42:54.120
有机会时我们就应该杀了格雷琴
we should have killed Gretchen when we had the chance.

42:56.780 --> 42:59.020
她会回来的
She'll come home.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.320
她一直如此
She always has.

43:01.380 --> 43:03.280
希望你是对的
You better be sure about that.

43:03.350 --> 43:05.280
打扰一下
Excuse me, sir?

43:05.350 --> 43:07.280

We couldn't tell where the original picture...

43:13.050 --> 43:13.780
