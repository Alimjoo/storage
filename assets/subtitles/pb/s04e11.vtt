我搞砸了
I messed up.

00:06.530 --> 00:08.960

墙体用钢纤维强化过
The wall itself is fortified with steel fiber.

00:22.430 --> 00:24.430
坏消息是  里面有重量
The bad news is that there are both weight

00:24.430 --> 00:26.100
和扩音传感器
and microphonic sensors

00:26.100 --> 00:27.170
一旦有任何超过
that will alert Company security

00:27.170 --> 00:30.270
2磅的活人出现
to the presence of any breathing human being

00:30.270 --> 00:31.930
就会拉响"公司"的安全警报
that weighs more than two pounds.

00:31.930 --> 00:33.570
迈克
Mike.

00:33.570 --> 00:34.900
你长了个下丘脑错构瘤
You have a hypothalamus hamartoma,

00:34.900 --> 00:37.630
医生认为你得动手术

00:37.630 --> 00:39.800

Two days. No, tomorrow.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.300

再钻进一点点
Just a little bit more.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.270
慢点
Go slow.

02:08.230 --> 02:10.570
不  他绝对不值得我这么做
No, there's no way he deserves any of this.

02:10.570 --> 02:12.030
随你说吧  美女
Sing it, sister.

02:12.030 --> 02:13.130
他让我吃了那么多苦
After what he put me through?

02:13.130 --> 02:14.930
我自己也不敢相信
I can hardly believe it myself.

02:14.930 --> 02:16.430
我们必须要做的是
Look, what we must do is

02:16.430 --> 02:19.030
你好好色诱一下他
make sure that cosmic justice rains down upon him,

02:19.030 --> 02:21.870
一旦我们拿到将军的卡
for once we obtain the good general's card,

02:21.870 --> 02:22.970
我们就可以轻松拿到
there ain't hardly nothing standing

02:22.970 --> 02:24.470
冯给我们的

02:24.470 --> 02:27.230

02:34.230 --> 02:36.300
只管拿好照相机吧
Just keep both hands on the camera.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.770

Let's go.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.330
好极了
That's great.

02:53.130 --> 02:55.370

Yeah, he can see you today at 3:00.

02:57.270 --> 02:59.130
-不  -我们必须去
No. We're going.

02:59.130 --> 03:01.570
我们得有始有终
We need to finish what we started.

03:01.570 --> 03:02.570
我们可以去办
We can do this.

03:02.570 --> 03:04.830
我只要一天

03:06.300 --> 03:08.770
迈克尔  马尔登医生今天就能见你
Michael, Dr. Malden can see you today.

03:08.770 --> 03:12.070
他向我们保证他不会报警
He's given us his word he won't alert the authorities.

03:12.070 --> 03:14.470
如果你不去  你再出事的话
If you put this off and you, you collapse,

03:14.470 --> 03:16.230
到时会是别的医生为你治疗
you're going to be treated by another doctor.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.600
你想碰运气
Do you want to roll the dice

03:17.600 --> 03:19.300
看其他医生会不会报警吗
that they're not going to call the cops?

03:19.300 --> 03:23.270
还有好多事情没做
There's still so much to do.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.430
好吧
All right.

03:36.430 --> 03:38.200
3点
Three o'clock?

03:41.530 --> 03:44.430
我上一次钻墙
Last time I drilled  a hole in the wall,

03:44.430 --> 03:47.370
是在福克斯河监狱  跟迈克尔用打蛋器钻
it was with an eggbeater back in Fox River with Michael.

03:47.370 --> 03:51.130
真不敢相信  一切就快结束了
I just can't believe it's all coming to an end,

03:51.130 --> 03:53.870
但他却不在这里
and he's not here.

03:53.870 --> 03:55.630
他会没事的
He'll be all right.

03:55.630 --> 03:58.470
你怎么知道
How do you know?

03:58.470 --> 04:00.530
我不知道
I don't.

04:00.530 --> 04:03.870
我只想让我们都集中精神
I'm just trying to keep us focused.

04:05.870 --> 04:06.870
他病了
He's sick,

04:06.870 --> 04:08.670
但是我确定
but I guarantee you one thing

04:08.670 --> 04:10.670
他要是进监狱的话
that'll make him worse--

04:10.670 --> 04:13.230
会更糟糕
going back to jail.

04:15.230 --> 04:17.730
如果我们进不去
If we don't get in there.

04:17.730 --> 04:20.300
我们也得进监狱
that's where we're all going.

《越狱》第四季 第十一集
Prison.Break.S04E11

05:14.570 --> 05:18.230
他会没事的
He's going to be okay.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.500
我也很害怕
I'm scared, too,

05:19.500 --> 05:21.870
但他现在应该去医院
but a hospital's the best place for him right now.

05:21.870 --> 05:25.230
如果没有想出计划  他是不会去的
He won't go without a plan to complete the job.

05:25.230 --> 05:29.670
阿历克斯和费尔南多应该很快
Well, Alex and Fernando should be back soon

05:29.670 --> 05:31.370
能带录像回来吧
with the video, right?

05:31.370 --> 05:32.730
应该是
Should be, yeah.

05:32.730 --> 05:36.230
那么  我们只需要第六张卡了
So, then, all we need is the sixth card.

05:36.230 --> 05:37.530
格雷琴正在办
Gretchen's working on that.

05:37.530 --> 05:39.930
你觉得我们能相信她吗
You really think we can trust her?

05:39.930 --> 05:42.130
拿那张卡
To get the card?

05:42.130 --> 05:43.600
只能这样
Absolutely.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.630
还有呢
Anything else?

05:44.630 --> 05:47.230
没了
Nope.

05:52.630 --> 05:55.670
八个保安会护送"锡拉"从地下室
Eight guards will accompany Scylla from the basement bunker

05:55.670 --> 05:58.170
移到车库  一辆装甲车会在车库待命
up to the garage, where an armored truck will be waiting.

05:58.170 --> 06:00.770
一辆车不够保险
One truck is not going to be enough security.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.630
所以我调了一队特工开道
That is why I have a full Secret Service escort

06:02.630 --> 06:04.630
去马奇空军基地
to March Air Force Base.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.630
然后把它装载入一架C-130运输机
There, it will be brought aboard a C-130.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.930
全程需空中支援  直至抵达里弗洛克

06:08.930 --> 06:11.570
里夫上校会借三架F-18给我们
Colonel Rififi is lending us three of his F-18s.

06:11.570 --> 06:12.830
你可能觉得难以置信
It may be hard for you to believe,

06:12.830 --> 06:14.730
但我这次确实安排妥当了
but I do have this under control.

06:14.730 --> 06:16.600
你不用担心任何事情
There's nothing for you to worry about.

06:19.430 --> 06:22.770
飞机着陆后  也会采取相同的警戒措施
When the plane lands, the same precautions will be taken.

06:22.770 --> 06:23.770
装甲车
Armored truck

06:23.770 --> 06:26.650
护送到最终地点

06:26.650 --> 06:30.100
下午1点  老房间
Our old room.1pm.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.370
很好
That's fine.

06:34.030 --> 06:36.100
你要去哪
Are you going somewhere?

06:36.100 --> 06:38.970
-我有个约会  -今天吗
I have an appointment. Today?

06:38.970 --> 06:41.530
你告诉我不用担心任何事情
You told me there was nothing to worry about.

06:42.370 --> 06:44.830
别告诉我是去见格雷琴
Just tell me it's not Gretchen.

06:45.970 --> 06:46.970
太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

06:46.970 --> 06:48.070
这是我的私事
It's a personal matter.

06:48.070 --> 06:49.770
我不想做讨论
I'm not going to discuss it.

06:49.770 --> 06:50.830
我不相信她
I don't trust her.

06:50.830 --> 06:52.400
也不是一天两天了
That's nothing new.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.870
我一小时后回来
I'll be back in an hour.

07:02.230 --> 07:04.230
有什么进展
What'd you find out?

07:04.230 --> 07:05.470
你会一直保持清醒状态
You'll be awake the whole time.

07:05.470 --> 07:09.500
届时  你只要做四次局部麻醉
The only anesthetic you're going to need is four minor injections of local--

07:09.500 --> 07:12.470
两次在额头  两次在后脑
two in your forehead and two in the back of your head.

07:12.470 --> 07:13.730
用于做支撑架
And that's for the brace?

07:13.730 --> 07:15.330
对  支撑架
The frame, yeah, and...

07:15.330 --> 07:18.030
安装过程是最不舒服的
attaching that is going to be the most uncomfortable part.

07:18.030 --> 07:21.970
他们会在你颅骨上打四个固定用的钢钉
They're going to have to secure four pins into your skull

07:21.970 --> 07:24.000
会用一个小钻子进行
and they're going to need a small drill to do it.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.900
我们一定要听吗
Do we have to listen to this?

07:25.900 --> 07:27.170
我想听  林肯
I want to hear this, Linc.

07:27.170 --> 07:29.100
然后呢
And then what?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.100
再做一次CT扫描
Uh, another CT scan.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.270
医生会用
The doctor will use

07:32.270 --> 07:33.570
三维成像来确定
the three-dimensional imagery to pinpoint

07:33.570 --> 07:35.370
肿瘤的准确位置
the exact location of the growth.

07:35.370 --> 07:36.670
确定以后呢
And once you have that?

07:36.670 --> 07:38.330
接着就是伽玛刀治疗了
Then it's the Gamma Knife unit.

07:38.330 --> 07:40.170
他们会给你带个头盔
They'll fit you with a helmet,

07:40.170 --> 07:43.000
他们会确定201个洞
they'll calibrate it so that each of the 201 holes

07:43.000 --> 07:46.230
都准确对准肿瘤位置  这时
are aimed directly for the tumor, and at that point...

07:46.230 --> 07:47.870
车里还有两个箱子
I've got two more boxes in the car

07:47.870 --> 07:51.400
你们得帮手拿进来
that you guys got to bring in yourself.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.730
行了
All right.

07:54.730 --> 07:56.030
你没事吧
You okay?

07:56.030 --> 07:58.100
-因为上次见你时  -我很好
Because the last time I saw you... Yeah, I'm fine.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.930
我只是有点脱水
I was just a little dehydrated.

07:59.930 --> 08:01.500
好极了
All right, good.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.570
这是你要的东西
This is the stuff you requested.

08:02.570 --> 08:04.600
你确定能用这些东西进去
You sure this is gonna get you in?

08:04.600 --> 08:06.200
我们会考虑怎么进去
Let us worry about getting in.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.630
你还是考虑我们怎么出来吧
You worry about how we're getting out.

08:07.630 --> 08:10.300
我已派人盯着格雷琴和巴格维尔
I got someone keeping an eye on Gretchen and Bagwell.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.470
如果他们耍花招  他们就玩完了
If they try anything, they're getting taken out.

08:12.470 --> 08:15.800
不会有东西阻碍我们得到"锡拉"
Nothing is going to get between us and Scylla.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.370
你确定你没事
You sure you're all right?

08:19.970 --> 08:21.770
没事  只不过
Yeah, it's just, uh,

08:21.770 --> 08:23.970
我们马上要潜入公司总部
you know, we're breaking into Company headquarters,

08:23.970 --> 08:27.430
多少会有点紧张
and, uh, you'll understand why we're all a little on edge.

08:27.430 --> 08:28.870
明白
Understood.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.070
我以前觉得
You know, I was thinking,

08:30.070 --> 08:31.800
你爸找我办这事时
when your father approached me about doing this,

08:31.800 --> 08:33.230
我感觉
I felt like I was, uh,

08:33.230 --> 08:35.100
就像是在抓鬼一样
chasing a ghost or something, but...

08:35.100 --> 08:37.000
但你们做的一切
'cause of the work you guys have done,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.610
就是今天
today is the day,

08:38.610 --> 08:41.870
我们要彻底打垮这帮混蛋
We're gonna take these bastards down.

08:54.840 --> 08:57.310
到手了吗
You get it?

08:57.310 --> 08:59.780
是的
Got it.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.310
我们还剩4小时
We got four hours.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.610
怎么说
How come?

09:04.610 --> 09:06.410
我要去去医院治疗
I'm going in for treatment.

09:11.940 --> 09:13.910
可以了
Here we go.

09:13.910 --> 09:16.180
"锡拉"
Scylla.

09:16.180 --> 09:20.480
显然  我们有很多事情要解决
Obviously, we've got a lot to figure out.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.210
我们要穿过两面墙
We have to break through two walls.

09:22.210 --> 09:24.610
一面水泥墙  一面玻璃墙
one concrete, one glass

09:24.610 --> 09:27.210
还要保证不发出声音
and do it without making a sound.

09:27.210 --> 09:29.640
高敏感抛物面扩音器
Hypersensitive parabolic microphones,

09:29.640 --> 09:31.210
全方位扫射
pointed in all directions.

09:31.210 --> 09:32.240
地面传感器能检测
The floor sensors can detect

09:32.240 --> 09:34.710
附着地面两磅以上的物体
an added surface load of just two pounds.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.980
所以
So...

09:36.980 --> 09:40.240
我们要在不触碰地面的情况下
we have to traverse the distance between the two walls

09:40.240 --> 09:41.640
跨过两面墙间的距离
without touching the floor

09:41.640 --> 09:44.280
并且无论如何不能产生任何
and do all that without generating any kind

09:44.280 --> 09:46.640
来自身体的热量
of body heat whatsoever.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.980
因为这些是最先进的热感应器
Cause these are the latest in heat-sensing technology.

09:50.980 --> 09:54.010
我们走错一步
We make one wrong move,

09:54.010 --> 09:56.810
监视器就会启动  克兰兹将军就会发现我们
the camera goes on, and General Krantz will know we're inside.

09:56.810 --> 09:58.240
不可思议
It's amazing.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.410
所有这些安保  只有
All this security and only one man

09:59.410 --> 10:00.840
他一个人能使用监视器
has access to video surveillance.

10:00.840 --> 10:04.240
"公司"不想留下任何下面的记录
The Company doesn't want any record of what's going on down there.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.780
我们能进入那个电梯吗
Can we access that elevator?

10:05.780 --> 10:07.010
不能  电梯在"公司"大楼中间
No, it's right in the middle

10:07.010 --> 10:08.440
那里有10层安保
of the Company building-- there are ten layers

10:08.440 --> 10:11.610
我们要去他们看不到的地方
of security. We have to go where they're not expecting us,

10:11.610 --> 10:12.680
先从水泥墙开始
starting with the concrete wall.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.080
苏克雷  你在那里钻孔  对吧
Sucre, you were drilling there, right?

10:15.080 --> 10:16.940
如你所说  墙体用钢纤维强化过
It's fortified with steel fibers, just like you said.

10:16.940 --> 10:18.180
要穿过那面墙
All right, in order to get

10:18.180 --> 10:20.510
需要生成一个
through that, we have to generate

10:20.510 --> 10:24.410
电磁场
an electromagnetic field...

10:26.780 --> 10:30.640
需要生成一个电磁场
We have to generate an electromagnetic field...

10:31.940 --> 10:34.040
要生成
To have, uh,

10:34.040 --> 10:35.780
符合我们需要强度的
an electromagnetic field

10:35.780 --> 10:37.640
电磁场  我们至少
with the force that we want, we're going to need

10:37.640 --> 10:38.980
需要两个车用电池
at least a couple of car batteries.

10:38.980 --> 10:40.140
你能搞得到吗
Can you get that?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.880
可以
Yeah, yeah.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.880
我们可以办到
We can do this.

10:48.510 --> 10:50.940
预计格雷琴什么时候
Uh, what time are we expecting Gretchen

10:50.940 --> 10:53.880
能搞到第六张卡
to get that sixth card?

11:03.340 --> 11:05.740
怎么这么久才来
What took you so long?

11:06.680 --> 11:09.380
你知道我如饥似渴时会怎样
You know how I get when I'm hungry.

11:09.380 --> 11:12.240
我要离开办公室也不容易
It wasn't easy getting away from the office.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.910
我应该像以前那样
I could have come to you...

11:14.910 --> 11:17.310
自己过去
like old times.

11:18.310 --> 11:21.710
我真希望这里能有张红木桌子
I almost wish there was a mahogany desk in here.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.810
你有点紧张
Oh... you're tense.

11:28.740 --> 11:30.040
把外套脱了吧
Take off this jacket.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.510
我帮你拿进去
Let me get in there.

11:39.510 --> 11:42.040
我没有带过来
I didn't bring it with me.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.440
我的卡
My card.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.110
你在找这个  对吧
That is what you're looking for, right?

11:46.110 --> 11:47.980
你在说什么呢  你的卡
What are you talking about? Your card.

11:47.980 --> 11:49.280
你忘啦
You forget.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.040
是我教你如何说谎的
I'm the one that taught you how to lie.

11:52.040 --> 11:56.510
我没想到  在63岁的高龄
I never thought that, at the age of 63,

11:56.510 --> 11:59.440
我仍然会心碎
I could still have my heart broken.

12:00.540 --> 12:02.580
什么让你觉的有必要偷我的卡
Why did you feel you needed to steal my card?

12:02.580 --> 12:05.510
你难道没想过稍加等待
Don't you know that if you'd waited just a little bit longer,

12:05.510 --> 12:07.240
你也可以拥有自己的卡
you'd have had one of your own?

12:07.240 --> 12:08.940
对不起
I'm sorry. I'm...

12:09.780 --> 12:10.980
你要把卡卖给谁
Who are you selling it to?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.140
不是的  不是
That's-That's not why...

12:12.140 --> 12:13.880
谁
Who?

12:13.880 --> 12:17.380
我是你孩子的母亲
I'm the mother of your child.

12:17.380 --> 12:20.540
求你  看在艾米丽的份上
Please, for Emily's sake.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.110
求你了  乔纳森
Please, Jonathan.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.910
求求你
Please.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.140
我爱你
I love you.

12:34.810 --> 12:38.810
再让我看到你
If I ever see you again...

12:38.810 --> 12:41.610
我就杀了你
I'll shoot you on sight.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.840
有事吗  科尔
Is everything all right, Cole?

12:58.840 --> 13:01.910
我有要事跟你说
I got something important you need to know.

13:03.510 --> 13:05.240
我们要发财了
We're gonna be rich.

13:06.710 --> 13:08.910
有个问题
So, here's the question.

13:08.910 --> 13:11.180
我得花多少钱
How much is it gonna cost me

13:11.180 --> 13:13.040
才能让你把外套脱了
to get that jacket off of you?

13:13.040 --> 13:14.480
你说什么
Excuse me?

13:14.480 --> 13:15.850
每次见到你
Last day I'm ever gonna see you.

13:15.850 --> 13:17.500
你都裹得很严
You're all covered up.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.980
我可受不了  1百美金如何
I cannot abide. $100.

13:20.980 --> 13:23.310
你想付钱让我脱衣服
You want to pay me to take my clothes off?

13:23.310 --> 13:25.180
不是脱光  只是脱外套
Not all of them. Just the jacket. Mm.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.840
-2百  -我不会为你脱衣服的
$200. I'm not gonna strip for you.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.040
可怜可怜老人家吧
Pity on an old man.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.480
你真恶心
You're disgusting.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.010
也很淫荡很邪恶
And lecherous and vile.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.240
而且马上就会很有钱
And soon to be wealthy beyond belief.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.040
1千美金
One thousand dollars.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.010
怎么突然这么纯洁
Why so modest all of a sudden?

13:40.010 --> 13:42.940
科尔  马上来我办公室
Cole, I need to see you in my office now.

13:47.240 --> 13:50.680
感谢您致电伽特  有什么需要吗
Thank you for calling Gate. How can I help you?

13:52.040 --> 13:55.780
怀特先生的顶级销售员来办公室了
It was Mr. White in his office with the lead stapler.

13:55.780 --> 13:59.110
科尔  昨天与爱达荷的交易
Cole, yesterday, with that Idaho group,

13:59.110 --> 14:02.580
你为公司赚了3.5万美元
you made this company $35,000.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.640
我得有所表示
And I would like to return the favor.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.410
这是我们的年度旅游
It's our annual cruise.

14:11.410 --> 14:14.540
七天6夜直达环游
Seven days and six nights of non-stop pitching.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.510
我个人通常报销5万
I personally clear $50,000 on most trips,

14:17.510 --> 14:21.280
但凭你的功劳
but for everything you've done,

14:21.280 --> 14:22.880
这是你应得的
it's all yours.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.340
我的薄礼
The least I could do.

14:24.340 --> 14:27.010
今天就出发吗
It leaves today?

14:27.010 --> 14:28.380
回家去收拾一下
Go home and pack.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.240
一周后见
I'll see you in a week.

14:32.810 --> 14:35.180
不好意思  我有些事务
Unfortunately, I have some business

14:35.180 --> 14:37.610
要在这边处理
I need to take care of right here.

14:47.010 --> 14:49.080
它的工作原理是这样的
Okay, so, here's how it works.

14:49.080 --> 14:52.510
一旦传感器检测到任何
As soon as the sensors pick up any kind of a heat source

14:52.510 --> 14:54.780
90度或更高的热源  系统进入待命状态
90 degrees or more, system goes into standby,

14:54.780 --> 14:56.080
黄灯亮起
a yellow light comes on.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.440
待命五秒后
After five seconds in standby,

14:57.440 --> 14:59.980
如果热源没有消失  警报拉响
if the heat source isn't gone, we have an alarm.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.680
我们只有6秒时间穿过过道
So we got six seconds to make it across the hallway

15:02.680 --> 15:03.910
和玻璃墙
and through the glass wall?

15:03.910 --> 15:05.480
差不多
Basically.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.840
如果带上液态氮
If we get our hands on some liquid nitrogen,

15:07.840 --> 15:09.380
我们可以降低温度
we could regulate the temperature.

15:09.380 --> 15:10.740
没错
Yeah.

15:10.740 --> 15:12.810
一石二鸟
Kill two birds with one stone.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.180
看能否搞到这些东西
See if you can get some of that.

15:34.980 --> 15:37.440
我不会问你感觉如何
I'm not going to ask how you're feeling.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.580
很好
Good.

15:39.580 --> 15:42.710
我进"公司"四年后
About four years after I joined the bureau,

15:42.710 --> 15:45.440
我手下第一个特工
my first special agent in charge.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.980
被诊断患有肝癌
he was diagnosed with liver cancer.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.810
但对他来说
But for him,

15:49.810 --> 15:51.380
最难的不是治疗过程
the hardest part wasn't the treatment.

15:51.380 --> 15:53.210
而是要放下工作
The hardest part was leaving the office,

15:53.210 --> 15:55.810
当时我们正在办一起重大敲诈案
because we had this... we had this big RICO case

15:55.810 --> 15:57.810
就要审判了
that was about to go to trial,

15:57.810 --> 16:00.410
我们录了无数小时
and we're talking thousands

16:00.410 --> 16:02.780
的口供  查了五年
of man hours, five years of research.

16:02.780 --> 16:05.480
但他快要做化疗了
And the guy was going to be in chemo.

16:06.210 --> 16:09.010
他很害怕
And he was scared.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.240
他怕我们会输掉案子
He was scared that we were gonna lose the case,

16:11.240 --> 16:13.840
不法之徒则会逃脱法律的制裁
and that a lot of bad men were gonna walk.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.410
我猜  他让一群社会败类
Let me guess: He had a ragtag band of criminals

16:16.410 --> 16:18.580
准备接受惩罚
ready to pick up the slack.

16:21.240 --> 16:24.080
差不多
It was something like that.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.640
我们不会让你失望的  迈克尔
We're not going to let you down, Michael.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.840
你的上司呢
What happened to your boss?

16:38.910 --> 16:41.310
他见证了我们的胜利
Oh, he was there to see us win.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.380
你确定她是特工
You're sure she's a Fed?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.850
我出1千美金  她都不脱上衣
Wouldn't take off her jacket for a thousand dollars.

16:55.850 --> 16:57.410
她肯定收着一把枪
She's got a gun under there.

16:57.410 --> 16:58.650
这就复杂了
It's a complication.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.750
你这么说就对了
Well, that's a nice way to put it.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.650
就像你没拿到第六张卡
Sort of like you not getting the sixth card.

17:02.650 --> 17:04.350
怎么说来着  拖后腿嘛
What are we calling that now, a setback?

17:04.350 --> 17:05.910
放松点
Relax.

17:05.910 --> 17:08.250
你知道我放弃了什么吗
You have any idea what I'm giving up here?

17:08.250 --> 17:09.880
我原本能拿到5万
I was guaranteed 50 grand.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.880
就为5万哭丧着脸  你不是吧
You're crying over $50,000? Are you serious?

17:12.880 --> 17:14.380
我有一份工作
I have a job.

17:14.380 --> 17:16.050
我能赚钱  别人发邮件给我
I make money. I get mail.

17:16.050 --> 17:17.480
都尊呼我  先生
People call me sir.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.780
每天干12小时  吃着残羹剩饭
12-hour days and eating leftover lo-mein.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.480
直觉告诉我  帝博格·巴格维尔
Something tells me Theodore Bagwell

17:21.480 --> 17:23.110
不会坚持太长时间
wouldn't last long in this situation.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.110
可能
Yeah, maybe,

17:25.110 --> 17:27.250
但是科尔·普发会坚持
but Cole Pfeiffer would.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.910
要生气  也要等明天
You want to pout, you do it tomorrow.

17:29.910 --> 17:32.280
我们有事要办
We have work to do.

17:34.810 --> 17:36.810
真的值1.25亿美金吗
Is it really worth $125 million?

17:36.810 --> 17:38.310
价值是两倍
It's worth twice as much.

17:38.310 --> 17:40.410
如果他们不交货呢
What if they refuse to hand it over?

17:40.410 --> 17:43.150
我们要么付钱  要么杀了他们
Either we pay for Scylla, or we kill for it.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.370
苏珊
Susan?

17:56.370 --> 17:59.610
冯  我们得谈谈
Feng, we need to talk.

18:06.810 --> 18:10.150
给我点时间  就一会
Hey, give me a second here, guys, just a second.

18:10.150 --> 18:13.150
我们不能发出超过两分贝的噪音
We can't make any noise above ten decibels.

18:13.150 --> 18:15.280
你搞了两个这家伙吗
You got two of those?

18:15.280 --> 18:17.150
是的
Absolutely.

18:18.050 --> 18:19.510
能成功的  对吧
This is gonna work, right?

18:19.510 --> 18:21.180
应该会
It should.

18:21.180 --> 18:23.210
不仅如此
No, not just that.

18:23.210 --> 18:24.850
整个计划
The whole thing.

18:24.850 --> 18:26.950
我们有成功的机会吗
I mean, do we even have a chance?

18:26.950 --> 18:31.010
只要确定打洞的位置准确
Just make sure the hole is in the right place.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.650
进展如何
So, where are we?

18:39.650 --> 18:42.650
格雷琴没有拿到第六张卡
Gretchen didn't get us the sixth card.

18:43.350 --> 18:45.110
我们需要那张卡  唐
We need that sixth card, Don.

18:45.110 --> 18:46.780
我知道
I know.

18:46.780 --> 18:47.560
如果没有那张卡
If we don't get the sixth card,

18:47.560 --> 18:49.280
我们永远无法破解"锡拉"
We're never gonna crack Scylla.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.350
我知道
I know it.

18:50.350 --> 18:53.520
我们还知道什么
What else do we know?

18:54.550 --> 18:56.110
我们知道他们今天就转移"锡拉"
Well, we know they're moving Scylla today.

18:56.110 --> 18:58.350
我们也不能明目张胆地进将军的办公室
We know we can't just waltz into the General's office

18:58.350 --> 18:59.510
偷最后一张卡
and steal that last card,

18:59.510 --> 19:00.750
我们该怎么应对
so where does that leave us?

19:00.750 --> 19:02.180
应该有办法
Then there's got to be a way.

19:02.180 --> 19:03.650
-肯定有办法  -除非再牺牲一个人
There has to be a way. Not without losing another man.

19:03.650 --> 19:05.840
相信我  我用一周时间思考
Believe me, I spent the last week trying to figure out

19:05.840 --> 19:06.920
如何得到第六张卡
how to get that sixth card,

19:06.920 --> 19:08.760
但每种方法的结果都是某人头上顶枪
And every scenario ends with a gun to someone's head,

19:08.760 --> 19:12.050
而这是不可接受的
And that is not acceptable.

19:14.710 --> 19:17.480
格雷琴给了一点
You know, Gretchen did pass on this one piece

19:17.480 --> 19:19.110
信息给你
of information for you.

19:19.110 --> 19:21.480
应该对你有帮助
This could be helpful.

19:28.420 --> 19:30.050
喂
Hello.

19:33.550 --> 19:35.310
买家出现了
The buyer just showed up.

19:35.310 --> 19:38.080
好的  查清他们要干什么
All right, well, find out what they're up to.

19:39.050 --> 19:42.350
冯先生  很高兴你能来见我们
Mr. Feng, so glad you could come and see us.

19:42.350 --> 19:43.910
我预料我们三个
I was expecting the next time

19:43.910 --> 19:46.780
会再聚在这个房间里
the three of us would be in the same room together,

19:46.780 --> 19:48.680
你们会拿东西给我
that you'd have something for me.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.310
我们预想也是如此
That was our expectation, as well,

19:51.310 --> 19:53.980
但我们遇到点麻烦
but we've hit a few bumps in the road.

19:53.980 --> 19:56.300
为了确保安全
Now, to ensure the item's safe recovery,

19:56.300 --> 19:59.650
我们需要你帮忙
we need your help.

20:19.150 --> 20:21.750
该走了
It's time to go.

20:25.580 --> 20:28.610
逃跑是最好的办法
"All that avails is flight."

20:28.610 --> 20:31.080
或许我爸爸查到了某些事情
Maybe my father was onto something.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.080
如果因为我们试图搞垮公司
If they all die

20:33.080 --> 20:35.250
他们都死了
because we tried to take down the Company,

20:35.250 --> 20:37.350
而我还活着
and I survive because...

20:37.350 --> 20:39.810
只是因为我因病离队
because I called in sick...

20:40.680 --> 20:43.080
我自己该如何活下去
...how am I gonna live with myself?

20:52.280 --> 20:54.210
你会好起来的
You're gonna get through this.

20:54.210 --> 20:56.110
我不去医院了
I'm not going to the hospital.

20:56.980 --> 20:58.980
什么
What?

21:00.250 --> 21:02.280
林肯  只管上车吧
Linc, just get in the car.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.650
我和你们一起去
I'm going with you.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.280
如果我还有行医执照的话
If I still had a medical license,

21:30.280 --> 21:32.310
我肯会因此吊销
I'd lose it over this.

21:32.310 --> 21:35.780
这通常是给癫痫病人用的
This is usually given to epileptics.

21:35.780 --> 21:38.110
它能在接下来的3小时内
It will suppress the rapid firing of neurons

21:38.110 --> 21:39.910
抑制神经元快速发放
for the next three hours,

21:39.910 --> 21:41.410
使病情发作的
making it unlikely

21:41.410 --> 21:43.580
可能性变小
that you'll have a seizure in that time,

21:43.580 --> 21:46.480
不过迈克尔  任何精神上或身体上的压力
but Michael, any added mental or physical stress...

21:46.480 --> 21:47.550
我明白
I get it.

21:47.550 --> 21:48.880
我说真的
I mean it.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.650
不在万不得已的情况下  我希望你别乱动
I don't want you to move unless you absolutely have to.

21:51.650 --> 21:55.380
等一切结束后  我就带你去医院
And as soon as this is over, I'm taking you to the hospital.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.450
你还好吗
You all right?

22:12.180 --> 22:14.810
一切都会按计划进行
This is gonna go exactly as planned.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.910
我保证
I promise.

22:16.910 --> 22:20.050
我不是在为自己祈祷
I'm not praying for me.

22:22.850 --> 22:25.510
我们走吧
Let's go.

22:26.180 --> 22:28.250
你要见我
You wanted to see me?

22:28.250 --> 22:30.380
每月的第二个周二
It's the second Tuesday of the month.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.710
你不是要参加飞鹰天使的聚餐吗
Don't you have your Eagles and Angels luncheon?

22:32.710 --> 22:35.050
我今天不去了
I figured I'd skip it today.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.750
你叫我来就为了确认我的午餐计划吗
You called me in here to confirm my lunch plans?

22:40.510 --> 22:41.850
你是对的
You were right.

22:41.850 --> 22:45.750
如果不是你的提醒  这东西就被偷了
If it weren't for you, this would be in the wind.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.410
-她死了吗  -这样说吧
Is she dead? Let's just say

22:50.410 --> 22:53.080
她不会再干扰我们任何人了
she won't bother either of us anymore.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.110
但我还是想马上转移"锡拉"
But I do want Scylla moved right now.

22:56.110 --> 22:59.580
机械师正在停机坪上检查C-130运输机
Our mechanics are on the tarmac inspecting the C-130.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.910
确定无误后  我们就能转移了
When they sign off, we'll be ready to move.

23:01.910 --> 23:04.210
告诉其他持卡者  在这集合
Call the other card holders, get them in here.

23:10.910 --> 23:14.950
赛尔夫给你们打电话了吗
Did, uh, Self call you, uh, regarding

23:14.950 --> 23:17.510
说了将军那边的小动荡吗
a little snafu with the General?

23:18.150 --> 23:19.610
滚开
Get out of my way.

23:19.610 --> 23:21.280
只是澄清一下
Just for, uh, clarification's sake,

23:21.280 --> 23:25.710
第六张卡是待办的一部分  对吧  先生们
the sixth card is part of the to-do list, right, gentlemen?

23:48.750 --> 23:51.110
游戏开始了
The game's afoot.

23:51.110 --> 23:53.650
迈克尔有办法弄到卡吗
Does Michael have a way to get the card?

23:55.510 --> 23:57.110
我和迈克尔·斯科菲尔德交手过
I've worked with Michael Scofield before,

23:57.110 --> 23:58.310
不论是同伙还是敌人
both with him and against him.

23:58.310 --> 23:59.610
如果没有完整的计划
There's no way he's going down there

23:59.610 --> 24:00.910
他是不会动手的
without a plan to finish the job.

24:00.910 --> 24:02.280
我接到一位老友的电话
I got a call from an old friend.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.450
听说"锡拉"有眉目
Heard Scylla was in play.

24:03.450 --> 24:06.180
他想知道他能否弄到手
He wants to know if he can get in on it.

24:08.950 --> 24:10.850
竞购战
A bidding war?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.450
他出价2百
He's prepared to offer 200.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.610
他说真的吗
Is he for real?

24:13.610 --> 24:15.980
我不清楚  我找了间安全的屋子
I don't know. I've set up a safe house

24:15.980 --> 24:18.010
在那可以跟他谈  你有笔吗
where we can hear him out. Do you have a pen?

24:18.010 --> 24:20.310
等一下
Just a minute.

24:23.110 --> 24:24.650
皮尔蒙特街1917号
1917 Piermont.

24:26.810 --> 24:28.250

24:32.880 --> 24:34.710
感谢您致电伽特公司
Thank you for calling Gate.

24:35.580 --> 24:37.150
我要去跟购买商
I got some last minute negotiations

24:37.150 --> 24:38.980
做最后的协商
with the buyer to speak about.

24:38.980 --> 24:40.310
我马上回来
I'll be back lickety-split.

24:40.310 --> 24:41.580

25:21.610 --> 25:23.610
现在  还有人
Now, does anyone have any questions

25:23.610 --> 25:25.750
对自己要做的部分有疑问吗
about what they're supposed to do?

25:29.650 --> 25:32.010
今早你们在墙上钻的洞
That hole you drilled in the wall this morning.

25:32.010 --> 25:36.210
我们到了那里  如果噪音过大
once we get over there, if we make too much noise,

25:36.210 --> 25:38.180
声波会穿过墙
the sound waves will travel through the wall

25:38.180 --> 25:40.910
被另一侧的传感器检测到
and get picked up by the sensors on the other side.

25:40.910 --> 25:44.910
所以从现在开始  我们要绝对安静
So, from this point on, we need absolute silence.

25:48.350 --> 25:51.280
阿历克斯  祝好运

准备好了吗
You're ready?

26:16.140 --> 26:18.450
走吧
All right.

26:58.650 --> 27:01.110
我们要穿过两面墙
We have to break  through two walls--

27:01.110 --> 27:03.480
一面水泥墙  一面玻璃墙
one concrete, one glass--

27:03.480 --> 27:06.110
还要保证不发出声音
and do it without making a sound.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.150
要穿过那面墙
In order to get through that,

27:17.150 --> 27:20.610
需要生成一个电磁场
we have to generate an electromagnetic field.

27:27.410 --> 27:29.410
要生成
To have

27:29.410 --> 27:31.380
符合我们需要强度的电磁场

27:31.380 --> 27:32.680
我们需要
that we want, we're gonna need

27:32.680 --> 27:34.550
至少两个车用电池
at least a couple of car batteries.

27:45.050 --> 27:46.650
先从水泥墙开始
...starting  with the concrete wall.

27:46.650 --> 27:48.310
苏克雷  你在那里钻孔  对吧
Sucre, you were drilling there,  right?

27:48.310 --> 27:51.410
如你所说  墙体用钢纤维强化过
It's fortified with steel fibers, just like you said.

34:53.610 --> 34:55.610
你确定是这里吗
You sure this is it?

1917 Piermont Avenue.

34:57.110 --> 34:59.470
好的
Okay.

34:59.470 --> 35:01.570
你上次查房是什么时候
When was the last time you swept a room?

35:01.570 --> 35:04.270
在警官学院
The academy.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.270
好的  按我的指示做
All right, just follow my lead, okay?

35:06.270 --> 35:08.910
因为格雷琴和巴格维尔杀人不眨眼
Because Gretchen and Bagwell have no respect for human life.

35:08.910 --> 35:11.310
-如果他们掏家伙  你就开枪  -好的

35:11.310 --> 35:12.870
他们想逃跑的话  开枪

35:15.010 --> 35:16.110
我就开枪

35:16.110 --> 35:17.770
别失手
And don't miss.

35:56.970 --> 35:58.910

35:59.570 --> 36:02.340
我们已恭候多时
We've been waiting.

36:13.940 --> 36:15.570
是冯  他抓住他们了
That's Feng. He's got them.

36:15.570 --> 36:18.170
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯一走出那扇门
When Scofield and Burrows walk through the door,

36:18.170 --> 36:19.740
给他们个投降的机会
give them an opportunity to surrender.

36:19.740 --> 36:21.310
如果能避免正面冲突  最好不过
If we can avoid confrontation, that's the best case scenario.

36:21.310 --> 36:25.540
他们不会乖乖把东西交过来
There's no way they're gonna hand it over without a fight.

36:25.540 --> 36:28.170
如果他们动手  我们以牙还牙
If they take that position, we'll respond in kind.

36:28.170 --> 36:30.310
1.25亿美金
$125 million.

36:30.310 --> 36:34.210
一个樱桃就能烂漫一整天了

36:39.670 --> 36:43.040
把斯科菲尔德留给我

40:24.340 --> 40:26.170
斯库德里在维加斯
Scuderi was in Las Vegas.

40:26.170 --> 40:28.170
你觉得我们能把内华达州
You think we could get the state of Nevada

40:28.170 --> 40:29.470
变成赌城吗
to outlaw gambling?

40:29.470 --> 40:31.970
我有些怀疑
I somehow doubt that.

40:31.970 --> 40:33.970

40:33.970 --> 40:35.140

I would rather stay.

40:38.170 --> 40:39.740
此时此刻
Now more than ever,

40:39.740 --> 40:41.470
我们更需要法律的执行
we need the support of law enforcement.

40:41.470 --> 40:43.210
准备好转移时
I will call you

40:43.210 --> 40:45.140
