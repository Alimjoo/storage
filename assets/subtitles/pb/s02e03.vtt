03:56.720 --> 03:57.700

04:07.830 --> 04:09.590

04:21.030 --> 04:22.420
为什么?

04:22.430 --> 04:30.630
所有可以帮我们销声匿迹 的东西都在那辆车上
Because in that car is everything we need to disappear.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.290
有什么新发现?
What have you got?

05:11.300 --> 05:12.690
是这么回事
Here we go boss,one of the blues

05:12.700 --> 05:14.920
有个兄弟几小时前抓了个流浪汉
hauled in a vagrant a couple hours ago.

05:14.930 --> 05:17.700
这几件东西似乎都不属于他
Seems the man was in possession of an item or two that didn't exactly belong to him.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.540
看来我们已经逮到第一个错误了
Looks like we got our first mistake.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.250

Hey,you got any of that oriental jerky?

06:20.260 --> 06:22.190

伙计 顺便再给我弄瓶老酒

06:45.000 --> 06:46.520

How goes it,Roy?

06:57.400 --> 06:58.920
实话告诉你
To be honest,Roy,I could've done

06:58.930 --> 07:00.550

without the knee to the junk.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.520
你居然咬我 布拉德
You bit me,Brad.

07:02.530 --> 07:04.150

Like a little girl,you bite me.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.620

07:05.630 --> 07:07.370
或许吧
Yeah,probably did.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.350
我们竟然为这种事打架
You know it's crazy,us taking it out

07:10.360 --> 07:11.990
听上去真的很疯狂
on each other for how things turned out.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.750
要怪的话  就该怪那些犯人
You want someone to blame,how about those convicts

07:14.760 --> 07:17.650
每天起来看到的都是他们的报道
staring up at us from the papers every morning.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.520
他们害我丢了工作
They took my job,

07:19.530 --> 07:23.550
我的养老金、尊严都没了
my pension,my dignity.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.790
当他们翻过那堵墙的时候
When they went over that wall,

07:24.800 --> 07:26.620
他们把一切都带走了
they took all of it right along with them.

07:26.630 --> 07:28.860
带走了我奋斗了一辈子的东西
Everything I worked  for my whole life.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.550
看到悬赏了吗?
See that reward they got?

07:32.560 --> 07:35.590
这帮混蛋死了都比我们活着值钱
Those ass-hats are worth more dead than you and I are alive.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.050
不用多久了
Not for long.

07:37.060 --> 07:38.550
什么意思?
What do you mean?

07:38.560 --> 07:41.730
我是说有人会得到这笔悬赏 好比是我
I mean somebody's going to get that money,might as well be me.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.250
像那样的抓捕工作
You know a job like that

07:46.260 --> 07:49.120
如果多个帮手会更容易些
might go a little smoother with an extra pair of hands.

07:49.130 --> 07:51.590
你真认为我会和你分享那笔赏金?
You really think I'm going to split that reward with you?

07:51.600 --> 07:53.490
当你遇到他们的时候
I'm just saying,you run into those brothers,

07:53.500 --> 07:55.720
双拳难敌四手
two of them,one of you.

07:55.730 --> 07:58.260
到时候你就知道有帮手的好处了
You might find yourself wishing for a good wingman.

快去搞定它 麦克
Just get it done,Mike.

08:16.900 --> 08:17.950

08:19.430 --> 08:21.930
是的 恰克
Yeah,I hope so,Chuck.

08:23.290 --> 08:24.620
我想你们可能拖走了我的车
I think you may have towed my car.

08:25.890 --> 08:26.740
什么样的车?
What did it look like?

08:26.750 --> 08:28.180
什么样的车?
What did it look like?

08:28.190 --> 08:30.090
就是你偷背包的车
The car you stole the backpack from.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.270
什么样的车?
What did it look like?

08:32.320 --> 08:35.100
我记不清了 或许是灰色的吧
I don't know,man,maybe it was gray.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.410
灰色的雅阁
It's a gray Accord.

08:37.460 --> 08:38.310
车牌号?
License number?

08:38.320 --> 08:39.860
我就知道这些了
Look,man,that's all I know.

08:39.870 --> 08:41.260
我不是去偷车的
I wasn't after the car.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.210
我还以为包里会有些衣服
Thought the bag had some clothes in it.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.280
还记得车停在哪吗?
You remember where The car was parked?

08:46.290 --> 08:47.110
你停哪的?
Where'd you park it?

08:48.380 --> 08:50.000
汉考克大街和十五大道的拐角
Corner of Hancock and 15th.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.370
我不知道 或许在十五大道附近吧
I don't know,maybe around 15th somewhere,

08:53.220 --> 08:54.490
但是现在肯定不在那了
but it ain't going to be there anymore.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.180
-此话怎讲?  -那就是为什么我没有机会
What do you mean? That's the reason I didn't get

08:57.190 --> 08:58.700
再弄些其他的东西
to grab anything else.

08:59.370 --> 09:00.660
被拖车拖走了
Tow truck rolls up.

09:01.200 --> 09:01.950

It's going to be 60 bucks for the tow,

09:07.900 --> 09:09.110
24块过夜费

09:22.880 --> 09:25.000
好了 我去把你的车开来
All right,be right back with your vehicle.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.230
再等几分钟
Shouldn't take but a few minutes.

09:37.230 --> 09:37.820
喂

As in,Fernando Sucre?

09:41.770 --> 09:43.720
-难道还会有别的?  -但愿没有
Is there another one? Man,I hope not.

09:44.190 --> 09:47.060
但是我的兄弟苏克雷不会给我打电话
But my boy Sucre would not be calling me on the telephone,

09:47.070 --> 09:50.920
他知道这会让我成为他潜逃的从犯
thereby making me an accessory to <i>his dumb-ass escape,man.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.540
我很抱歉 我只是...
I-I'm sorry,bro,I just...

09:52.940 --> 09:55.310
我只是希望你帮我联系玛丽克鲁兹
I just... I just need you to get a hold of Maricruz.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.510
我不能给她打电话
I can't call her cell

09:56.520 --> 09:58.690
因为探员肯定监听的

09:58.700 --> 09:59.360

Homie,listen,man,

09:59.370 --> 10:01.370
忘了那女孩吧

10:03.160 --> 10:04.340
我就会在监狱里
I'd still be at Fox River,

10:04.340 --> 10:06.110
老老实实把刑服完
sitting in cell 40 on your old bunk.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.800
我希望你站稳了
Yeah,well,I hope you're holding on

10:07.820 --> 10:10.580
我有个坏消息
to something tight 'cause I'm about to break it down for you,brother.

她要和赫克托结婚了
She's getting married to Hector

21:00.690 --> 21:03.080
就别想出去了
this may be the only place I'll be able to see you.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.840
你不想知道我的解释吗?
Do you even want to hear my side of things?

21:05.850 --> 21:07.260
不想知道  莎拉
Not particularly,Sara,no.

21:08.440 --> 21:11.930
特别是现在我都不知道你算哪一边的
Especially when I have no idea whose "side" you're on.

21:12.710 --> 21:13.740
但是我知道一件事
But I do know this.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.820
总要有人要为福克斯河的事承担责任
Somebody is going to go down because of what happened at Fox River.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.520
如果不是你的话
And it would be in both of our best interests

21:20.530 --> 21:22.220
对我们两个人都好
if that someone was not you.

21:22.830 --> 21:25.090
为了确保这个  我们必须采取些措施
And to ensure this,certain steps need to be taken.

21:25.100 --> 21:25.850
首先
One:

21:26.590 --> 21:28.470
你要去参加座谈会
you should go to a daily recovery meeting.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.080
其次
Two:

21:29.080 --> 21:30.800
你需要在审理前就去参加
you need to go before a judge

21:30.810 --> 21:32.430
并且宣称无罪  还有...
and plead not guilty,and three,

21:32.430 --> 21:33.190
爸爸  我不...

21:33.190 --> 21:34.560
你必须告诉惩戒署
you need to tell the D.O.C.

21:35.130 --> 21:37.810
你对他们越狱知之甚少
everything you know about how that prison was being run.

21:38.370 --> 21:39.580
还有 珀尔狱长的事
And that Warden Pope,

21:39.590 --> 21:41.270
因为斯科菲尔德帮他作私事
how he was granting favors to Scofield

21:41.280 --> 21:43.720
他就给与斯科菲尔德特权
because Scofield helped him with his personal projects,

21:43.730 --> 21:46.470
让他方便到达管制区域
thereby exposing him to certain restricted areas

21:46.470 --> 21:47.750
从而使他有机会
where he may have been able

21:47.760 --> 21:49.730
拿到医务室的钥匙
to obtain a key to the infirmary.

21:51.930 --> 21:53.020
我不能那么做
I can't do that.

21:53.710 --> 21:54.850
可以 你可以的  莎拉.
Oh,yes you can,Sara.

21:54.860 --> 21:56.320
你可以  你必须这么做
You can do that and you will.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.610
是我干的  爸爸
I did it,Dad.

22:02.010 --> 22:04.630
我没有关门  不是别人
I left the door open,me and no one else.

22:05.670 --> 22:06.600
那不是真的
That's not true.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.370
是真的
Yes,it is.

22:08.380 --> 22:09.700
那不是真的
That's not true.

22:12.420 --> 22:13.200
莎拉...
Sara...

22:15.320 --> 22:16.840
就照我说的去做
just do what you're told,

22:18.270 --> 22:21.230
否则后果会很严重...
otherwise there will be consequences...

22:22.520 --> 22:23.790
我们都会被影响到的
that will affect us all.

22:24.950 --> 22:26.710
你知道我的意思吗?
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

22:28.210 --> 22:28.920
明白
Yes,sir.

22:30.140 --> 22:30.870
很好
Good.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.740
再过一星期... 我会被任命为

22:36.740 --> 22:39.430
新一任的美国副总统
the new Vice President of the United States.

22:39.430 --> 22:41.330
他们会举办一个庆典  会邀请你
There will be a ceremony,you will be invited,

22:42.720 --> 22:43.910
但是你却不能出席
but you will not attend.

22:47.460 --> 22:48.300
再见  莎拉

23:04.840 --> 23:07.250
-我们听点音乐吧  -不行
Let's put some music on. Don't.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.010
我忘了
I forgot.

23:08.390 --> 23:09.090
不能听电台
No radio.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.420
这里太静了
Man,it's quiet out here.

23:12.430 --> 23:15.300
里面一直都很吵
Inside,there was always noise,you know?

23:15.680 --> 23:17.520
总有人喊叫  守卫们四处巡逻
Someone yelling,guards making rounds.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.440
我都已经习惯了
I got used to it.

23:19.650 --> 23:20.310
没错
You're right.

23:21.220 --> 23:22.020
我们回去吧
We should go back.

23:27.120 --> 23:27.970
那些纹身...
The tats...

23:28.550 --> 23:29.940
不只是为了逃出来准备的  是吧?
they weren't just for getting out,were they?

23:31.750 --> 23:33.230
越狱只是个开始
Breaking out was just the beginning.

23:34.050 --> 23:35.490
现在才开始有点乐趣
Now,it gets a little more interesting.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.840
看来我被绑到电椅上
Mm-hmm,'cause me being strapped to the electric chair

23:37.840 --> 23:38.710
还不够有趣吗
wasn't interesting enough.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.530
我是说 在里面会有些意外因素
All I'm saying is inside,we had the element of surprise.

23:42.530 --> 23:43.870
但是没人知道我们的计划
No one knew what we were planning.

23:46.370 --> 23:47.460
我有点担心那个男的
There's something about this guy--

23:48.270 --> 23:49.710
电梯里的那个家伙
the one in the elevator.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.390
他就像是...
It's like...

23:53.990 --> 23:56.060
就像是他知道我们的目的地和想法
it's like he knows where we're  <i>going,what we're thinking.

23:57.070 --> 23:58.600
如果真的这样 一切都是时间问题了
If that's true,  <i>it's just a matter of time

23:58.610 --> 24:00.260
他会发现犹他的钱
before he finds out  <i>about the money in Utah,

24:00.910 --> 24:02.790
纹身的秘密 我们去墨西哥的方法
Bolshoi Booze,  <i>our way into Mexico.

24:05.080 --> 24:05.860
所有的一切
Everything.

24:14.060 --> 24:14.870
你准备好了?
Are you ready for this?

24:16.720 --> 24:17.320
打电话吧
Make the call.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.790
语音信箱: 滴声后请留言
ELECTRONIC VOICE (on phone): Please leave a message after the beep.

24:25.620 --> 24:27.820
是我
Hey,it's me.

24:29.610 --> 24:30.490
我接到林肯了
I've got Linc.

24:31.550 --> 24:32.450
我们在去那儿的路上
We're on our way there.

24:33.610 --> 24:35.140
如果你因为什么原因不能去的话
If for some reason  <i>you can't make it,

24:35.540 --> 24:39.140
打这个电话找我  9-1-7-4-5-4...
call me back at 9-1-7-4-5...

24:39.150 --> 24:40.620
我们刚刚从监听处拿到的
We just got this from surveillance.

24:41.060 --> 24:42.910
你还记得斯科菲尔德在入狱前
You remember that voicemail Scofield prepaid

24:42.920 --> 24:44.410
- 租用的那个语音信箱吗?  - 记得
for when he went off to prison? Yeah.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.550
有人在里面留言了
Someone just left a message on it.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.140
谁?
Who?

24:48.150 --> 24:49.210
斯科菲尔德
Scofield.

24:49.770 --> 24:50.520
好像是...
Something...

24:51.060 --> 24:53.280
好像是关于一次会面  听起来他好像
something about a meeting,  <i>it sounded like he was

24:53.280 --> 24:54.690
在等某个人去听那个消息
waiting for someone else  <i>to check the message

24:54.700 --> 24:55.540
然后打回给他
and then call him back.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.450
这是区号  那是手机号码
This prefix,that's a cell phone number.

24:57.460 --> 24:58.530
只要手机开着...
As long as it's turned on...

24:58.540 --> 25:00.110
我们就能追踪到他的确切位置
We can track exactly where he is.

25:23.570 --> 25:26.560
不要做蠢事  不要做蠢事
Don't do anything stupid. Don't do anything stupid

25:34.650 --> 25:35.570
不
No.

25:57.260 --> 25:58.440
有事吗  警官
Is there a problem,officer?

25:59.240 --> 26:00.600
知道为什么要你靠边停吗  先生
Do you know why I pulled you over today,sir?

26:02.100 --> 26:02.850
超速
Speeding?

26:04.090 --> 26:05.750
请出示你的驾照和车辆行驶证
Let me see your license and registration please?

26:07.160 --> 26:08.440
是这样的  我
The thing is,I,uh...

26:08.440 --> 26:09.860
我-我-我的钱包掉了
I-I-I lost my wallet.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.100
行驶证也可以
Well,I guess your registration will have to do just fine then.

26:24.610 --> 26:25.740
那么
So...

26:26.490 --> 26:29.790

26:32.110 --> 26:33.310
米勒是我的妻子
Mrs. Miller's my wife.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.130

27:08.600 --> 27:09.350
他招了吗?
Did he sing?

27:11.340 --> 27:12.700
就像竹筒倒豆子
Like a fat,sweaty bird.

27:27.910 --> 27:29.000

Hey,sweet pea.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.520

嘿  帮我一个忙
Hey,why don't you do me a favor

27:38.570 --> 27:39.600
拿一只粉笔
and grab a piece of chalk

27:40.090 --> 27:42.510
给爸爸在地上画一幅图
and draw Daddy a picture on the ground,okay?

27:47.410 --> 27:48.460
你还好吗
So,how're you feeling,huh?

27:50.200 --> 27:51.340

Sorta.

28:09.090 --> 28:12.020
但是学校的同学们都在谈论
But the kids at school have been sayin' stuff.

28:12.790 --> 28:13.870
他们说什么了
Okay,what have they been saying?

28:14.900 --> 28:17.760
他们说你上电视了是因为你是个坏人
They're saying you're on TV because you're a bad man.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.050
那你怎么想呢
And what do you think?

28:23.700 --> 28:27.410
我想 如果我在一个不能看到你的地方
I think if I were someplace and they wouldn't let me

28:27.410 --> 28:30.520
我也会逃出去的
leave to see you,I wouldn't do what they said,either.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.840

and if she is willing to trust Daddy...

28:57.260 --> 28:58.920

29:58.080 --> 29:58.620

Where?

30:00.040 --> 30:01.320
有一个巡警报告说
There's a patrolman who thinks he's has

30:01.330 --> 30:03.900
他在宾州的拉特罗布截停了 苏克雷·费尔南多的车了
Fernando Sucre pulled over outside of Latrobe,Pennsylvania.

30:03.900 --> 30:05.620
联系当地警局

告诉他们  我们要活捉这个人
Make it clear that we want this man in custody,

30:07.730 --> 30:09.060

not in a body bag.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.550
死人告诉不了我们他的朋友在哪
Dead men can't tell us where their friends are.

30:11.930 --> 30:12.680
是的 明白了
Yeah,you got it.

30:55.910 --> 30:57.330

32:26.970 --> 32:28.300
- 看到他了么?   - 没
Do you see him? Nope.

32:28.820 --> 32:29.780
也许他没收到你的消息
Maybe he didn't get your message.

32:40.450 --> 32:41.430
他们停下来了
They've stopped.

32:42.500 --> 32:43.970
前面几英里处 那儿...
Couple miles up ahead. There's...

32:44.970 --> 32:46.080
那儿没什么特别的啊 他们...
There's nothing up there. What...?

32:47.160 --> 32:47.980
他们在等什么?
What are they waiting on?

32:49.240 --> 32:49.980
或是等什么人?
Or who?

32:56.530 --> 32:58.480

33:26.270 --> 33:27.070
亮警灯
Go red.

33:27.770 --> 33:28.960
快 警灯!
Now,go red!

33:56.240 --> 33:57.060
还有一件事
Just one more thing.

33:59.590 --> 34:00.320
你相信我么
Do you trust me?

34:03.490 --> 34:04.310
当然
Of course.

34:05.490 --> 34:07.490
有什么办法可以让猎人放弃追踪？
How do you throw the hunter off the scent?

34:08.480 --> 34:09.380
毁掉猎物
Get rid of the prey.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.240
记住 按下电台扫描后
Remember,once I hit scan,

34:13.240 --> 34:15.640
在搜到103.7之前我们约有30秒的时间
we'll have about 30 seconds before it reaches 103.7.

34:15.640 --> 34:16.510
然后就爆炸了？
And then she blows?

34:17.410 --> 34:19.170
是的 准备好了没？
That's right. Ready?

34:19.170 --> 34:19.940
是的
Yeah.

34:39.580 --> 34:40.260
好了 我们闪
All right,let's go.

34:45.620 --> 34:48.610
等等 音乐没有变过
Wait,The music is not changing.

34:49.260 --> 34:50.240
等等 等等
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:51.790 --> 34:52.580
出问题了
Something's wrong.

34:54.070 --> 34:54.770
怎么了
What happened?

34:55.870 --> 34:56.640
我也不知道
I don't know.

34:57.290 --> 34:58.440
一定要让它爆炸
But we're going to need the explosion.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.090
他追来了
He's here.

35:04.890 --> 35:05.620
他追来了
He's here.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.590
这收音机大概卡了
The radio must have jammed.

35:16.460 --> 35:17.900
我们必须手动调
We're going to have to set it off manually.

35:18.520 --> 35:19.810

我能理解他们的原因是...

38:47.320 --> 38:48.290
因为我和他们一样

38:51.910 --> 38:53.880

费尽心思实施越狱计划
Put in all that work,break out of prison,

39:22.940 --> 39:24.850
却没想在这阴沟翻船

They'll turn their attention to the other guys,

40:22.720 --> 40:24.720
