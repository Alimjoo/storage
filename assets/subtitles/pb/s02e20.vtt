03:21.160 --> 03:22.930
说明我们得马上离开了
It means it's time to go.

我们不会再回来 所以 呃...
There's no turning back now, so, uh...

03:36.960 --> 03:38.960
我知道这不是你想要的生活
I know it's not what you wanted from your life,

03:39.000 --> 03:43.530
不过要是你有兴趣的话 这里还有个位置
but in case your interested,there is room for one more.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.000
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield,

03:45.030 --> 03:47.460
你在邀请我一起去远航看日出么?
you asking me to sail off into the sunset with you?

03:47.500 --> 03:50.630
呃 其实是艘货船 不过 呃... 算是吧
Well, it's more of a freighter, but, uh... yes.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.860
我会到的
I'll be there.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.900
一会儿见
I'll see you soon.

04:03.130 --> 04:05.830
她正朝兰德威尔去

04:05.860 --> 04:06.900
好的
All right.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.830
盯着她 我马上到
Stay on her, I'll be right there.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.330
这他妈算什么啊?
What the hell's this?

04:14.360 --> 04:15.500
我尽力了
I tried, boss.

04:15.530 --> 04:17.400
你看到他逃掉的
You saw how he just took off.

04:17.430 --> 04:18.730
我只看到一个逃出来的蠢蛋
The only thing I'm seeing is an escaped con,

04:18.760 --> 04:20.160
摇尾乞怜像只狗一样
who's begging to be taken nort-ay.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.430
好吧
Okay,

04:21.460 --> 04:23.630
好吧 听着 或许我们可以打电话给出租车公司
Okay, look, maybe we could call the cab company

04:23.660 --> 04:25.460
问下帝博格去哪了
and find out where T-bag was dropped off.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.700
这还像句人话
Now, you're talking.

04:26.730 --> 04:28.200
我看到电话了...
I saw some phone...

04:30.800 --> 04:33.500
要怎么样你才肯放过我们?
what's it going to take for you to forget you ever found us?

04:33.530 --> 04:35.900
没钱商量个屁啊
There ain't enough pesos in TJ.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.760
你确定?
You sure about that?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.230
来吧 尽管开枪吧
Go ahead, shoot.

04:40.260 --> 04:41.800
不过这办法好像不太好吧
But it might not be the best idea seeing as

04:41.830 --> 04:44.960
只有我一个人知道你那小甜心被关在哪
how I'm the only one who knows where your chiquita's tied up.

04:45.930 --> 04:47.400
玛丽克鲁兹到底在哪?
Where is Maricruz?

04:47.430 --> 04:49.630
要是我告诉你 那我不是死定了
If I tell you, I'm as good as dead.

04:49.660 --> 04:52.530
当然了 要是你开枪 那她也死定了
Of course if you shoot, so is she.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.260
-你在胡扯        -像是么?
-You're bluffing me. -Am I?

04:57.330 --> 04:58.660
我跟你直说吧
Let me tell you in words

04:58.700 --> 05:01.260
让你更清楚点
you might be more familiar with.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.560
她在一个洞里
She's in "the hole"

05:02.600 --> 05:05.000
有足够的水和食物可以维持三个星期
with enough food and water to last about three weeks

05:05.030 --> 05:06.730
要是再久一点的话
Any longer than that

05:06.760 --> 05:10.160
你的小甜心就成人肉干了
your sweet little plum's gonna dry up like a raisin.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.700
-要是她有事的话 告诉我...           -告诉你?
If anything happens to her,so help me...  -help you?

05:12.730 --> 05:15.860
照我说是该你帮我吧
Way I see it,it's you who's gotta help me.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.700
我得不到钱的话
'Cause you ain't gettin' your hands

05:17.730 --> 05:19.460
你就休想得到你的甜心
on that girl 'til I get my hands on that money.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.000
我想我们可以成为拍档了吧
Guess that makes us partners.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.530
要走了
Here we go.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.260
她还没到
She's not here.

The ship is leaving.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.860

07:20.860 --> 07:22.930

Son of a bitch.

07:31.230 --> 07:33.060
-他在哪?       -我不知道
-Where is he?  -I don't know.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.600
别再耍把戏了 莎拉
No more games, Sara.

07:34.630 --> 07:35.730
你正赶去见他呢
You were on your way to see him.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.930
不 不是的
No, I wasn't.

07:36.960 --> 07:41.100
你刚才这是强制逃脱联邦探员的监护
You were just compelled to flee the custody of a federal agent?

07:50.260 --> 07:51.660
我找不到她
I couldn't find her.

07:53.430 --> 07:55.960
莎拉...
Sara...

07:56.000 --> 07:57.460
我们得回去
we got to go back.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.000
迈克尔 不行的 你什么都做不了
Michael, you can't, there's nothing you can do.

07:59.030 --> 08:00.330
总会有办法的
There's always something you can do.

08:00.360 --> 08:01.500
这次不行
Not this time.

08:01.530 --> 08:03.830
真的不行
Not this time, man.

08:03.860 --> 08:06.430
都已结束了
It's done.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.100

08:14.360 --> 08:16.160

Get her a donut.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.930
给她个油炸圈饼 行么? 给她油炸圈饼
Can we get her a donut? Get her a donut.

Look her up!

09:59.380 --> 10:01.950
你他妈到底去哪了  迈克尔?
Where the hell did you go, Michael?

10:02.980 --> 10:04.810
马宏现在怎么样了?
So,where the hell is Mahone?

10:04.850 --> 10:05.850
我不知道  长官
I don't know, sir.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.580
他已经失踪一个多星期了
He's been MIA for the last week or so.

10:07.610 --> 10:10.380
你认为他知道我们在调查他了吗
You think he knows I've been barking up one of his trees.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.750
下午好  弗兰克林先生
Mr. Franklin, good afternoon.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.480
这位是里查德.萨林斯
This is Richard Sullins.

10:15.510 --> 10:17.280
美国联帮调查局内务部主管
Director of Internal Affairs at the FBI.

10:17.310 --> 10:18.910
我的工作是
Which means

10:18.950 --> 10:20.510
当我们的人犯错时
whenever one of our people does something wrong,

10:20.550 --> 10:23.310
我就有责任把他们纠正过来
it's my job to make it right.

10:23.350 --> 10:25.780
我们到底要谈些什么?
How right are we talking about?

10:25.810 --> 10:26.980
当然  让我说的明白些
Well, let's be clear,

10:27.010 --> 10:28.750
你是个重罪罪犯
you are a convicted felon

10:28.780 --> 10:30.380
一个从州政府监狱逃出来的人
who broke out of a state penitentiary,

10:30.410 --> 10:31.810
我能做的非常有限
there's only so much I can do.

10:31.850 --> 10:33.880
好啊  那我也没什么好说的
Well, there's only so much I can say.

10:33.910 --> 10:35.450
现在  我很抱歉
Now, I'm sorry

10:35.480 --> 10:36.580
我不相信任何人
if I seem a little bit skeptical.

10:36.610 --> 10:38.480
上次有个联邦探员
But the last time a federal agent came up

10:38.510 --> 10:40.780
来跟我做交易
in here offering me a deal,

10:40.810 --> 10:41.980
居然还附上一根绳子...
there was a string attached...

10:42.010 --> 10:43.810
让我上吊自杀
that I was supposed to put around my neck.

10:43.850 --> 10:46.410
我被批准给你...嗯...给你减刑
I've been authorized to, uh,offer you a reduced sentence

10:46.450 --> 10:48.680
作为交换  你得指证马宏
in exchange for your testimony against agent Mahone,

10:48.710 --> 10:51.010
你18年的刑期将被缩短到只有18个月
instead of 18 years,you'll be looking at 18 months.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.580
18个月?
18 months?

10:52.610 --> 10:53.750
嘿  你知道吗
Hey, you know what?

10:53.780 --> 10:54.950
那家伙想要杀死我
That man tried to kill me.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.280
如果被他发现我还活得如此滋润
So as soon as he finds out that I'm singing,

10:57.310 --> 10:58.850
我可能连十八天都活不到
I probably won't even last 18 days.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.050
富兰克林先生...
Mr. Franklin...

11:00.080 --> 11:02.310
他威胁我的家庭
he threatened my family.

11:02.350 --> 11:04.980
我现在要离开这里去保护他们
Now, I need to be out there protecting them.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.650
所以  除非你能给我这些
So until you can offer me something like that...

11:09.850 --> 11:13.750
否则我不会为这该死的事作证的
I'm not testifying to a damn thing.

11:13.780 --> 11:14.910
警卫!
Guard!

11:16.450 --> 11:18.710
我给你自由
Free man.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.010
你和你的家庭
You and your family.

11:21.050 --> 11:24.610
将得到证人保护  一个全新开始
Witness protection, fresh start.

11:24.650 --> 11:26.210
档案记录也清除么?
Clean record?

11:26.250 --> 11:28.150
完全清除
Spick-and-span.

11:31.850 --> 11:34.510
我要书面记录和一个见证人
You put that in writing and you got yourself a witness.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.080
长官?
Sir?

11:48.110 --> 11:50.480
我敲了门  但是...
I knocked, but...

11:51.380 --> 11:53.450
你还好么?
you okay?

11:54.410 --> 11:56.880
你觉得这个看起来象什么?
What does that look like to you?

11:56.910 --> 11:58.150
这儿  就在这儿
There, right there.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.280
恩  一个三角形?
Uh, it's a triangle.

11:59.310 --> 12:01.680
对  我也这么认为
Yeah,I thought so,too.

12:04.910 --> 12:06.580
那这个呢?  在这儿
How about this? Right there.

12:06.610 --> 12:08.880
一个数学符号--∏
It's the mathematical symbol for pi.

12:08.910 --> 12:10.510
3.14
3.14

12:10.550 --> 12:11.550
我想这是个日期  或者地区代码
I'm thinking date, area code.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.280
314  那是密苏里
314, that's Missouri.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.010
那你认为斯科菲尔德在那儿?
So you think Scofield's there?

12:15.050 --> 12:16.210
我怀疑是
I doubt it.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.110
你的希腊字母表呢 兰探员?
How's your greek alphabet, agent Lang?

12:18.150 --> 12:21.680
我不知道  我想大概...
I don't know. I guess it's...

12:23.210 --> 12:25.280
如果我说三角形就是三角洲
what if I told you that triangle was a delta

12:25.310 --> 12:26.450
而这个
and that this,

12:26.480 --> 12:29.510
这里不是数学符号∏而是一个字母呢
this here was not the symbol pi but the letter?

12:29.550 --> 12:32.510
我从没在他的纹身的图片中看到过这些
I didn't see any of those in the photos of the tattoos.

12:32.550 --> 12:33.680
不是纹身里的
They weren't in the tattoos.

12:33.710 --> 12:35.280
我们把这些从硬盘中找出
We pulled these from his original sketches

12:35.310 --> 12:36.880
放到他的初稿里
off the hard drive.

12:38.810 --> 12:41.380
斯科菲尔德将他所有逃跑的步骤都标明了
Scofield numbered all of the steps of his escape.

12:41.410 --> 12:42.780
这就是他怎样将所有的都制订好计划
It's how he kept everything in order,

12:42.810 --> 12:44.350
但看上去却没有使用数字
but it looks like that he didn't use numbers,

12:44.380 --> 12:46.950
因为他用了这些字母  就像  恩...
that he used letters like, um...

12:48.210 --> 12:49.880
纹身的草图
a sketch of this tattoo.

12:49.910 --> 12:51.880
艾伦.施怀特标注了一个
Allan Schweitzer marked with an Alpha,

12:51.910 --> 12:53.550
希腊字母表的第一个字母
first letter of the greek alphabet.

12:53.580 --> 12:54.710
Fiephis 计划
First step of his plan.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.980
腊字母表的第五个字母
Epsilon, fifth letter of the greek alphabet.

12:57.010 --> 12:57.950
计划的第五步
Fifth step in his plan.

12:57.980 --> 12:59.410
这是
Here's theta,

12:59.450 --> 13:00.910
还有
and kappa...

13:00.950 --> 13:01.850
那些呢?
how about that?

13:01.880 --> 13:03.510
边境  对吧?
Tau? At the border, right?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.350
现在接近尾声了  想和我一起去么?
Getting closer to the end now, you with me?

13:05.380 --> 13:06.680
所以你认为...
So you think...

13:06.710 --> 13:08.010
他的
his omega...

13:08.050 --> 13:09.480
希腊字母表的最后一个字母
the last letter of the greek alphabet.

13:09.510 --> 13:11.780
就是他的计划的最后一步
Is the last step of his plan.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.250
那是什么?
What is that?

13:15.280 --> 13:17.150
-花中的基督?  -一朵玫瑰
-Christ in a flower?   -A rose.

13:17.180 --> 13:18.780
还有这些数字-- 617.
And these numbers... 617.

13:18.810 --> 13:20.450
也许是圣经的第6章第17节
Could be biblical; chapter 6, verse 17.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.710
6-1-7  617
6-1-7, 617.

13:22.750 --> 13:23.910
六月十七号
June 17th.

13:23.950 --> 13:26.080
哦  今天几号?
Oh, what's today?

13:26.110 --> 13:27.180
十五号
The 15th.

13:27.210 --> 13:28.380
所以无论他的最后一步是什么...
So whatever his last step is...

13:28.410 --> 13:30.250
都有可能是在这两天
it's going to happen in two days.

13:36.180 --> 13:37.180
不
No.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.080
没有找到斯塔姆先生这名字
There is Mr. Stammel in our system.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.170
你去租车的那地方查查
You should check with the buses and the car rental...

13:43.780 --> 13:45.400
-他说什么?         -没什么  没有发现
What's he saying?  -Nothing. The same as the rest.

13:45.410 --> 13:46.780
也许他没搞明白
Maybe he don't comprehend.

13:46.810 --> 13:48.780
西班牙人总认识这个吧?
What's spanish for "ins"?

13:48.810 --> 13:49.780
别傻了
Don't be stupid.

13:49.810 --> 13:50.780
我们在墨西哥
We're in Mexico.

13:50.810 --> 13:51.980
你在这儿不能乱来的
You're the illegal one here.

13:52.010 --> 13:53.250
嘿  他可能在美国有家人
Hey, it doesn't mean he ain't got family up north

13:53.280 --> 13:55.850
正试图想要拿到绿卡呢
trying to clean their way to a green card.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.250
他懂我的意思
He knows what I'm talking about.

13:59.750 --> 14:04.110
我讨厌这个美国佬  但我需要他帮我

14:04.780 --> 14:07.220
我女友和我女儿遇上了麻烦

14:07.530 --> 14:09.440
我们要找的人

14:09.620 --> 14:11.310
是唯一可以救他们的人

14:11.630 --> 14:14.340
他用一个叫埃 斯塔姆的名字

14:15.540 --> 14:18.510
如果你有消息的话 请...

14:18.740 --> 14:20.470
...打这个电话

14:20.690 --> 14:23.050
我会非常感激的

14:33.710 --> 14:39.780
哦  你对我真好  苏珊宝贝
oh, you are too good to me, Suzi-Q.

14:42.580 --> 14:43.980
知道我喜欢这个
Mm. Just how I like it.

14:46.810 --> 14:49.080
我怎会如此幸运?
How did I get so lucky?

14:49.110 --> 14:50.250
哦  不  泰迪熊
Oh, no, Teddy bear.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.580
我才是幸运的那个
I'm the lucky one.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.910
我遇见你的那天...
The day I met you...

15:00.950 --> 15:05.010
是我重生的时刻
was the day I was born.

15:07.580 --> 15:09.880
我们到时间了
Mm. We're out of time.

15:09.910 --> 15:14.880
不  苏珊  我们要一辈子在一起
No, Susan, we got our whole lives together.

15:14.910 --> 15:17.350
不  我的意思是  一小时到了
No, I mean, the hour is up.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.280
我会非常用心的照顾你的  好吗?
I'll take care of you plenty, okay?

15:19.310 --> 15:20.310
我们都这么熟了
And since we're rolling here,

15:20.350 --> 15:22.280
所以让我们  你知道  回到...
so let's, you know, get back...

15:22.310 --> 15:24.110
怎么说呢-- 烹饪或者美容  怎么样?
how's it... what's cookin', good lookin'?

15:24.150 --> 15:26.380
如果你先付我些钱  我会感觉好点
I would really feel better if you paid me up front.

15:26.410 --> 15:28.850
那我先告诉你 如果你乖乖听话
And I told you up front that if you did this right,

15:28.880 --> 15:31.380
我会给你好处的的  所以呢...
I would take care of you, so...

15:33.310 --> 15:35.010
你只付了我一小时的钱
you paid me for an hour.

15:35.050 --> 15:37.110
现在时间到了
The hour is up.

15:37.150 --> 15:39.180
如果你想让我留下来  就得多付些钱给我
If you want me to stay, I need more money.

15:40.610 --> 15:41.880
很好  很好  气氛都被你破坏了
Great, great, you ruined it.

15:41.910 --> 15:43.050
不必了
Thanks.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.150
知道吗  刚才有那么会儿 我还挺喜欢
You know, for a second there,I was actually like,

15:47.180 --> 15:49.080
这个有情有义的妞
this chick has a brain in her head.

15:49.110 --> 15:52.450
你要真如此 就不可能在街上卖了 是吧?
Then, if you did, you wouldn't be a street whore, right?

15:52.480 --> 15:54.050
告诉你
You know,

15:54.080 --> 15:57.250
我压根就不知道这个叫苏西宝贝的贱人是谁
I don't know who this Suzi-Q bitch is,

15:57.280 --> 15:59.780
不过 怪不得她要跟你脱离关系了
but no wonder she wants nothing to do with you.

16:01.980 --> 16:04.810
你刚才称她为贱人  是吧
You didn't just call her a bitch, did you?

16:04.850 --> 16:07.510
好
Okay.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.910
我数到三
I am going to count to three,

16:09.950 --> 16:11.880
要是你还不放开手
and if you don't put your arm down,

16:11.910 --> 16:13.480
我就要喊了
I'm going to scream.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.410
一  二...
One, T...

16:47.750 --> 16:50.680
我们成功了
we made it.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.950
还没呢
Not yet.

16:51.980 --> 16:54.050
我们得先去见个人
First there's someone we need to see.

17:00.350 --> 17:02.880
有人想到什么了吗
Okay, who's got what?

17:02.910 --> 17:04.510
玫瑰中的耶稣
Christ as a rose

17:04.550 --> 17:05.680
是贯穿圣经各章的共同主题
is a pretty common theme that runs through the bible.

17:05.710 --> 17:07.480
马丁路德曾经在自己的族徽里面引用过
Martin Luther adopted it as his coat of arms.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.850
教徒们深信耶稣曾经死而复生
And there's the belief that Christ rose from the dead.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.980
这就是斯科菲尔德的最后一步棋 获得新生
This is Scofield's final step, a new life.

17:13.010 --> 17:14.210
新生 这里面可能有文章
Life. Could be something there.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.510
没错 你...
You...

17:15.550 --> 17:16.780
把这些记下来
keep track of this on the board.

17:16.810 --> 17:18.480
记在板上
On the board.

17:18.510 --> 17:20.810
-惠勒在哪儿?      -找到了
-Where's Wheeler? -Here we go.

17:20.850 --> 17:21.880
哈莫尼人
The Harmonists

17:21.910 --> 17:23.180
印第安纳州新哈莫尼地区的第一批定居者
first settlers of New Harmony,Indiana

17:23.210 --> 17:24.810
曾用一朵金色的玫瑰作为耶稣的象征
used a golden rose as their symbol for Christ.

17:24.850 --> 17:27.350
有这种可能
That's a reach.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.650
有种花就叫做耶稣玫瑰
There's a flower called the Christmas Rose.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.750
难道耶稣玫瑰指的不是那个德国代码吗?
Wasn't "Christ Rose" a German code name for, uh,

17:30.780 --> 17:33.980
那次直接导致帝国反击战的纳粹战役?
the counterattack by the nazis that led to the battle of the Bulge?

17:34.010 --> 17:35.380
在哪儿发生的?
Where was that?

17:35.410 --> 17:38.710
阿德雷丝森林 在比利时和德国边境的交界处
Ardennes forest on the Belgium-Germany border.

17:38.750 --> 17:39.810
就是那儿
Yeah,

17:39.850 --> 17:41.310
的确是个理想的藏身之所
not a bad place to hide

17:41.350 --> 17:42.510
如果他们找得到的话
if they can find it.

17:42.550 --> 17:43.650
你再查查看?
So you gonna look into that?

17:43.680 --> 17:45.780
对 没错 还有什么?
Yeah. All right, what else?

17:45.810 --> 17:48.150
耶稣是在复活节那天死而复生的
Christ actually rose from the dead on Easter.

17:48.180 --> 17:50.010
复活节日...
Easter Sunday...

17:58.550 --> 18:00.150
谁有斯科菲尔德的资料?
who's got Scofield's file?

18:00.180 --> 18:03.110
在我这儿 给你
Um, here we go.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.950
这儿
Here.

18:14.910 --> 18:16.550
玫瑰里的耶稣
Christ in a rose.

18:16.580 --> 18:17.450
这是什么意思?
Yeah, what about it?

18:17.480 --> 18:20.510
斯科菲尔德母亲的名字
Scofield's mother's name.

18:21.550 --> 18:23.450
克里斯蒂娜.罗斯.斯科菲尔德
Christina Rose Scofield.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.980
但我以为她过世了
Hmm, but I thought she was dead.

18:25.010 --> 18:27.050
恩 我也这样以为
Well, so did I.

18:35.980 --> 18:37.350
他们逃出福克斯河监狱后
The very first thing that Scofield did

18:37.380 --> 18:39.650
斯科菲尔德做的第一件事就是
when they broke out of Fox River is he picked up

18:39.680 --> 18:41.850
去墓地取回他事先藏好的物品
a bunch of supplies that he had stashed in a grave.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.050
我要你们去弄清楚斯科菲尔德的妈妈埋在哪儿
I want you to find out where Scofield's mother's buried.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.850
然后呢?
And what?

18:45.880 --> 18:47.780
看看她是不是被埋在那儿
And see if she's buried.

18:47.810 --> 18:48.780
是 长官
Yes, sir.

18:48.810 --> 18:50.380
-巴拿马是怎么回事?   -什么巴拿马?
-What about Panama?  -What about Panama?

18:50.410 --> 18:51.780
我们检查他的硬盘时
Well, when we found his hard drive,

18:51.810 --> 18:53.980
里面有很多信息是关于美国中部的
it was full of information about central America,

18:54.010 --> 18:55.080
尤其是巴拿马
Panama in particular.

18:55.110 --> 18:56.050
他肯定猜到了
Which he knows you have.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.580
这小子太狂妄自大了
The guy's got all kinds of hubris,

18:57.610 --> 18:59.710
但以他的智商 既然猜到你会在那儿等他
but he's smart enough to stay out of a country

18:59.750 --> 19:01.310
他肯定会远离那个国家
where he knows you'll be waiting for him.

19:01.350 --> 19:04.010
除非那儿有他需要的东西
Unless there's something there that he needs.

19:04.050 --> 19:05.210
或者人
or someone.

19:06.250 --> 19:07.710
我要一张巴拿马地图
I want a map of Panama,

19:07.750 --> 19:10.810
找出斯科菲尔德的妈妈 克里斯蒂娜.罗斯
and find out if Scofield's mom,Christina Rose,

19:10.850 --> 19:12.510
是不是在中美洲有家人
has any family in central America,

19:12.550 --> 19:13.850
或者财产
any property,

19:13.880 --> 19:15.250
任何东西
anything.

19:26.510 --> 19:28.610
上次我坐公车 就像这样
The last time I was on a bus like this,

19:28.650 --> 19:30.150
不过是去福克斯河监狱的
I was heading to Fox River.

19:30.180 --> 19:31.180
这个国家太棒了
This country's amazing.

19:31.210 --> 19:34.650
非常美
It's beautiful.

19:34.680 --> 19:35.680
这是什么味道 伙计?
What's that smell, man?

19:35.710 --> 19:37.310
香蕉
Bananas.

19:37.350 --> 19:38.310
还有甘蔗
And sugar cane.

19:38.350 --> 19:40.610
是巴拿马出口最多的商品
That's Panama's biggest exports.

19:40.650 --> 19:41.880
拜托
Come on.

19:41.910 --> 19:43.750
自从我们脱险后 你一直在说巴拿马和坐公车会很颠簸
You've been talking about Panama and bumpy bus rides ever since we broke out,

19:43.780 --> 19:45.950
现在我们已经上路了...
and now that we're actually doing it...

19:45.980 --> 19:48.450
她本应该和我们一起的
she should have been here with us.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.010
我们已经尽力了
We got all the time in the world for that.

19:51.050 --> 19:52.480
总有一天 你和莎拉...
Some ways down the track, you and Sara...

19:52.510 --> 19:54.250
我们安安静静地坐车 好吗?
can we just get there, please?

19:57.580 --> 20:00.010
当然
Sure.

21:08.110 --> 21:09.880
至今为止 在斯科菲尔德的妈妈和巴拿马之间
So far, no hits on any connection between

21:09.910 --> 21:11.910
还没有找到任何联系
Scofield's mother and Panama.

21:11.950 --> 21:14.680
但有38条与克里斯蒂娜.罗斯有关的信息
But there are 38 listings of Christina Rose

21:14.710 --> 21:16.380
各种各样的姓氏和名字的组合
in various combinations of first name,middle name and last name.

21:16.410 --> 21:19.610
好吧 交叉检索姓名和数字617
All right, cross-reference the names with the numbers 6-1-7

21:19.650 --> 21:21.050
纹身上的那个数字 也许他不代表日期
from the tattoo,Maybe it's not a date.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.510
试试看 它会不会是地址 信箱号什么的
See if it's an address, P.O. Box.

21:22.550 --> 21:23.680
好
Got it.

21:23.710 --> 21:25.580
只要有线索 就打电话给使馆
If anybody pops, call the embassy,

21:25.610 --> 21:27.510
让他们派人抓来那个女人问话
have them send an officer to pick up the woman for questioning.

21:27.550 --> 21:30.710
我想如没有任何确切证据的话...
Um, I don't think we can just

21:30.750 --> 21:32.650
-我们无权逮捕外国居民... -爱国法 兰探员
-arrest a foreign citizen without any...  -Patriot Act, agent Lang.

21:32.680 --> 21:33.880
我随时可以逮捕你奶奶
I could arrest your grandmother

21:33.910 --> 21:35.680
即使以丢失绣花针为由 只要我愿意
for missing a stitch in her macram,if I wanted to.

21:35.710 --> 21:36.880
只要有人在帮斯科菲尔德
If anybody's helping Scofield,

21:36.910 --> 21:39.280
无论是死人还是活人 我都要知道是谁
dead or alive,I want to know who they are.

21:47.810 --> 21:49.650
那个女人?
That her?

21:49.680 --> 21:51.210
对
Yeah.

21:56.510 --> 21:58.710
您好 瓦斯克斯太太
Hola, Mrs. Vasquez.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.150
你来晚了
You're late.

22:01.180 --> 22:03.410

她的电话就在别人手里
they got her phone.

23:02.180 --> 23:03.780
你想被抓吗?
You want to get caught?

23:20.010 --> 23:22.010

具体在哪得从斯科菲尔德的纹身上找答案
The key to exactly where is on one of Scofield's tattoos.

你把目标缩小到一个国家 我喜出望外啊
While I'm thrilled you've narrowed it down to a country,

23:38.150 --> 23:40.310

24:24.880 --> 24:27.180
那儿可要舒服多了
It'd be much more comfortable.

24:28.780 --> 24:32.650
我想我们得找个更安全的地方
I felt we needed to speak freely.

24:32.710 --> 24:39.380
接下来的这段时间 就是情报界所谓的盲点
the next several hours this is what those intelligence
ageney comunity refer to as a "blind spot".

马宏认为他们在巴拿马
Mr. Mahone seems to believe they're in Panama.

还要多久法院才会
How long until the court

25:55.420 --> 25:56.550
批准对马宏的逮捕令?

25:56.590 --> 25:57.920

Should be anytime now.

25:57.950 --> 25:59.490
我们在等起诉书

25:59.520 --> 26:01.390

要是他在这怎么办? 我不能一直躲着
What if he's in there? I can't keep avoiding him.

他很会察言观色 他是干这个的
He reads people. That's what he does.

26:06.390 --> 26:09.190
万一他知道了我有参与这事
And if he finds out that I'm involved in this,

26:09.220 --> 26:10.790
我需要人保护...
I'm gonna need some protection from...

26:10.820 --> 26:12.750
惠勒  冷静  深呼吸
Wheeler, relax. Take a breath.

26:12.790 --> 26:15.320
马宏只能知道你写给他的东西
The only thing Mahone can read is what you write for him.

26:15.350 --> 26:16.850
你只要做到
Can you act normal?

26:16.890 --> 26:19.720
表现得跟平常一样就可以了  我们绝不能让他逃了
That's all you have to do... the last thing we
want is for him to get spooked and take off.

26:19.750 --> 26:22.450
这一切就要结束了
This is all gonna be over soon.

26:22.490 --> 26:24.490
好的 谢谢
All right. Thank you.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.620
不  该谢谢你
No. Thank you.

26:33.150 --> 26:37.450
惠勒  你去哪了?
Wheeler. Where you been?

26:47.490 --> 26:49.320
我必须这样做
I got to do this.

26:51.290 --> 26:52.350
你干什么  阿历克斯?
What are you doing, Alex?

26:52.390 --> 26:54.490
我没有装监听装置
I'm not wearing a wire.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.620
你告诉我
You gonna tell me

26:55.650 --> 26:56.850
是怎么回事?
what's going on here?

26:56.890 --> 26:58.920
以前 在英国...
In old England...

26:58.950 --> 27:00.850
对背叛的惩罚是
the punishment for a traitorous act

27:00.890 --> 27:03.650
砍头
was beheading.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.950
行刑的时候
Following the execution,

27:04.990 --> 27:07.550
他们会揪住你的头发 使你的头抬起来
they would hold up the severed head by the hair...

27:07.590 --> 27:10.020
并不像一般人以为的那样 是为了让围观的人看你
not as most people think,for the crowd to see the head,

27:10.050 --> 27:12.220
而是为了让你看着下面的人
but for the head to see the crowd,

27:12.250 --> 27:14.420
因为砍掉脑袋之后 你还能有8秒钟的意识
because consciousness sticks around for another eight seconds.

27:14.450 --> 27:15.950
这样是为了让叛徒
The idea was that it would give the traitor

27:15.990 --> 27:17.720
最后看一眼...
one more chance to take a look at...

27:17.750 --> 27:18.990
你不会这么做  是吧?
you don't want to do this, okay?

27:19.020 --> 27:20.420
你耐心点...
Just take a moment...

27:20.450 --> 27:22.190
如果你要在背后刺我一刀
If you're gonna stab me in the back,

27:22.220 --> 27:24.720
惠勒探员  得注意
agent Wheeler, be smart enough

27:24.750 --> 27:25.750
先把刀藏好
to cover up the knife.

27:25.790 --> 27:27.190
你这个星期去见了
You go and visit Franklin

27:27.220 --> 27:28.250
富兰克林3次

27:28.290 --> 27:30.190
一天两次打电话给萨林斯?
called Sullins, what, twice a day?

27:30.220 --> 27:32.420
跟我这么久 你都学到什么了?
Didn't you learn anything working for me?

27:32.450 --> 27:35.620
干什么都要不留痕迹  除非...
You got to cover your tracks, unless you...

27:39.820 --> 27:41.490
除非你想被抓
unless you want to get caught.

27:45.190 --> 27:47.120
你想让我知道是你
You wanted me to know it was you.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.720
你是凶手 阿历克斯
You're a killer, Alex.

27:52.750 --> 27:54.050
是吗
Is that so?

27:54.090 --> 27:56.250
从你的花园提取的土壤样本
Soil samples taken from your yard

27:56.290 --> 27:58.250
显示和奥斯卡 夏尔斯的失踪有关
in connection with the disappearance of Oscar Shales.

27:58.290 --> 28:01.090

28:03.120 --> 28:04.490
提交一份详细的报告
David "Tweener" Apolskis.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.690
你无视双方约定
There's your blatant disregard for protocol

28:06.720 --> 28:08.150
对阿布鲁奇的死负有责任...
in the death of John Abruzzi...

28:08.190 --> 28:11.520
那个越狱犯说我让他自杀
and the escaped con who says that I told him to kill himself.

28:11.550 --> 28:14.050
你以为他的证词
You think his testimony is gonna

28:14.090 --> 28:16.950
能让你如愿以偿
send you into the promised land.

28:19.390 --> 28:21.650
你可以除掉我
You can erase me, too.

28:21.690 --> 28:24.190
但是除不掉事实
But it's not gonna erase the very real fact that

28:24.220 --> 28:26.550
那就是 你等在监狱度过余生吧
you're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison.

28:26.590 --> 28:28.720
你知道...
You know...

28:33.550 --> 28:35.890
你让我想起我还是个年轻探员的时候
you remind me of myself when I was a young agent.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.750
什么
What?

28:38.790 --> 28:41.050
我希望这是对我的赞扬
I wish I could take that as a compliment.

28:43.350 --> 28:45.520
你干得不错 惠勒
That's some real fine work, Wheeler.

28:45.550 --> 28:46.850
干得好
Good job.

28:48.090 --> 28:49.750
不要让别人吓唬到你...
Don't you let anyone scare you...

28:49.790 --> 28:53.520
从而去做错事
into doing the wrong thing.

28:56.820 --> 28:59.320
我带你进去
Let me take you in.

28:59.350 --> 29:01.390

嘿 听着 我哪儿也不去
Hey, look, I ain't going nowhere until

29:19.990 --> 29:22.220
除非你告诉我是谁要见我
you tell me who it is I'm meeting, all right?

29:23.220 --> 29:25.120
给我放手
You got to stop it.

29:25.150 --> 29:26.690
听我一句 行么
Listen to me for a second, all right?

29:26.720 --> 29:29.120

That's all you got to do is go out there and check.

29:29.150 --> 29:30.920
是不是一个长的有点高的
Guy's kind of tall, okay?

29:30.950 --> 29:32.890
你们绝不能这么做
It's the least that you can do.

30:02.390 --> 30:03.920
他说你会被释放
He says you're gonna go free,

30:03.950 --> 30:06.690
我们再也不必躲躲藏藏了
that we don't have to run anymore.

30:06.720 --> 30:07.950

30:09.050 --> 30:11.520
别担心了
Don't you worry about it.

你只需知道我已经把事情解决了
You just know that your man handles things.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.550
难道不是那样吗
Ain't that right?

30:15.590 --> 30:16.720
没错
That's right.

不过没关系
But okay.

你为何如此 兄弟
Whatever gets you through the night, buddy.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.580
你知道是什么让我惊讶吗 林肯?
You know what amazes me, Linc?

31:55.580 --> 31:58.250
你不关心任何事
Nothing ever registers with you.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.450
从来不
Ever.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.280
你把正义抛到脑后去了 不是吗?
Just rolls right off your back, doesn't it?

32:01.320 --> 32:04.350
我们毁了莎拉的生活 可是你并不在意
We ruined Sara's life and it's like you don't even care.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.280
-那你打算如何?         -我们在这里
-That what you think?  -Well, we're here,

32:06.320 --> 32:07.550
可莎拉回到监狱里去了
and Sara's back there in prison.

32:07.580 --> 32:09.380
-你认为公平么?   -世界本来就不公平
-Does that seem fair to you?  -None of it's fair.

32:09.420 --> 32:11.020
你可别把这跟你失去女友扯到一起
Just don't make this about boy loses girl.

32:11.050 --> 32:12.480
那这算什么 林肯?
Who should it be about, Linc?

32:12.520 --> 32:14.350
韦斯特莫兰德? 大卫?
Westmoreland? Tweener?

32:14.380 --> 32:16.150
-LJ? LJ的妈妈? -你给我住口
-LJ? LJ's mom? -Let me stop you right there.

32:16.180 --> 32:18.580
记得那个被杀的警卫吗
Remember the name of the guard that was murdered

32:18.620 --> 32:20.650
-死于我引起的骚乱的那个?        -闭嘴 迈克尔
-because of the riot I started? -Shut up, Michael.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.520
-还记得他的名字吗         -闭嘴
Do you even remember his name?  -Shut up

32:22.550 --> 32:24.350
那我敢说你一定记得维罗尼卡的名字吧 不是吗
I bet you remember Veronica's name though,don't you?

32:24.380 --> 32:26.220
你敢再提一次 我发誓...
You mention her name again, I swear to god...

32:26.250 --> 32:27.380
还有帝博格!
What about T-bag?

32:27.420 --> 32:28.920
林肯 他现在逃出来了 只因为我们
Linc, he's out there, now, because of us!

32:28.950 --> 32:30.750
你和我
You and me!

32:33.650 --> 32:36.220
他夺走的每一条生命
Every life he takes,

32:36.250 --> 32:39.750
我们手上都沾着血
that's blood on our hands.

32:39.780 --> 32:40.920
为了什么啊
And for what?

32:43.120 --> 32:46.380
不是我让你去做的
I didn't ask you to do what you did.

32:46.420 --> 32:48.250
他们会杀了你的 林肯
They were gonna kill you, Linc!

32:48.280 --> 32:50.150
是啊 你应该让他们杀了我
Well, maybe you should've let them!

32:50.180 --> 32:52.920
你居然这么说
Take that back.

33:18.380 --> 33:21.580
莎拉的状况再怎么糟糕
As bad as I feel about Sara,

33:21.620 --> 33:23.550
至少她还有的选择
she had a choice.

33:23.580 --> 33:26.820
但维罗尼卡没有
Veronica didn't.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.550
我听着她死去 迈克尔
I listened to her die, Michael.

33:31.580 --> 33:33.220
我听着她死去 可是
I listened to her die, and there was...

33:33.250 --> 33:35.120
可是我什么也做不了
there was nothing I could do.

33:35.150 --> 33:37.550
什么也做不了
Nothing.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.520
我们失去的太多了 兄弟
We've lost so much, man.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.980
我们不能再承受失去彼此
We can't afford to lose each other.

33:49.020 --> 33:51.350
我们不能
We just can't.

34:18.650 --> 34:20.820
要出门么 阿历克斯
You going somewhere, Alex?

34:20.850 --> 34:22.850
不知道 你说呢
I don't know. Am I?

34:22.880 --> 34:24.850
来吧
Come on.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.220
你知道我不喜欢把手弄脏
You know I don't like to get my hands dirty.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.980
这很让人惊讶吧 用恰当的方式刺激一个人
It's surprising the things a man

34:37.020 --> 34:38.550
可以让他为你做任何事
will do when properly motivated.

34:40.450 --> 34:43.820
这都是你让我做的
Wasn't it you who told me that?

34:43.850 --> 34:46.680
你知道 我会立刻杀了你 如果我觉得
You know, I would kill you right now if I thought

34:46.720 --> 34:48.920
那会让我获得哪怕一丁点儿平静
it would give me an ounce of peace.

34:50.780 --> 34:52.220
那你怎么才能平静
And what would give you peace?

34:52.250 --> 34:55.180
我撑到了现在
I've been able to hold it together

34:55.220 --> 34:58.150
经历了这么多
through all this...

34:58.180 --> 35:01.150
只因黑暗尽头的那一点希望
because there was a light at the end of the tunnel.

35:01.180 --> 35:03.120
生命...
Life...

35:03.150 --> 35:04.380
在黑暗的那一头
at the end of the tunnel,

35:04.420 --> 35:06.980
为我 为我的家人
for me, for my family.

35:07.020 --> 35:08.650
可是现在
And now what?

35:08.680 --> 35:10.650

Do you see my son?

35:10.680 --> 35:13.050

35:13.080 --> 35:14.420
我得到了什么
What have I got?

35:14.450 --> 35:15.780
你给了我什么
What have you given me?

35:15.820 --> 35:18.650
如果我告诉你
What if I was to tell you

35:18.680 --> 35:22.120
还有办法
that there was something that could turn that light...

35:22.150 --> 35:23.880
带回你的希望
back on?

35:23.920 --> 35:25.380
你会如何?
What would you say?

35:25.420 --> 35:27.550
你之前也是这么承诺的
I'd say that's the same offer you made

35:27.580 --> 35:29.280
当你把我拽进来的时候 你个小杂种
when you dragged me into this,you little bastard.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.620
现在你看看 我得到什么了
And look what it's got me now.

35:31.650 --> 35:33.180
他们会把我拉到公众面前
They're gonna drag me before the public.

35:33.220 --> 35:34.480
他们会起诉我 像个...
They've gonna prosecute me like-like...

35:34.520 --> 35:35.680
像个杀人犯
like some kind of murderer.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.720
还有 还有...证据
There's-there's... there's evidence.

35:37.750 --> 35:38.880
非常有效的

确凿的证据 没办法摆脱的

35:41.220 --> 35:43.350
对的
You're right...

35:44.550 --> 35:46.550
但是我可以帮你摆脱
but I can help you get away.

35:46.580 --> 35:48.450
况且现在
And at this point,

35:48.480 --> 35:51.780
我觉得你也别无其他选择
I don't think you've got any other options.

35:54.780 --> 35:57.820
