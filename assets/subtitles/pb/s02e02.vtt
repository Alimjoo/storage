00:10.900 --> 00:12.700

00:52.030 --> 00:53.860

00:56.560 --> 00:57.660
有人来了

00:57.700 --> 01:00.130
他怎么会找到这来?
How did he know?

01:00.160 --> 01:02.230
我们迟早会知道整件事的来龙去脉
It's only a matter of time before we know everything

01:02.260 --> 01:04.360
在斯科菲尔德脑子里 有一套周密的出逃计划
that is in Schofield's head--

01:04.900 --> 01:06.830
包括逃到哪 怎么个逃法
where he plans to run to   how he plans to get there--

01:06.860 --> 01:09.960
等到时机成熟 他就会按照计划执行
so when the time comes   that he does get there,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.660

we'll be waiting for him.

福克斯河狱长来电申请共同参与抓捕行动

告诉他 他已经无权再管这事
That he's no longer in it.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.200

02:58.960 --> 03:01.200
看到没 他们就是利用我们来挖洞
You see,they just used us to dig,man.

03:01.230 --> 03:03.230
我们不过是钻地鼠而已
We're gophers, that's it.

-迈克尔在哪?  -他马上到
Where's Michael? He'll be here.

Maybe you and I should go and get that $5 million,

03:09.430 --> 03:10.600

-怎么冷静? -嘿!

03:21.760 --> 03:24.330

03:57.230 --> 03:58.330

04:20.150 --> 04:22.050
吃完这顿咱们就分道扬镳了
This is the part where we say good-bye.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.530

It's not much.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.460
足够让你起步了
It's enough to get you started.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.160

04:34.560 --> 04:36.730

04:38.160 --> 04:40.600
我仅仅是想要25美分打个电话
I only ask for a quarter for a phone call.

04:40.630 --> 04:44.160
够你打四个的了
make farward

04:44.200 --> 04:46.030

你认为他死了吗?
Think he's dead?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.060
搞定了没?
are you done?

05:10.100 --> 05:12.460
还没有 我-我还要清洗一下伤口
No.I-I still have to clean it.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.200
这么说已经搞定了?
But you're done?

05:14.230 --> 05:17.230
是的
YeS.

05:39.880 --> 05:40.920
是时候出发了
it's time to move

05:41.960 --> 05:43.190
我们准备好了一切
We got everything we need.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.600
先到犹他州短暂停留一下 然后马上出发去墨西哥
Just a quick stop in utah and then we're off to mexico.

05:46.630 --> 05:48.000
LJ今天有个听证会
Lj has a hearing today

05:48.030 --> 05:50.730
会决定他是否按成人犯罪那样量刑
to determine if he gets tried as an adult.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.100
我能救出他
I can get hiM.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.040
时机不对
It's not the right time.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.040
那要等到什么时候?
When will it be?

05:56.040 --> 05:58.620
等我们到墨西哥后 等我们在新闻的焦点里消失后
after we went to mexico  After we're off the news.

05:58.630 --> 06:00.510
他被指控犯了两起杀人罪
They framed him for a double homicide.

06:00.530 --> 06:03.360
一旦听证没有通过他会和成人罪犯关在一起
As soon as he loses his hearing,they're going to ship him out to an adult facility,

06:03.380 --> 06:05.530
所以今天在法庭上是我救他的唯一机会
so today in the courthouse is my only chance to get him.

06:07.150 --> 06:09.590
他们害死了维罗妮卡他们不能再夺走我的儿子
They took veronica,they're not going to take my son.

06:10.060 --> 06:10.640
我明白
I know.

06:11.710 --> 06:12.550
我能理解

06:14.350 --> 06:15.690
我也绝不会丢下LJ不顾
I would - leave Ij behind

06:17.040 --> 06:18.140
但是我们现在不能这么做

06:19.240 --> 06:20.490
事先根本没做过计划
There's no plan in place.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.950
相信我 我对那法院很了解
Believe me,I know that courthouse.

06:22.970 --> 06:24.460
我都记不清去过多少次
I've been there more times than I can remember.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.550
看管他的只有一个法警
The only person guarding him's the bailiff.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.050
他只配备了催泪弹和警棍
He carries mace and a big stick.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.790
所以你打算暴力劫庭
So you're going to bum-rush the courthouse

06:29.800 --> 06:30.870
那是你的计划?
that's your plan.

06:31.960 --> 06:32.700
你真这么计划?
Are you serious?

07:14.980 --> 07:15.820

You never know,Michael.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.200
天知道

07:37.830 --> 07:39.700
把你知道的关于法庭的一切都告诉我
Tell me everything you know about the courthouse.

08:27.930 --> 08:29.160
睡过觉吗?
You get any sleep?

08:29.200 --> 08:30.500
睡了几小时吧
A couple hours.

08:30.530 --> 08:32.700
一下跑了八个 我到现在都无法相信
Eight of 'em, I still can't believe it.

08:32.730 --> 08:35.500
这简直就是场"成人秀"安排娘们在军队工作
This is Exhibit "A" why you don't let women work in the military

08:35.530 --> 08:37.240
在警局工作 尤其安排她们在男性监狱工作
the police force and especially inside a male prison, '

08:37.240 --> 08:39.530
看看你都得到什么回报?
cause look what you get.

08:39.550 --> 08:41.090
那娘们特意为她的相好斯科菲尔德不锁门
Dr. Sweetcheeks leaves the door open for

08:41.090 --> 08:42.470
才会有接下来发生的一切
Schofield and here we are.

08:42.470 --> 08:45.660
你这么说对某人不公平...
Sounds like there's a little bit more to the...

08:45.700 --> 08:47.430
如果不是唐克雷蒂不锁门
If Tancredi doesn't leave her office door unlocked,

08:47.460 --> 08:50.930
那八个混蛋这会儿 还不都乖乖呆在监狱内?
those eight dirtbags would in the shoe right now,okay?

08:50.960 --> 08:52.200
这才是关键!
Bottom line!

08:55.730 --> 08:56.900

08:59.200 --> 09:00.660

这案子已经移交给FBI.
It's been handed over to the FBI.

09:01.930 --> 09:04.160

12:07.820 --> 12:09.450

12:09.460 --> 12:10.650

except study the briefs.

尼克 萨维恩的律师号 是所有人当中最前面的
Nick Savrinn's bar number is on the front page of every one.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.830
我们想和LJ说话

12:33.350 --> 12:34.630

12:40.010 --> 12:40.910
贝利克警官

is it true that almost all the inmates  who either escaped or tried to escape

12:45.000 --> 12:48.360
都在监狱工厂干过活?
worked in Prison Industries?

12:48.650 --> 12:49.500

为什么这帮犯人 在监狱工厂工作的同时
Why did these inmates have so much time to dig a hole

12:52.310 --> 12:54.160
还有这么多时间挖洞?
in the floor of the guard's break room

12:54.170 --> 12:57.570
-而且还是在警卫休息室的地板上挖? -这个我能告诉你答案
while working Prison Industries? I can answer that.With all due respect,

12:57.580 --> 13:00.240
如果你们中的某个人 在监狱里工作过一天的话你就能明白
if any of you have ever worked a day in a prison,you would know that,

13:00.240 --> 13:02.340
因为每个犯人每小时只能挣到19美分
since an inmate only gets 19 cents an hour,

13:02.350 --> 13:04.820
所以肯定会磨蹭时间
some are bound to drag their feet.

13:07.310 --> 13:08.210
贝利克警官
Officer Bellick,

13:09.290 --> 13:13.400
你把管理监狱工厂的权利卖给出价最高的人 这是真的吗?
is it true you sold the right to run Prison Industries to the highest bidder?

13:13.410 --> 13:15.430
当然不 哪个该死的对你说的?
No. Who the hell told you that?

13:15.430 --> 13:17.020
这太难以置信了
This is unbelievable.

13:17.020 --> 13:18.940
我们在这里浪费时间
While we're wasting time in here,

13:18.940 --> 13:21.380
而外面还有八名罪犯在逃...
there are eight escaped convicts out there...

13:38.120 --> 13:41.190
你是否曾经受雇于福克斯河 担任教化警官一职  盖瑞先生?
Were you employed at Fox River as a correctional officer, Mr. Geary?

13:41.420 --> 13:45.390
-是的 -对 直到他因和犯人私下交易而被解雇
Yep. Yeah,until he was fired for shaking down inmates.

13:45.390 --> 13:46.820
你最好别再这么暴怒 警官
That will be your last outburst,Officer.

13:48.180 --> 13:49.620
你是否知道任何有关
Were you aware of any arrangement

13:49.630 --> 13:50.590
贝利克警官与监狱工厂的犯人
Officer Bellick had

13:50.590 --> 13:53.390
之间工作安排的内幕?
with any inmate regarding Prison Industries?

13:53.390 --> 13:55.050
是的 他把这个权利卖给了约翰 阿布鲁奇
Yeah,he sold it to John Abruzzi.

13:55.050 --> 13:55.910
约翰 阿布鲁奇
John Abruzzi--

13:57.060 --> 13:58.320
那不是在逃犯之一吗?
who was one of the escaped convicts?

13:59.080 --> 13:59.830
没错
Yep.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.050
你再不配合 我们不得不考虑替换别的狱警
We'll get other C.O.s to substantiate this if we have to,

14:03.060 --> 14:05.900
贝利克警官 我再给你次机会坦白交代吧
Officer Bellick, so I'm giving you one chance to get in front of it.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.060
你有没有把管理监狱工厂的权利出售给约翰 阿布鲁奇?
Did you sell Prison Industries to John Abruzzi?

14:12.750 --> 14:13.540
有还是没有?
Yes or no?

14:15.370 --> 14:17.180
有 但是当时
Yes,but at no time

14:17.180 --> 14:18.410
-我一点也不知道 -够了
was I aware of any talk That'll be all,

14:18.410 --> 14:19.460
-贝利克警官 -有关逃跑的事
Officer Bellick. of escape.

14:19.470 --> 14:20.300
够了!
That will be all!

14:21.800 --> 14:24.220
狱长 你可以和贝利克在走廊候着
Warden,you and Officer Bellick can step out into the hallway.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.490
我们商量好决定后再通知你们
We'll call for you when we've reached a decision.

14:53.430 --> 14:54.570
我去喝点咖啡
I'm going to get some coffee.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.590
这种情形下我已经竭尽所能
Well,I did my best under the circumstances.

15:01.850 --> 15:03.460
好消息是你的手由于冰冻及时
The good news, sir,is you had the hand iced,

15:04.130 --> 15:06.710
我可以把血管复原...
so I was able to restore blood flow and...

15:06.730 --> 15:07.490
指骨还是有些弯曲
The bones are bent.

15:08.190 --> 15:11.130
无论如何 我还是建议你尽快接受医疗护理
However,I recommend you get medical attention ASAP.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.030
与此同时 吃一些阿司匹林
Meanwhile,some aspirin

15:13.480 --> 15:15.110
有助于你降低血浓度 避免结块
will help thin the blood and avoid clotting.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.370
还有些抗生素和止痛片
Some antibiotics and painkillers.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.240
我经常会对宠物的主人说 把药片包上花生酱
I usually tell the owner of the dog, cat,whatever,to coat them with peanut butter

15:23.250 --> 15:26.700
这样更方便咀嚼 但是很明显你不需要这么做...
so they're easier to chew but,obviously,in your case...

15:26.710 --> 15:28.240
医生 你干的很棒
You did one hell of a job,Doc.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.570
谢谢
Well,thank you.

15:31.310 --> 15:33.540
你现在已经能够离开了
Well,uh... it's okay for you to leave now.

15:34.080 --> 15:34.960
噢对  我要走了
Oh,I'm leaving.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.530
但是你不能离开
You're not.

15:38.290 --> 15:39.430
-什么? -你听到我说的
What? You heard me.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.600
放心 我什么也没有看见
Look,sir, I haven't seen anything

15:41.620 --> 15:42.760
我也不会对任何人提及
and I won't tell anyone.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.280
你知道吗
Well,you know... you know,

15:45.310 --> 15:47.860
我曾经栽过一次跟头
I fell for that bill of goods once before.

15:48.980 --> 15:49.810
再也不会相信别人了
Never again.

15:51.630 --> 15:54.670
我对天发誓决不对任何人提及
Sir,I swear to God I will tell nobody.

15:54.670 --> 15:57.030
你会说的 那样我会在监狱中死去
You would,and I would die in prison.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.760
求求你 求求你了
Please,please, please.

16:04.770 --> 16:06.010
嘘!
Shh!

16:07.840 --> 16:08.990
现在你乖乖听话
Now,you did me a solid,

16:09.010 --> 16:10.480
这样我也可以回复温柔
so I'm going to return the favor.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.010
你不反抗的话 我会很温柔的让你离开这个世间
This can go down humanely if you don't fight,

16:14.030 --> 16:15.750
但是如果你再像刚才那样挣扎的话
but if you pull a stunt like that again,

16:15.760 --> 16:18.550
那就别怪我不人道了
it's going to get inhumane right quick.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.320
你来选择
Your call.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.300
前者还是后者...
But,one way or another...

16:25.100 --> 16:26.840
乖乖躺下吧 医生
I am putting you down,doc.

17:15.080 --> 17:15.830

你父亲和叔叔的这次越狱...
What your dad and uncle pulled off...

17:19.970 --> 17:20.890
给我留下非常深刻的印象

17:21.410 --> 17:22.840
我在这方面干了14年
I've been doing this 14 years,

17:23.290 --> 17:25.500
绝大多数的案件只能归类为偶然的运气
and most escapes can be attributed to dumb luck

17:25.510 --> 17:27.950
或者暴力所为
or brute force.

17:28.460 --> 17:31.250
就这件案子来看 计划的周密程度和复杂度

17:31.250 --> 17:33.430

酷 我们现在算朋友了
Cool. Now we're buddies.

17:47.070 --> 17:47.860

他们犯的谋杀罪冤枉到我父亲头上

这所有发生的一切 都来自上面的阴谋
Everything's been a setup coming from way up top.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.130
因为你为政府卖命
So the fact that you work for the government--

18:22.950 --> 18:24.200
我什么也不会说
I got nothing to say.

18:32.020 --> 18:34.750
楼下工作人员会给你同样的建议
I'll give you the same advice that you'd get from the guy working

18:34.750 --> 18:36.060
我再重复提醒你一遍
at the deli downstairs.

18:36.070 --> 18:38.710
现在你该好好为自己考虑一下了
Start thinking about yourself now.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.750
事实上 迟早都会面对到   没有人能够帮你渡过难关
In fact,the sooner the better, because no one--

18:42.340 --> 18:46.400
不管你父亲还是你叔叔

你已经16岁了 会被量很长的徒刑
And,at 16 years old,you're looking at a long stretch.

18:50.980 --> 18:52.010
你还有多少时间

19:06.280 --> 19:07.320
我愿意等你来和我谈条件

不要犹豫免得被别人抢了功劳
Don't wait and let someone else get the reward.

19:30.260 --> 19:31.180

What's up?

19:32.290 --> 19:33.520

希望那不会发生

当一个勇士在战场上杀死了另一个勇士
that when a warrior kills another in battle,

23:08.780 --> 23:13.370
他吸取了倒下的勇士的灵魂
he absorbs that fallen warrior's spirit.

所以这并非是你的终点 医生
So this isn't the end for you,Doc.

23:21.590 --> 23:22.680
你现在和我一体了

27:13.030 --> 27:14.990
你可以收拾所有行囊

27:15.010 --> 27:16.660
离开福克斯河了 处罚决定就这些
from Fox River; that will be all.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.960
我在...我在福克斯河
I've... I've worked at Fox River

27:20.960 --> 27:22.990
从18岁干起
since I was 18 years old.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.670
做一名狱警是我生命的全部
Being a C.O. is my life.

27:25.620 --> 27:26.780
我们很赞赏这点
And we appreciate that.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.150
我们本能够节省很多时间
POPE: Look,you know,we could have saved a lot of time

27:29.160 --> 27:30.710
如果一开始你就这么告诉我们的话
if you would have just told us in the beginning

27:30.720 --> 27:32.230
那这就是在草率定罪
that this was going to be a railroad.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.050
够了 狱长
That'll be all,Warden.

27:33.050 --> 27:33.960
只有一个人

27:33.960 --> 27:35.800
需要对越狱负责

27:35.800 --> 27:37.300
他的名字叫迈克尔 斯科菲尔德

27:37.310 --> 27:39.280
而不是贝利克警官 更不是我!
It's not Officer Bellick. It's not me!

27:40.840 --> 27:42.350
但是你们需要一个替罪羊 好吧
But you need a fall guy,fine.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.750
但是你不能就这样要了他的饭碗
But you're not gonna be just taking Officer Bellick's job.

27:46.410 --> 27:49.250
因为即使我不欣赏他的很多行为
Because even though I am not proud of many of his actions,

27:49.260 --> 27:50.960
把矛头指向自己人
it will be a cold day in hell

27:50.960 --> 27:53.200
会让人很寒心的
when I turn my back on one of my own men.

27:55.060 --> 27:55.790
我不干了
I quit.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.280
就这样吧
That will be all.

28:01.890 --> 28:02.960
如果这件事情弄砸了
If this thing doesn't work out

28:02.960 --> 28:04.660
你又会被关回福克斯河
and you end up going back to Fox River,

28:05.530 --> 28:06.590
而我去不了了
I ain't coming to get ya.

28:07.930 --> 28:08.520
我的意思是
I mean,

28:08.530 --> 28:10.920
你是用脑思考的斯文人 我只是个会用拳头说话的粗人
you are the brains and I am the brute.

28:17.740 --> 28:18.580
说真的 迈克尔
Seriously,Michael,

28:19.160 --> 28:20.100

29:31.970 --> 29:33.050
栽赃陷害你
of so many underhanded things,

29:33.060 --> 29:35.210
