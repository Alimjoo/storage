让他们用品质和智慧带领着国家的军队
so that each graduate is acommissioned leaderof character,

16:04.760 --> 16:11.430
效忠于荣耀 自由  和国家
committed to the values of honor,freedom and country

16:11.460 --> 16:17.460
但是 最重要的是 他们教会了我这个
But, first and foremost,they taught you this

16:35.360 --> 16:37.360
你们西班牙语里"樱桃"怎么说来着?
How do you say "cherries" again?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.360
Cereza.
Cereza.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.830
看来你得多弄些樱桃（Cereza）回来
Looks like you have to get more cerezas.

16:42.860 --> 16:44.660
宝贝  我刚给了你100个阿月浑子（一果实）
Baby, I just got you 100 pistachios,

16:44.700 --> 16:46.500
加了足够的盐
with the right amount of salt, too.

16:46.530 --> 16:47.830
是啊 它们得一起搭配着吃
Well, it's the combination.

16:47.860 --> 16:49.260
我两种都要
I need both.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.500
我为什么对你这么着迷呢?
Why am I a sucker for you, huh?

17:10.360 --> 17:12.160
什么? 她说什么
What? What's she saying?

17:12.200 --> 17:13.600
看起来像 帝博格
That looks like T-Bag.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.930
嘘
Shh.

17:20.130 --> 17:23.000
他说他正想从机场偷走行李
He said he was trying to steal luggage from the airport,

17:23.030 --> 17:24.400
但是...
but...

17:24.430 --> 17:27.700
他拿走了五百万  他怎么还要...?
he's got $5 million. Why would he...?

17:34.930 --> 17:37.300
除非他没有钱
Unless he doesn't have it.

17:37.330 --> 17:40.330
除非他的钱在那儿
Unless he lost it there.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.760
等一下 费尔南多  什么?
Stop it, Fernando.What?

17:41.800 --> 17:43.360
你真的认为
Do you really believe that

17:43.400 --> 17:45.630
那些钱在机场?
that money is at the airport?

17:45.660 --> 17:47.860
嗨  忘了它吧
Hey, forget it.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.230
看看我们现在一起拥有的
Look at what we have together.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.400
你想再为那个冒险吗?
Do you really want to risk that?

17:53.430 --> 17:56.330
我们有我们要的一切
We have everything that we need.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.530
除了你的樱桃（cerezas）
Except your cerezas.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.860
对了
Right.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.300
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

18:03.330 --> 18:05.100
费尔南多...
Fernando...

18:17.330 --> 18:20.830
我会马上回来
Hey. I'll be right back.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.330
你应该知道
You got to know

18:55.360 --> 18:57.700
对我来说 看出你是瘾君子并不难
it's not real hard for me to recognize a junkie.

18:57.730 --> 18:59.930
我   我  我
I'm... I'm... I'm...

19:01.460 --> 19:04.400
我是说 你看起来不太好
I'm saying you don't look so good.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.300
我没事
I'm fine.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.960
你服用的那是什么?
You mind me asking what you're taking?

19:13.660 --> 19:14.830
你也想要吗?
Here. You want one?

19:14.860 --> 19:16.330
不 算了 -给你
No, that's okay.-Here.

19:18.660 --> 19:21.260
留着以后能用
Save it for later.

19:23.430 --> 19:27.230
福拉特儿
Varatril.

19:27.260 --> 19:31.500
那可是苯甲酸镇静剂
Benzodiazepine's a hard-core tranquilizer, man.

19:31.530 --> 19:33.860
你每天都服用这个?
You take these every day?

19:33.900 --> 19:38.130
20毫克的剂量
20 milligrams.

19:38.160 --> 19:41.500
你一定感觉飘飘欲仙
You must feel like you're walking underwater.

19:41.530 --> 19:44.830
确实是这样
I do.

19:44.860 --> 19:47.830
有一种安祥的感觉
It's very quiet down here.

19:47.860 --> 19:49.460
就是这样 是吗?
That's why you started, right?

19:49.500 --> 19:51.200
安静无忧的感觉
Peace and quiet.

19:51.230 --> 19:53.630
不是仅仅因此你才磕药的吧 是吗?
That's not why you do it anymore, though, is it?

19:56.060 --> 19:57.660
现在只是头痛?
Now it's the headaches, right?

19:57.700 --> 19:59.560
也许你也睡不好觉
And you probably don't sleep.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.130
你也知道
And you know

20:02.160 --> 20:05.030
你会毁了你自己的 知道么?
you're going to destroy yourself, right?

20:07.000 --> 20:10.560
我并不排除这种可能性
I haven't ruled that out as a possibility.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.130
希望尽快得到你男友的消息
I hope we hear from your boyfriend.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.860
我和马宏有一个区别
There's one difference between me and Agent Mahone.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.400
他根本不清楚
He doesn't know

20:23.430 --> 20:24.660
你的价值
the value of a bird in the hand--

20:24.700 --> 20:26.530
他不停的旁听侧击
he just keeps beating and beating around that bush.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.960
但如果你不交出布伦斯 我可不在乎
But if you don't give up Burrows, I don't care.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.230
你们都得死
One down, one to go.

20:35.260 --> 20:37.600
我想和斯科菲尔德先生单独谈谈
I need to talk to Mr. Scofield.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.300
总统女士...
Madam President...

21:16.330 --> 21:19.330
我能...
could I...

21:19.360 --> 21:22.060
和你谈谈吗?
have a word?

21:22.100 --> 21:24.330
让斯科菲尔德和你单独在一起
It wouldn't be prudent for me

21:24.360 --> 21:26.860
会很危险的
to leave you alonewith Mr. Scofield.

21:26.900 --> 21:28.900
我的人就在门口
My men are right outside this door.

21:28.930 --> 21:30.160
我有我的隐私权
I have a right to privacy.

21:30.200 --> 21:34.860
你的权利与我无关
Your rights aren't my first concern.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.230
要不要我提醒你你在和谁说话?
Do I need to remind you who you are talking to?

21:37.260 --> 21:38.530
出去
Step outside,

21:38.560 --> 21:41.830
并记得把门关上
and close the door behind you.

22:05.700 --> 22:11.600
你为你哥做的一切挺感人的
The things you do for your brother.It's impressive.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.960
你又何尝不是如此
I could say the same for you.

22:16.630 --> 22:18.100
但我不说风凉话
But I won't.

22:18.130 --> 22:21.300
你听着 你的建议什么都不是
Bear in mind, your opinion means little to me.

22:21.330 --> 22:22.660
这盘磁带
This tape.

22:22.700 --> 22:26.960
现在在你身边吗?
You have it with you?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.400
不在
No.

22:29.430 --> 22:32.630
但我可以安排让你听下
But I can arrange for you to hear it.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.730
你没资格为我做安排 斯科菲尔德先生
You don't make arrangements for me, Mr. Scofield.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.200
我的人会的
I have people for that.

22:41.230 --> 22:43.960
我甚至怀疑
I'm not exactly sure

22:44.000 --> 22:45.730
这盘磁带里的内容
what is on this tape

22:45.760 --> 22:48.630
但我总感觉里面有点什么
but I doubt it's of any interest to me.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.600
里面是一段
It's a recorded conversation

22:50.630 --> 22:52.130
你和你弟弟的对话
between you and your brother.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.160
我和我弟弟一生中
Well, out of millions of conversations

22:54.200 --> 22:57.060
打过无数电话...
that I had with my brother during his lifetime...

22:57.100 --> 22:59.400
你说错了
I'll narrow it down for you.

22:59.430 --> 23:03.800
那是在他"死"后你们的对话
It was recorded sometime after his death.

23:05.530 --> 23:06.800
而这段
And this

23:06.830 --> 23:11.900
重要的对话...
particular conversation...

23:11.930 --> 23:15.160
能让你保全你的家庭
you might want to keep in the family.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.800
它在哪里?
And where is it?

23:19.830 --> 23:21.060
20种不同的拷贝
20 different copies

23:21.100 --> 23:23.930
分别在20个不同的地方
in 20 different locations.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.660
我现在就能打电话给我哥哥
I can call my brother right now.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.330
他能播放给你听
He can play it for you.

23:28.360 --> 23:29.830
不能在电话里
Not on the phone.

23:29.860 --> 23:31.760
让他带着磁带到这里来
Have him bring it here.

23:32.860 --> 23:34.760
这是我的条件
These are the terms.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.900
要么在电话听到
You can hear it over the phone,

23:38.930 --> 23:41.960
要么在新闻里听到
or you can hear it on the news.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.960
由你决定
It's up to you.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.160
我知道我是怎么开始的
I know it's why I started.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.400
开始什么?
Started what?

23:53.430 --> 23:55.060
吸毒
Using.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.500
和你的原因一样
Same reason as you.

23:56.530 --> 23:59.130
什么原因? 是因为你在医院实习期间得熬夜?
Why, because you had to stay up all night during residency?

24:01.700 --> 24:02.960
还是因为在所有女生面前
Because the bass player dumped you

24:03.000 --> 24:04.430
你的乐队男友把你当众甩了?
in front of the whole sorority?

24:04.460 --> 24:06.330
你和我真的有很多共同点
Yeah, you and I got a lot in common.

24:06.360 --> 24:09.060
我也见到过人的死亡
I've seen people die, too.

24:09.100 --> 24:13.360
我想不是你杀的吧
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.760
你需要帮助
You need help.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.000
这不是我所需要的
Not what I'm looking for.

24:23.660 --> 24:26.500
为了你好 希望你男友快点打来
For your sake, I hope your boyfriend calls back real soon.

24:50.130 --> 24:52.060
蒂亚?
Tia?

24:54.100 --> 24:57.030
玛丽克鲁斯?
Maricruz?

25:01.160 --> 25:03.530
人都去哪了?
Where the hell is everybody?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.060
妈妈
Mami.

25:12.430 --> 25:15.260
看哪! 这不是苏克雷嘛!
Hey... lookie here, good ol' Sucre.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.430
你对他们做了什么?
What did you do to them?

25:16.460 --> 25:17.530
他们在哪里?  玛丽克鲁斯!
Where are they? Maricruz!

25:17.560 --> 25:20.300
你冷静点
Hey, hey, hey, hey, keep your cap on.

25:20.330 --> 25:23.200
他们去摘苹果了
They're out picking apples for the Snuffleupagus.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.400
如果你...冷静点!
If you ever...Calm down!

25:25.430 --> 25:27.500
他们随时都会回来...
They're going to walk back in here any minute...

25:27.530 --> 25:29.800
这就会引起麻烦
which means trouble.

25:29.830 --> 25:31.430
除非你想让我
Now, unless you want

25:31.460 --> 25:35.100
看到你女朋友穿内衣的样子
to see me try out the new T-20Z on your bella muchacha, Mari-poon.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.430
...你最好跟我走
...I think you'd better come with me.

25:45.260 --> 25:46.860
你好?
Yeah?

25:46.900 --> 25:49.230
林肯 布伦斯?
Lincoln Burrows?

25:49.260 --> 25:50.900
卡罗琳 莱娜斯

25:50.930 --> 25:53.200
我知道

you have something for me.

26:00.360 --> 26:01.700
还在吗?
You still there?

26:01.730 --> 26:02.760
是的
Oh, I'm here.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.660
现在终于听到你说话了
It's good to finally talk to you.

26:05.700 --> 26:08.800
在那242个挣扎在死亡线上的夜晚
Wish I had the chanceone of those 242 nights

26:08.830 --> 26:10.700
我都希望有机会和你谈谈
I spent on death row.

26:10.730 --> 26:13.830
请你播放那盘带子
Please just play the tape.

26:22.730 --> 26:25.460
我知道这很糟糕
It's awful, I know.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.630
但我们已经作出决定了
But the choice was clear.

26:27.660 --> 26:29.900
你必须离这儿远远的
You needed to be far awayfrom all of this.

26:29.930 --> 26:30.960
我是啊
I am.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.760
我在特伦斯岛上
I'm the Isle of Terrence,

26:32.800 --> 26:34.230
大海的远处
far off to sea.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.160
我还是在你身边的
Look, I'm still here for you.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.700
不要总想着坏的方面
Now, listen to me, don't dwell on the negative.

26:39.730 --> 26:41.860
有的人注定要这样的 卡罗琳
Some people deserve to dwell, Caroline.

26:41.900 --> 26:45.000
我和你只有一个电话的距离
You know I'm only a phone call away.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.430
还有3000英里
And 3,000 miles.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.600
你...
Do you...

26:51.630 --> 26:52.900
你知道
Do you know

26:52.930 --> 26:55.030
这里有多冷吗?
how cold it is here?

26:55.060 --> 26:57.260
我们已经谈过这个了 特伦斯
We talked about this, Terrence.

26:57.300 --> 27:00.260
你会很孤独 但只是暂时性的
You knew that you would be lonely, but it's only temporary.

27:00.300 --> 27:03.330
对他的指控已开始移交审理
His appeals process has started already.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.030
比你想象中的还快
This is gonna fly by quicker than your 20s.

27:06.060 --> 27:10.060
不久人们就会淡忘他
And soon the world will forget all about him

27:10.100 --> 27:12.060
他们也会淡忘你的
and they'll forget about you, too.

27:12.100 --> 27:13.200
我答应你
I promise.

27:13.230 --> 27:16.000
但...
But...

27:16.030 --> 27:18.900
见不到你真让我痛不欲生
it's killing me not being able to see you

27:18.930 --> 27:20.960
亲爱的卡罗琳
sweet Caroline.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.960
我也很想见你
I want to see you, too.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.660
但现在真的不行
But that can't happen right now.

27:24.700 --> 27:27.300
这栋房子很大
This house is so big.

27:27.330 --> 27:29.630
我只是想着你...
I just think of you...

27:29.660 --> 27:31.430
躺在床上...
lying in bed...

27:31.460 --> 27:33.930
我知道 我也是
I know. Me, too.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.160
你的温存...
Your warmth...

27:35.200 --> 27:37.360
你的触摸
your touch.

27:45.300 --> 27:50.530
他走的很痛快吗?
Was it quick when he killed himself?

27:50.560 --> 27:54.060
比我父亲的死痛快多了
It was a lot quicker than how my father died.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.230
他们射中了他的背
They shot him in the back.

27:56.260 --> 27:59.330
他死在我的怀里
He died in my arms.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.530
我只想知道发生了什么
I just want to know what happened.

28:04.560 --> 28:08.060
你弟弟向我们道歉
Your brother apologized.

28:08.100 --> 28:10.000
他说他很抱歉
He said he was sorry,

28:10.030 --> 28:12.930
然后就打穿了自己的脑门
and then he blew his brains out all over the wall.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.860
那一瞬间 他没有感到痛楚
It was quick.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.830
那是他自己的抉择
And it was his decision.

28:18.860 --> 28:22.400
现在 该是你做出选择的时候了
And now it's time for you to make yours.

28:29.830 --> 28:31.130
不 不 不
Nah, nah, nah, man.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.600
我做不到
I can't do it.

28:32.630 --> 28:33.660
我绝不能这么做
I can't do that.

28:33.700 --> 28:35.300
你可以
Yes, you can.

28:36.700 --> 28:38.300
没有什么好怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.000
我想你不明白
You don't get it, do you?

28:41.030 --> 28:44.030
你阻止不了这个家伙
You can't stop this guy.

28:44.060 --> 28:46.460
没有你的合作我是阻止不了
Not without your cooperation,I can't,

28:46.500 --> 28:48.060
可是如果你肯告诉我
but if you talk to me,

28:48.100 --> 28:50.260
如果你肯把事实都说出来
if you tell me what's going on,

28:50.300 --> 28:52.830
我可以帮你
I can take care of you, okay?

28:52.860 --> 28:54.360
你必须相信我 富兰克林先生
You've got to trust me,Mr. Franklin.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.600
我可以帮你
I can help you.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.930
西诺 对吧?
C-Note, right?

29:02.100 --> 29:04.300
随便你
Yeah. Whatever, man.

29:09.060 --> 29:10.730
我只要你告诉我
All I need you to do

29:10.760 --> 29:13.500
马宏对你所说的一切
is tell me exactly what Agent Mahone told you.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.530
只要你告诉我马宏的事
If you give me Mahone,

29:16.560 --> 29:18.960
我就会让你拥有你想要的人生
I'll give you your life back.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.500
不瞒你说 神真的是站在我这边
God's been smiling down on me, I can tell you that.

29:22.530 --> 29:24.630
首先 我在阿尔戈马逮到了哈威尔
First, I caught up to Haywire up in Algoma.

29:24.660 --> 29:26.430
不过在他们把他带走之前
He did a swan dive off a grain elevator

29:26.460 --> 29:27.530
他便跳塔自杀了
before they could put him away,

29:27.560 --> 29:28.860
但是奖金我还是拿到了
but I still get the reward.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.260
等等 等等 他死了?
Wait, wait, wait. He's dead?

29:30.300 --> 29:31.960
没错 就像只不堪一击的小虫
Yep, like a gnat on a Peterbilt.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.660
但愿你不会步他的后尘
Hope you don't take the same route, Sucre.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.530
绝不 我还不能死
Oh, hell no, I got plenty reasons to live.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.600
我想你还舍不得福克斯河吧
I hope a few of them are in Fox River.

29:37.630 --> 29:38.860
如果你肯乖乖听话
Or maybe, if you play nice,

29:38.900 --> 29:40.730
我说不定会施舍几块
I'll throw your Maricruz a couple bills

29:40.760 --> 29:41.930
给你的玛丽克鲁斯
after I turn you in.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.030
抓到我你会得到多少钱?
How much are yougetting for this?

29:44.060 --> 29:45.260
十万
A hundred grand.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.400
你肯定想不到你个猪头还值这么多吧
I bet you never thought your ass'd be worth all that.

29:47.430 --> 29:49.430
等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait.Wait.

29:49.460 --> 29:53.660
要是我说能帮你弄到那五百万呢?
What if I know where you can get five million dollars?

29:55.830 --> 29:57.830
是真的
You heard me.

29:59.500 --> 30:00.560
在哪?
Where is it?

30:00.600 --> 30:02.300
如果你不把我带回美国
I could take you there,

30:02.330 --> 30:04.660
不把我送回监狱的话
if you didn't have to take me back to the States

30:04.700 --> 30:05.900
我就告诉你
and turn me back in.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.530
在哪里?
Where is it?

30:11.500 --> 30:14.230
帝博格就在这镇上
T-Bag's in town.

30:14.260 --> 30:18.330
我早在以前承诺过
I made my commitment a long time ago.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.600
我一定会
I agreed

30:19.630 --> 30:22.530
永远把国家放在第一位
to put my country ahead of myself,

30:22.560 --> 30:24.700
就像母亲奉献给孩子一样
like a mother does for a child.

30:26.900 --> 30:29.430
我以为
And I thought that

30:29.460 --> 30:32.100
我所做的一切都是崇高的  并且...
what I was doing was noble

30:32.130 --> 30:33.700
有一天会得到回报
and that I would be rewarded.

30:33.730 --> 30:35.560
你错了
You were wrong.

30:35.600 --> 30:39.600
难道你看不出我也不过是个棋子?
Don't you see that I'm a pawn in this, too?

30:39.630 --> 30:43.960
权力已经像癌症一样侵蚀了这个国家
The power that has taken over this country is like a cancer,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
而且完全无法阻止了
and it will stop at nothing.

30:47.030 --> 30:49.160
我已经无能为力
It is out of my control.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.800
此事也是如此
So is this.

30:50.830 --> 30:54.030
告诉我你到底想要什么
Tell me what you want from me.

30:55.630 --> 30:56.760
解开手铐
Uncuff me.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.560
我没有钥匙
I don't have the keys.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.660
那就去拿
You'll get them.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.030
然后 我要你让我在无任何监视的情况下
Second, I want you to arrange for me to walk away alone.

31:03.060 --> 31:04.600
一个人离开这里
No surveillance.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.160
好
Okay.

31:07.200 --> 31:10.530
最后...
And finally,

31:10.560 --> 31:15.560
我要一个总统赦免
I want a presidential pardon for me and my brother,

31:15.600 --> 31:18.600
完全赦免我哥哥和我
fully exonerating us of all our crimes.

31:18.630 --> 31:21.230
我今天就要
And I want it today.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.930
我不可能这样
I can't just hand out pardons

31:32.960 --> 31:34.630
想赦免谁就赦免谁
to anyone I choose.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.200
这是有程序和规定的
There is a process,rules.

31:36.230 --> 31:38.900
这也不例外
This is no exception.

31:38.930 --> 31:40.700
你将收到一份文件
A document will be delivered for your approval

31:40.730 --> 31:41.730
就和一般的赦免文件一样
just like any pardon.

31:41.760 --> 31:42.900
你签了它
You'll sign it

31:42.930 --> 31:45.000
然后转交于律政署
and then file it with the attorney general

31:45.030 --> 31:46.900
他们会将其记录
who'll submit to the presidential record.

31:46.930 --> 31:48.730
好 我签
Fine. I will sign

31:48.760 --> 31:50.300
你要我签什么就签什么
whatever you need me to sign.

31:50.330 --> 31:52.930
很好 但是你我都很清楚这还不够
That's very kind, but we bothknow that's not enough.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.700
你还想怎样
What do you want from me?

31:55.730 --> 31:59.000
我会亲自把你放走
I will unlock you myself, walk you out of here.

31:59.030 --> 32:00.360
难不成 还要我送你去机场?
What, you want me to drive you to the airport?

32:00.400 --> 32:02.160
我已经不像以前一样那么轻易信人了
I guess I'm notas trusting as I used to be,

32:02.200 --> 32:05.000
尤其是对那些一纸文书
especially with paperwork.

32:05.030 --> 32:07.000
太得不偿失
It's so easy to lose.

32:07.030 --> 32:08.260
所以 我要你趁这个现场直播的机会
No, I want you to go out there

32:08.300 --> 32:11.130
在所有人的面前宣布
in front of everyone

32:11.160 --> 32:13.430
对于我们的完全赦免
and announce our full pardon on live TV.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.600
你疯了
You're insane.

32:16.630 --> 32:17.960
事情不是这样
That is not the way

32:18.000 --> 32:19.300
就能解决的
things are done.

32:19.330 --> 32:21.700
人们会起疑心
This is not a vacuum--people will ask

32:21.730 --> 32:22.960
－会问问题   －赦免!
-questions.  -Pardon!

32:23.000 --> 32:23.960
现场
On stage.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.500
现在
Now.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.330
那..那我怎么确定
And-And how do I know

32:31.360 --> 32:34.830
事后你不会公布带子?
that you won't release the tape an hour later?

32:34.860 --> 32:38.260
你确定不了
You don't.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.600
你唯一能做的就是相信我
You'll just have to take my word for it.

32:41.860 --> 32:43.500
我需要更多保障
Well, I need more than that.

32:43.530 --> 32:45.960
你是不会得到的
Well, you're not going to get it.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.500
凯若琳...
Caroline...

32:51.530 --> 32:54.530
是时候了
it's time.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.960
赶快决定吧
Make your choice.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.760
亚当斯 帮他解开手铐
Adams, I need you to uncuff the detainee

33:04.800 --> 33:06.830
然后把他带到这
and bring him here

33:06.860 --> 33:09.000
让他走
to be released.

33:09.030 --> 33:12.130
你在干什么
What are you doing?

33:12.160 --> 33:14.400
我将会宣布
I am going to make an announcement

33:14.430 --> 33:17.700
斯科菲尔德和他哥哥无罪并让他安全离开
pardoning Mr. Scofield and his brother, and he will walk away unharmed.

33:19.230 --> 33:21.730
你疯了吗?
Are you out of your mind?

33:21.760 --> 33:25.300
他已经将一些无可争辩的证据暴光了
He has brought some indisputable evidence to light.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.100
我们马上就可以结束这一切了
We could end this all right now.

33:28.660 --> 33:30.160
而你却想让他们就这么给溜了?
And you're gonna let them walk?

33:30.200 --> 33:34.800
不要忘了  我是总统而你只是个奴才
am the commander in chief, and you are a corporate lackey.

33:34.830 --> 33:36.260
现在我要去发表演说
I am making the calls now;

33:36.300 --> 33:38.330
你没有任何权力来干涉
you have no authority.

33:40.800 --> 33:44.930
我的人会把斯科菲尔德先生送走
My men will see to it that Mr. Scofield walks away

33:44.960 --> 33:49.130
不许你和你的手下碰他一下
without the interference of you and your pit bulls.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.300
你一个人吗?
You alone?

34:24.330 --> 34:25.700
是的
Yeah.

34:26.460 --> 34:28.530
事情办好了吗?
How'd you do?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.800
三张船票 同一个船舱的 单程
Three tickets, one cabin, one way.

34:30.830 --> 34:32.230
太好了
Nice.

34:32.260 --> 34:34.200
算我欠你个人情
I owe you.

34:34.230 --> 34:35.200
不用  我们扯平了
No, we're even.

34:35.230 --> 34:37.230
这是给你的  谢谢
These are for you.  Nice.

34:37.260 --> 34:39.230
还有这个
And this.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.400
这是什么?
What's this?

34:43.430 --> 34:45.660
你逃出来后 埃迪用100块和我打赌
Eddie, when you broke out,bet me a hundred bucks

34:45.700 --> 34:47.160
说你过不了一周就会被抓回去
you'd be caught in a week.

34:47.200 --> 34:48.160
我说  不可能
I said, "No way.

34:48.200 --> 34:49.160
我认识的林肯绝不会这么差劲
Not the Linc I know."

34:49.200 --> 34:51.530
所以  我想和你平分这一百块
Figured I'd split it with you.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.300
可以了么?
So this is it, huh?

34:55.330 --> 34:57.800
恩
Yeah.

34:57.830 --> 35:00.000
祝你好运
Good luck.

35:01.730 --> 35:03.430
多加保重
You take care.

35:03.460 --> 35:04.760
你也是    好的
You, too. All right.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.360
你会没事的
You be safe.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.300
这地方你熟
Your neck of the woods.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.830
好  拉辛大街和第三大街交界处怎样?
Yeah, how's Third and Racine?

35:33.860 --> 35:35.100
我会去那儿的
I'll be there.

35:42.730 --> 35:45.560
我不想这么做  真的不想
I don't want to do this,I really don't.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.330
你在...你在说什么?
What are you, what are you talking about?

35:48.360 --> 35:50.230
但是你不能说  我没给过你机会
But you can't say that I didn't give you a choice,

35:50.260 --> 35:51.330
而你  你知道  你从未
but you, you know, you never

35:51.360 --> 35:52.330
弃暗投明...
take the easy way, you...

35:52.360 --> 35:55.660
而且我发现你  你...
And I noticed that about you, you...

35:55.700 --> 35:57.130
我并不希望事情变成这样
I didn't expect it to be any different

35:57.160 --> 35:59.660
但这是我的工作
but I have a job to do,

35:59.700 --> 36:01.600
是工作迫使我这么做的
a job that I'm being made to do.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.660
接电话  莎拉
Pick it up, Sara.

36:07.860 --> 36:09.430
莎拉  接电话
Sara, pick it up.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.530
快接电话!
Pick up the phone!

36:11.560 --> 36:13.000
等等  等等!
Wait, wait!

36:14.330 --> 36:15.760
别动
Don't move.

36:15.800 --> 36:21.130
听着  呃... 别  别动
Just, uh... don't, don't move.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.000
好的  我需要那个电话  把电话给我
Okay, I need the phone.Give me the phone.

36:24.030 --> 36:25.860
待在那儿别动
Stay right where you are,

36:29.060 --> 36:30.160
你不是真的想这么做吧
You don't really want to do this.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.360
你不知道我最想做什么
You don't know the first thing about what I want.

36:50.760 --> 36:51.800
收到我的短信了吗?
Get my message?

36:51.830 --> 36:53.200
是的
Yeah.

36:56.430 --> 36:57.500
我看到她了
I got her.

36:57.530 --> 36:59.260
她跑出来了
She's on her way out.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.500
跟着她  她会带你找到  斯科菲尔德的
Follow her; she'll take you right to Scofield.

37:22.860 --> 37:26.830
先生...我们得谈谈
Sir... we need to talk.

37:29.130 --> 37:30.400
再过几分钟
In just a few minutes,

37:30.430 --> 37:33.900
总统就会对
the president is going to announce a pardon

37:33.930 --> 37:35.530
布伦斯和斯科菲尔德  宣布特赦
for Burrows and Scofield.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.130
就象我们都知道的那样  这是一种背叛
As you're well aware,this is quite a departure.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.760
她一向都很合作
She's always been willing to play ball,

37:40.800 --> 37:43.260
但是我认为我们应该采取点行动了
but I think we need to take some sort of action.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.200
先生...
Sir...

37:47.960 --> 37:52.030
我也不希望打搅您  但是我不知道
I hate to disturb you,but I'm not sure

37:52.060 --> 37:56.360
您是否知道她这么做的严重后果
you realize the gravity of what she's about to do.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.830
迈克尔
Michael.

38:15.860 --> 38:19.000
莎拉  她同意了
Sara, it worked.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.960
特赦吗?
The pardon?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.430
她随时都会宣布的
She's announcing it any minute.

38:24.460 --> 38:27.460
哦  我的天啊
Oh, my God.

38:27.500 --> 38:30.160
哦... 哦  天啊 迈克尔  真是不可思议
Oh... oh, my God.Michael, that's amazing.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.230
快点过来  好吗?
Just get here, okay?

38:32.260 --> 38:35.560
我现在在...
I'm on, uh...

38:35.600 --> 38:37.000
高地
Highland.

38:37.030 --> 38:39.660
一个杂货店  一直沿着河往南走
It's a warehouse.It runs right down to the water.

38:39.700 --> 38:41.760
哦  好的  我这就过来
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.

39:20.060 --> 39:22.200
我们成功了
We did it.

39:22.230 --> 39:23.660
是吗?
Yeah?

39:25.260 --> 39:27.230
恩...
Um...

39:27.260 --> 39:28.530
兄弟 你的脸怎么了?
What happened to your face, man?

39:28.560 --> 39:31.830
如果你想搭顺风车的话
If you want to take the ride...

39:31.860 --> 39:34.200
就得付出点代价
...you got to buy the ticket.

39:34.230 --> 39:35.460
是啊  没错
Yeah, right.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.700
德里克帮我在货船找了个舱位
Well, uh, Derek hooked us up with a cabin on one of those freighters.

39:38.730 --> 39:41.030
经五大湖到南美的
South America via the Great Lakes.

39:41.060 --> 39:42.460
我们不需要那个了
We're not going to need that,

39:42.500 --> 39:46.030
但是真的很感谢他
but, uh, this is appreciated.

39:46.060 --> 39:47.960
再问一次  兄弟
One more time, bro.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.730
我们成功了?
We did it?

39:49.760 --> 39:51.460
没错
It's done.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.330
我们成功了
We're done.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.200
我  呃
I, uh,

39:56.230 --> 39:59.400
我真想看看她当时的表情
I wish I could have seen the look on her face.

39:59.430 --> 40:01.500
不  你看不到了
No, you don't.

40:02.430 --> 40:04.330
哦  不  我真想看看
Oh, yeah, I do.

40:07.830 --> 40:10.500
真让人难以置信
Unbelievable.

40:10.530 --> 40:12.130
她就要宣布了
She's going to do it.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.030
真是难以置信
Unbelievable.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.530
总统现在马上就要在
The president is now taking the stage here

40:19.560 --> 40:20.830
卡莱尔酒店发表讲话
at the Grand Carlisle Hotel.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.960
推迟了两个小时是因为
The two-hour delay in her appearance

40:23.000 --> 40:25.260
新闻秘书长 赖安博格对
due to an investigation characterized

40:25.300 --> 40:29.400
过分狂热者 的一个调查
by Press Secretary Ryan Berg as "an overzealous fan."

40:35.030 --> 40:37.760
你不是真想这么做吧
You are not going to do this.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.130
恐怕是的

40:39.160 --> 40:40.530

拜托别再来问我

40:45.300 --> 40:47.360
我想你还没弄明白
I don't think you understand.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.230
我们同样知道你的秘密
We know your secrets, too.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.000
而且可以轻而易举的揭发出来
And we can reveal them just as easily.

40:53.030 --> 40:55.530
你自己想想  孰轻孰重
You need to ask yourself who you fear more,

40:55.560 --> 40:58.660
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德  还是我们?
Michael Scofield or us?

40:58.700 --> 41:00.530
你还有30秒
You got 30 seconds.

41:00.560 --> 41:03.500
你自己看着办吧

41:03.530 --> 41:04.860
全世界都等着呢

41:04.900 --> 41:06.060
还有十秒

41:06.100 --> 41:07.130
女士们  先生们

41:07.160 --> 41:09.660
欢迎美国总统出场

41:09.700 --> 41:12.000
九  八  七

41:12.030 --> 41:14.460
六  五

41:14.500 --> 41:19.830
四  三  二  一

41:19.860 --> 41:24.960
感谢你们耐心的等了我一个下午
Thank you for waiting so patiently all afternoon.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.430
要不是你们  我的家乡父老
If it were not for the support of this great state,

41:29.460 --> 41:31.360
伊利诺斯州  人民的支持的话...
my home state of Illinois...

41:33.260 --> 41:35.700
谢谢
Thank you.

41:35.730 --> 41:37.000
我今天就不会
I would not

41:37.030 --> 41:38.360
站在这里了
be here today.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.130
这也是为什么  我要选择在今天
Which is why I have chosen today

41:40.160 --> 41:45.660
宣布这个重要的决定
to make this very important announcement.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.530
有件事情
A situation

41:47.560 --> 41:50.100
已经被人们逐渐的了解到
has recently come to light,

41:50.130 --> 41:52.960
而且我也感觉到  我必须要采取一些行动了
and I feel that I must take action.

41:53.000 --> 41:57.400
作为这个伟大国家的总统
It is my job as president of this great country

41:57.430 --> 42:02.700
当我知道真相的时候  就要做出理性的决定
to make rational decisions when I am given facts.

42:02.730 --> 42:08.800
而这种决定会惠及我们每一个人
Decisions that are best not for me, but for the people.

42:09.730 --> 42:13.660
所以经过了再三的考虑
And so, after much consideration,

42:13.700 --> 42:19.830
我很遗憾的通知大家
I regret to inform you

42:19.860 --> 42:21.400
我被诊断出患有严重的恶性肿瘤
that I have been diagnosed

42:21.430 --> 42:24.400
导致了癌症
with a highly malignant form of cancer.

42:28.700 --> 42:32.700
基于此缘由  我将不再适合
And because of that reason, I am no longer fit

42:32.730 --> 42:36.600
作为一个领导人  为大家服务了
to serve as your commander in chief.

42:36.630 --> 42:40.100
为了这个国家的利益
In the best interest of this country,

42:40.130 --> 42:42.330
我宣布这项决定  即刻生效
effective immediately,

42:42.360 --> 42:46.630
我将辞去总统的职务
I am stepping down as president of the United States.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.630
如果她不是总统的话 那盘带子就毫无用处了
If she ain't the president, the tape's useless.

42:58.660 --> 43:01.300
也不可能特赦任何人了
She can't pardon anyone.

43:01.330 --> 43:03.760
我们落空了
We got nothing.

43:08.230 --> 43:10.530
现在我们唯一能做的事 就是
There's only one thing we can do.

43:13.260 --> 43:16.360
我们得消失...
We got to disappear...

43:16.400 --> 43:16.700
永远消失
forever.
