Well, I didn't memorize them I wrote them in the book

17:34.920 --> 17:36.680
伙计们 我肯定他们还在四处找我们
I'm pretty sure they're still looking for us, guys.

do you see any boats?

18:55.110 --> 18:56.640

苏克雷正在赶过来 耐心点
Sucre is coming. be patient.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.320

23:15.440 --> 23:17.650
仍然没有任何线索 海滩上什么都没有
Still no sign of them. nothing on the coast.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.560
我想他们可能又返回了丛林
I think they may have gone back into the jungle.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.880
丛林? 是你让我派人去海滩的
The jungle? you asked me to send men to the beach

23:23.600 --> 23:24.800
队长
Capitan

23:24.810 --> 23:26.520
稍等下 长官
Just a moment, general.

23:38.910 --> 23:42.230
长官 我们需要联系海岸警卫队
General, I think we have to call the coast guard.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.300
抓好了
Come on

24:21.430 --> 24:23.070
你没事吧?
You all right?

24:23.940 --> 24:25.940
我的腿开始抽筋了
My legs are starting to cramp.

24:25.950 --> 24:27.640

You gotta hold on, buddy.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.230
迈克 这样下去 坚持不了多久
We're not gonna last out here too long, Michael.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.640
迈克 你的朋友呢?
Where's your friend, Michael?

24:31.650 --> 24:35.160
苏克雷不会就这样把我们抛弃的
Sucre's not just gonna abandon us out here, all right?

24:35.480 --> 24:38.580
他会来的 会来的
He'll show, he'll show.

24:41.050 --> 24:43.240
海岸警卫队已经出动了4艘船了
The coast guard is launching four vessels

24:43.250 --> 24:44.870
他们就这么一直泡在水里
They've been in the water this whole time.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.750
或许现在都沉到海底去了
They're probably at the bottom of the ocean by now.

24:48.940 --> 24:50.400
看看这个
Well, look it here

24:50.410 --> 24:54.390

24:57.890 --> 24:59.480
不顾及自己家庭呢?
take care of his family?

24:59.760 --> 25:01.430

25:01.440 --> 25:03.310
求你了 让我走吧
Please let me go

25:03.320 --> 25:05.300
他们都在等我
they are waiting on me.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.110
你哪也去不了
You're not going anywhere.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.940
我们处理好你的问题 才能放你走
Once we're done processing you, then you can go.

25:08.950 --> 25:11.040
乖乖做好 等吧
Until then, sit tight.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.710
这个点 我该听到些动静了
I should have heard something by now.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.720
我跟丢了所有的线索
I've lost all damn track of them.

25:24.730 --> 25:27.320
布鲁斯想要回他儿子 总会来的
Burrows will eventually reach out if he wants his son ck.

25:28.490 --> 25:30.760
没错 不过或许这样的筹码还不够
Yeah, well, that might no longer be an option.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.200
看啊 快看
Look look

25:59.830 --> 26:01.160
苏克雷

27:29.630 --> 27:30.580
你怎么会找到我们的?
How'd you find us?

27:30.590 --> 27:32.520
你后来再没现身 你说过你会来的
You never showed, and you said you'd be coming

27:32.530 --> 27:34.420
从西南方来 所以我来碰碰运气
From the southwest, so I took a chance.

27:40.070 --> 27:41.670
你认为苏克雷会发生什么事?
What do you think happened to Sucre?

27:41.680 --> 27:44.310

He's even worse off.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.240
还剩一个了
Guess that just leaves one.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.200
起来
Get up.

29:28.410 --> 29:29.910

Let's go.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.390
我在后排看到盒子 所以就把车开来了
I saw the boxes in the back, so I took your car

29:40.400 --> 29:41.890
猜想你需要换下装
Figured you'd need to change

29:42.220 --> 29:44.150
脚踝伤怎样了?
How's the ankle?

29:44.160 --> 29:45.550
真想把脚卸了
I need to get off my feet.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.290
好了 伙计们 换下装束
All right, guys, get changed and make sure

29:47.300 --> 29:49.050
确保没有落下任何湿衣服
You don't leave any wet clothes behind.

29:50.190 --> 29:51.660
听着
Listen, uh

29:52.050 --> 29:53.310
非常感谢

Yeah, me, too.

30:01.020 --> 30:02.820
我们回卡车去
Come. we need to get back to the truck.

30:04.290 --> 30:05.720
迈克?
Michael?

30:08.780 --> 30:10.280
谢谢你

30:39.890 --> 30:41.120
喂
Yeah?

30:41.130 --> 30:42.780
你们到底在哪呢?
Where the hell are you?

30:42.790 --> 30:46.020
我们遇到些麻烦 正在赶去巴拿马
We ran into some trouble. we're-we're downtown panama.

30:48.050 --> 30:50.370
不 林肯 你并没有去
No, Lincoln, you're not.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.630
有人跟来了
We got company.

30:58.770 --> 31:00.250
他们怎么能找到我们?
How'd they find us?

31:04.730 --> 31:06.340
你跟上他们了?
You have them?

31:06.510 --> 31:08.410
我们马上超上去了
We're right on top of them.

31:15.610 --> 31:16.930
抓紧了
Hold on

31:27.250 --> 31:29.740
他们或许盯上了格雷迪的老爸 对车动了手脚
They must've gotten to Grady's dad and bugged this car.

31:29.750 --> 31:30.750
或者是我们中的一个
Or one of us.

31:30.760 --> 31:34.180
那在水里的时候 他们怎么没有发现我们?
Then why didn't they find us when we were in the water?

31:34.190 --> 31:36.040
那是因为水阻隔了信号
It's because the water was blocking the signal.

31:36.050 --> 31:38.220
你还戴着格雷琴给你的手表干嘛呢?
What you do with that stopwatch that Gretchen gave you?

31:40.810 --> 31:42.010
天啊 我不知道
Oh, my god. I didn't know.

31:42.020 --> 31:43.240
我真不知道
I didn't know.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.640
好了 抓紧了 伙计们
Okay, hold on, guys.

32:00.410 --> 32:03.130
好了 这回该利用一下地形了
All right, it's time to use this rig to our advantage.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.640
我们上路吧
Go here we go

33:14.740 --> 33:17.100
这好像是条死路
Uh this is, like, a dead end right here.

33:17.470 --> 33:19.470
别呆在车里
Stay in the car, then.

33:22.850 --> 33:24.200
走这边
This way

33:59.170 --> 34:01.330
为什么你就是不招呢
Why don't you just tell us what you know?

34:01.590 --> 34:03.970
你不会想尝尝被打得半死的滋味吧
Then you won't wind up being beaten half to death

34:03.980 --> 34:05.960
-就像你的朋友一样 -我不比你知道的多
Like your friend. I know less than you do.

34:05.970 --> 34:08.750
孰轻孰重 你心知肚明
Which is hard, considering how dumb you are.

34:12.290 --> 34:14.230
我想知道逃犯留下的所有蛛丝马迹
I want everything you can find on the men who escaped

34:14.240 --> 34:15.880
我现在就想要
And I want it immediately.

34:17.750 --> 34:20.070
他怎么还在这里?
What the hell is he still doing here?

34:21.080 --> 34:22.380
除非是谋杀
Unless it's for murder

34:22.390 --> 34:23.830
让他出去
get him out of here

34:30.600 --> 34:32.410
去管办事员要你的东西
Go see the clerk about your stuff.

34:48.630 --> 34:50.100
他们被包围了
They're barricaded.

35:00.750 --> 35:01.720
你在干嘛
What are you doing?
