00:01.300 --> 00:03.230
《越狱》前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break

00:03.300 --> 00:05.160
刚刚来了位可信度极高的证人
A very credible witness has just come forward

00:05.230 --> 00:06.360
他愿意出庭作证
and he's willing to testify.

00:06.430 --> 00:09.160
你所有关于这项阴谋的供词他都愿意帮你作证
He'll corroborate everything you've said about this conspiracy.

00:09.160 --> 00:09.760
是谁?
Who?

00:12.460 --> 00:15.560
金先生  你对索娜了解多少?
How much do you know about Sona,Mr. Kim?

00:15.630 --> 00:17.260
我只知道要干掉她
Only what I've been given clearance on.

00:17.330 --> 00:19.530
我们已经转变了策略
There's been a,uh,change in strategy.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.760
我还要为你们做多少事?
How much further would I have to go?

00:20.830 --> 00:22.930
你只需要去趟巴拿马
For this,you only have to go to Panama.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.400
没想到你也来这儿了 迈克尔
I didn't know you were gonna be here,Michael.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.960
你在网上发消息给我说帝博格在这里
You e-mailed me.You said T-Bag was here.It's on the Web site.

00:27.030 --> 00:28.300
我从没在网上发过消息
I didn't write anything on no Web site.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.700
这里越看越象个圈套
This is looking more and more like a setup.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.860
玛丽克鲁兹被他关在某个地方
He's got Maricruz locked away somewhere.

00:31.930 --> 00:33.360
你要帮他找到那包钱
You're gonna help him get the money

00:33.430 --> 00:34.360
要不然她就死定了
or she's dead.

00:34.430 --> 00:36.300
站住  巴格威尔!
Freeze,Bagwell!

00:38.800 --> 00:41.860
是西奥多 巴格威尔 是他杀了里面那个女人
Theodore Bagwell he's the one you want for that dead chick in there.

00:41.930 --> 00:43.630
苏克雷  我们必须齐心协力
Sucre,you'd better pull it together.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.300
快去追钱  拜托了
Go get the money,please.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.130
你吓唬谁呢?
Who are you fooling?

00:51.200 --> 00:54.260
你不会杀我的  亲爱的迈克尔先生
You ain't going to kill me,Mr. Michelangelo.

00:54.330 --> 00:56.100
你下不了手的
You ain't got it in you.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.330
林肯?
Linc?

01:00.400 --> 01:03.060
- 你好  迈克尔- 你想干什么  亚历克斯?
-Hello,Michael.-What do you want,Alex?

01:03.130 --> 01:05.060
把钱拿来  船留下
Bring me the money,bring me the boat.

01:05.130 --> 01:06.760
你疯了
You are out of your mind.

01:06.830 --> 01:08.730
我们都有对方想要的东西
We both have something the other person needs.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.600
你这一切计划就为了救你哥
Your brother for your plan.

01:10.660 --> 01:12.960
给你5分钟  好好考虑一下
Five minutes.That's all you have.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.130
我没杀那个人  迈克尔
I didn't kill that man,Michael.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.860
我要带你离开这里
I'm getting you out of here.

01:28.230 --> 01:29.830
我只有三个星期了
I've got three weeks.

01:29.900 --> 01:31.930
只要我们留有信念
Just have a little faith.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.800
我已经尽力了
I did everything I could.

01:35.860 --> 01:37.330
我知道
I know you did.

01:50.530 --> 01:53.600
先生?
Sir?

01:53.660 --> 01:54.760
要口香糖吗?
Chicle?

01:54.830 --> 01:56.530
不需要
No.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.530
汽水呢?
Soda?

01:57.600 --> 01:59.430
那啤酒要吗  朋友?
Beer,my friend?

02:00.900 --> 02:03.300
来点兴奋剂?
Spleef? Magic mushrooms?

02:03.360 --> 02:05.300
提神醒脑  超级爽快
Burst your brains,split it wide open.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.230
先生  尽管放心我很可靠
I'm your man,man.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.360
这盒子里东西能带给你梦幻之旅
Magic Mystery Tour right here in this box.

02:10.430 --> 02:13.360
如果我这里没有 我可以帮你去其他地方拿
And if I don't got it,I can get it.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.060
走开
Beat it.

02:20.630 --> 02:24.060
想好该怎么做了吗?
So you gonna do the right thing?

02:24.130 --> 02:26.160
为谁做  亚历克斯?
Right for who,Alex?

02:26.230 --> 02:27.700
你输了  迈克尔
You lost,Michael.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.030
这就是你要的结果
That's what you've done here.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.530
你会失去很多东西
And you're gonna lose a whole lot more,

02:31.600 --> 02:34.030
除非此时此刻你跟我说
unless you tell me right here and right now

02:34.100 --> 02:35.730
你会把钱给我
you're gonna bring me the money,

02:35.800 --> 02:37.360
会把船留下
you're gonna bring me the boat.

02:37.430 --> 02:39.100
然后放了我哥哥?
And you'll just let my brother go?

02:40.300 --> 02:41.730
对
Yeah.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.200
就像你对付特维纳
Just like you let Tweener go.

02:43.260 --> 02:46.030
阿布鲁奇...
and Abruzzi...

02:46.100 --> 02:47.430
还有赫威尔那招一样?
and Haywire.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.500
事态不同了
Things are different now.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.500
是吗?
Really?

02:50.560 --> 02:52.700
对  我拼死拼活为他们效力
Yeah. The people I was working for,

02:52.760 --> 02:56.930
他们...他们却出卖我
they kind of, uh...sold me down the river.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.330
我现在只想远走高飞
Now I just want to go out to sea.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.930
那真是太有趣了 我会记住这句话的
Well, that's funny--I'll have to remember that one.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.930
我面临的牢狱之灾比你严重多了
I face more prison time than you.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.760
在我们共同的敌人名单里 我比你还要多几个
I sort of jumped ahead of you a few spots on the public enemy list.

03:07.830 --> 03:10.700
迈克尔  你是我拾回自由的关键  我与你也一样
You're my way to freedom,Michael, and I'm yours.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.460
我们都了解对方有多少能耐  快决定吧
We both know what the other one's capable of. Come on.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.330
让我们坦诚相见
Let's treat each other with a little respect here.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.630
不耍花招  什么都没有
No games. No nothing.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.260
就是两个人相互扶持
Just two guys doing each other a favor.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.460
觉得如何?
What do you say?

03:23.860 --> 03:25.430
你在哪?
Where are you?

03:25.500 --> 03:28.600
米拉弗罗尔斯海运码头就在巴拿马城的郊区
Miraflores shipping docks,just outside of Panama City.

03:28.660 --> 03:31.360
一个海上的大仓库
It's a big warehouse right on the water.

03:31.430 --> 03:33.100
那太远了
That's a long ways.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.300
我起码得花24小时才能到那
It'll take me at least 24 hours to get there.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.000
那我自己过来
Well, then, I'd get moving.

03:41.260 --> 03:43.700
亡命天涯的滋味如何?
How's it feel being on the run?

03:43.760 --> 03:45.860
我会幸免于难的
I'll survive.

03:45.930 --> 03:47.330
如果被抓就完了
Not if they catch you.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.300
他们会让你坐电椅
They'll send you to the chair.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.730
你觉得这是讽刺吗?
You think that's ironic?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.430
应该是正义
Think it'd be justice.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.460
金先生  我是亚历克斯 马宏
Mr. Kim, Alex Mahone.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.460
尽快回电
Call me.

04:01.030 --> 04:02.830
会有正义的
justice will be served.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.930
今天我在这里透露的一切
What I'm about　to divulge to you

04:07.000 --> 04:10.160
都将可能令我遭受杀生之祸
will in all likelihood　get me killed.

04:10.230 --> 04:12.100
其实我可以肯定这一点
Actually, I guarantee it.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.630
那为什么还要来?
Then why are you doing it?

04:15.700 --> 04:17.000
因为这样做貌似为国效力
Because this was supposed　to be about country,

04:17.060 --> 04:18.860
代表忠诚
about loyalty,

04:18.930 --> 04:21.430
彰显正义 但事实上并不是
about what's right,but it wasn't

04:21.500 --> 04:22.500
因为...
because...

04:22.560 --> 04:26.360
我陷害了许多不该陷害的人
I wronged people　who should not have　been wronged.

04:31.460 --> 04:34.400
命令都是由凯洛琳 莱纳斯下发的
Those orders were given　by Caroline Reynolds,

04:34.460 --> 04:36.930
就是曾经的副总统
who was Vice President　at the time.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.860
根据指示  我伪造证据...
Acting on those orders,I planted evidence...

04:40.930 --> 04:42.200
获取尸体
I procured a body,

04:42.260 --> 04:44.260
然后引诱林肯 布伦斯
I lured Lincoln Burroughs

04:44.330 --> 04:46.860
那晚来到那个停车场
into that parking garage　that evening

04:46.930 --> 04:48.930
制造一场不一样的谋杀案
under the auspices　of a different hit.

04:52.060 --> 04:55.000
从一开始  我们就在设计陷害他
From the ground up,we framed him.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.500
完美
Perfect.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.260
然后林肯 布伦斯被判死刑
So, Lincoln Burroughs　gets executed,

05:01.330 --> 05:02.660
人们开始遗忘特伦斯 斯蒂德曼
people forget　about Terrence Steadman,

05:02.730 --> 05:05.800
遗忘了对他的评论  还有他的职务
the controversy surrounded him　and the presidency.

05:05.860 --> 05:09.130
也没有人知道任何关于...公司的事
And nobody ever knows about...The Company.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.500
是的  就是一个阴暗的政治阴谋团体
yes, which is a shadowy　cabal of corporations

05:12.560 --> 05:16.230
影响着国家里发生的一切事
that pretty much influenceeverything that happens　in this country.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.730
但是我不明白你所说的一切
But I fail to see how any　of this is relevant

05:18.800 --> 05:22.430
跟莎拉 唐克雷蒂协助他人越狱
to Sara Tancredi and the fact　that she aided and abetted,

05:22.500 --> 05:23.560
逃避拘留有何关系...
that she jumped bail...

05:23.630 --> 05:25.060
她这么做是担心自己的生命安全
She did so because she　feared for her life,

05:25.130 --> 05:26.860
而且合情合理
which was appropriate,

05:26.930 --> 05:29.000
因为我接到命令要杀了她
cause I had orders to kill her.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.860
你还在卖仙丹吗?
Are you still　in the magic business?

05:59.930 --> 06:01.330
卖到天长地久
Siempre.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.660
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

06:02.930 --> 06:04.630
恰克
Chaco.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.700
已经很明显了
It's all here.

06:07.760 --> 06:11.160
克里曼所说的一切 都证实了文件上的内容
Everything Mr. Kellerman said　is corroborated　in these documents.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.600
鉴于现在的证据
In light of this evidence

06:12.660 --> 06:19.600
请问原告律师   你还要继续控告唐克雷蒂医生吗
my question, I guess, to you　is whether your time　and resources
are　best spent　in pursuing charges　against Dr. Tancredi.

06:19.600 --> 06:25.130
不会  事务所决定立即撤消对她的所有控告
No. My office will drop　all charges,effective immediately.

06:26.630 --> 06:32.660
但是法官大人  我想花时间和精力 起诉这个人  克里曼先生
But, Your Honor,I would like　in prosecuting this man,Mr. Kellerman.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.830
警官
Officer.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.500
我不知道该跟你说什么
I-I literally don't even know　what to say to you.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.930
很高兴能认识你  莎拉
It was good knowing you, Sara.

06:55.800 --> 06:56.730
喂?
Yeah?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.060
现在在哪?
Where are we?

06:58.130 --> 06:59.830
巴拿马  很惬意的城市
I'm in Panama. Nice place.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.660
晴空万里  微风拂面
Good weather. Cool breeze.

07:02.730 --> 07:04.700
我问你那对兄弟在哪?
Where are we with the brothers?

07:04.760 --> 07:06.630
你在半道截住他们的时候
When you get them　where they need to be

07:06.700 --> 07:08.700
我会亲自赶来证实
I want to come down there　for visual confirmation.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.300
那我建议你乘飞机来
Then I suggest　you get on a plane,

07:10.360 --> 07:12.030
因为当你到这的时候
because by the time　you get here,

07:12.100 --> 07:14.700
我已经抓到斯科菲尔德和布伦斯了
I will have Scofield and　Burroughs where you want them.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.830
然后一切都会结束
And then this　whole thing is over.

07:29.030 --> 07:31.200
莎拉  是我
Sara, it's me.

07:31.260 --> 07:33.500
我知道这有点奇怪...
It's a strange thing...

07:33.560 --> 07:37.030
给一个永远收不到信息的人留言
leaving a message　for someone you know　is never gonna get it.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.960
我只能做这种最坏的假设  所以...
I can only assume　the worst, so...

07:42.030 --> 07:47.930
这会是我给你的最后一条留言
this will be the last message　I leave for you.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.160
我只是想告诉你我成功了
I just wanted you to know　that I made it.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.860
不过少了你  我很失望
But it's no good without you.

07:58.930 --> 08:01.160
不管如何  还记得...
Anyway, you remember when I...

08:01.230 --> 08:03.230
还记得我跟你说过...
remember when I told you　about those...

08:03.300 --> 08:07.360
在芭雅的欢乐时光有50美分啤酒吗?
50-cent beers　in Baja at happy hour?

08:07.430 --> 08:10.360
这里的啤酒比那更便宜
They're even cheaper down here.

08:10.430 --> 08:14.730
如果奇迹出现  你听到这留言的话...
If by some miracle,you do get this...

08:14.800 --> 08:17.430
我希望你能听得更真切些
I need you to listen close.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.260
莎拉...
Sara...

08:22.330 --> 08:24.800
莎拉  还是让我们陪你出去吧
Sara, I suggest　we get you out of here.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.600
外面有大把的记者
It's going to be　a media circus outside.

08:26.660 --> 08:28.560
还会来更多的  走吧
It'll only get bigger.Let's go.

08:28.630 --> 08:30.330
好的
Sure.

08:30.400 --> 08:36.230
今天在芝加哥法院对莎拉  唐克雷蒂医生 的审判中爆出猛料
Larger, unexpected fireworks　at the trial　of Dr. Sara Tancredi　in Chicago today.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.230
新的证词暗示了
New testimony has implicated

08:38.300 --> 08:42.460
前总统莱纳斯女士合谋...
that former President Reynolds　was complicit

08:42.460 --> 08:44.160
在其哥哥特伦斯 斯蒂德曼 谋杀案中弄虚作假
in the falsification of...

08:47.660 --> 08:52.300
正受全国通缉的 被陷害凶手林肯 布伦斯
Purported killer　Lincoln Burroughs　who has fled the country　on a nationwide manhunt

08:52.360 --> 08:55.930
将会立即被撤消所有控诉
will be exonerated　of all charges　effective immediately.

08:57.660 --> 08:59.930
我的天哪  布鲁斯 林肯自由了
Oh, my God, Bruce,Lincoln's a free man.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.260
迈克尔留了个言
Michael left me a message.

09:39.330 --> 09:41.400
我的天
Okay... my God.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.830
他不知道这件事 还在准备逃亡
He doesn't know.He's still planning on running.

09:46.900 --> 09:51.530
快接电话  迈克尔  快点
Uh... Come on, Michael,come on, come on.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.000
我会介绍你们认识
Let me do　the introduction.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.260
可以  不过要让我来具体谈
All right, but I'll　do the talking.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.800
没问题
Si

10:03.800 --> 10:05.060
没办法 我要赶去告诉他
Okay, I got　to go to him.

10:05.130 --> 10:06.430
莎拉  那可在3000里之外啊?
What that, about　3,000 miles, Sara?

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
确实很远 所以我们现在速回酒店打点行装
It is. So we're going to　have to swing by my hotel

10:08.560 --> 10:10.430
你只管送我到机场就好
and you're going to have　to get me to the airport,

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
布鲁斯  因为我一定得告诉他 再也不用亡命天涯了
because, Bruce, he's got to know　he doesn't have to run anymore.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.400
他现在干的事情可能会令他丧命
What he's doing right now　is going to get him killed.

10:19.860 --> 10:22.860
老板  事情终于搞定了
The stars are finally　aligning, sir.

10:22.930 --> 10:24.660
马宏抓住了布伦斯
Mahone's got Burrows.

10:24.730 --> 10:26.030
斯科菲尔德也快了
Scofield's on his way.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.200
索娜呢?
SONA?

10:27.300 --> 10:28.660
我会处理好的
I will make it happen.

10:28.730 --> 10:30.530

I... We talked about getting back together,

11:10.300 --> 11:11.500

about giving it another shot.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.400
没错  我也说过或许能再回首
Yes, and I said that maybe we could.

11:17.530 --> 11:18.500

11:25.530 --> 11:26.900

11:26.970 --> 11:28.230
我现在离那里不远
I'm not far from there

11:28.300 --> 11:30.870
我就在想何不借此良机
right now,and I was thinking

11:30.930 --> 11:33.230
团聚一场享受天伦之乐?
that why not just stick around and have you guys come down?

11:33.300 --> 11:35.170
你不是一直想去的吗?
You always wanted to go, didn't you?

11:35.230 --> 11:36.400
回故乡看看?
Visit the homeland?

11:36.470 --> 11:38.270

Yes, but you didn't.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.130

听着亚历克斯  或许这会行不通
Alex, look, it might not work out.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.500
你要做好思想准备
You've got to be prepared for that, okay?

12:00.570 --> 12:03.700
不可能再像过去那样
I... It can't be like it was before.

12:06.270 --> 12:08.530
永远不会恢复到原先那样

你现在什么担心都不用了
You've got nothing to worry about, okay?

12:39.970 --> 12:41.400
我只嫁给你
It's you I'm marrying.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.100
冈萨雷斯先生...

12:45.400 --> 12:47.490
你在干吗

12:47.830 --> 12:49.390
准备离开

12:49.570 --> 12:51.350
那太荒谬了  你刚刚失血过多休克

12:51.530 --> 12:53.350
流失了3品脱的血

12:53.530 --> 12:56.160
相当于你体内30%的血啊

12:56.380 --> 12:59.410
会导致肾衰竭、脑缺氧 甚至会害你丢了性命

13:08.610 --> 13:09.230

14:22.500 --> 14:25.270

我帮你物色了个极有钱的家伙

15:08.450 --> 15:10.780
这位不速之客是谁？

15:11.000 --> 15:11.630
-别激动  我们来谈生意的 -滚出去

15:12.030 --> 15:12.730
有人告诉我可以做个交易

关系到10万美金

16:05.000 --> 16:12.130
查询超过30秒 就把你扔下运河喂鲶鱼

这样是没有出路的
There's no way out of this.

23:42.230 --> 23:43.200

好的 我去检查一下
All right, I'll check it out.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.630
在法国保卫战中 敢于面对纳粹的刽子手
In the French Resistance it was considered a high honor

26:36.700 --> 26:38.000
是莫大的荣誉
to face a Nazi firing squad;

我记得我告诉过你安静点

26:39.760 --> 26:41.030

如果你一直乘船

27:12.630 --> 27:14.300

27:14.360 --> 27:15.560

这里的这艘船
This boat here,

27:22.330 --> 27:23.460
是谁的？
who's it belong to?

27:23.530 --> 27:24.500

27:24.560 --> 27:25.930
我们接到举报

27:28.000 --> 27:29.300
不是这艘船 老兄
It's the wrong boat, pal.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.430
你可以检查下 但是  嘿 你不能...
You can check it if you want to, but...

27:34.130 --> 27:35.400
朋友  这里是巴拿马
This is Panama, friend.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.700
开始熟悉起这的法律吧
Get acquainted with the law, huh?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.900

28:02.500 --> 28:03.660
你觉得他们抓到他了吗？
You think they got him?

28:03.730 --> 28:04.860
那是艘很特别的船
It's a pretty singular boat.

28:04.930 --> 28:07.160
可以运很多的可卡因
That's a lot of coke to be carrying around.

28:07.230 --> 28:08.430
如果你掌舵的话  伙计...
If you're at the helm, man...

28:08.500 --> 28:10.900

28:12.460 --> 28:13.530
我们没了船
We lost the boat.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.400
至少我们搞到了那个死人的钱

28:16.460 --> 28:18.500
我们的余生无忧了
It's out ticket to the rest of our lives,

29:54.200 --> 29:55.560
而且他供认了一切
and he made a full confession.

Are you serious?

29:56.630 --> 29:57.930
没有

29:58.000 --> 29:59.900

30:12.360 --> 30:15.230
这样说的话...

30:15.300 --> 30:17.060
意味着你不用再逃了
That means you don't have to run anymore.

30:21.730 --> 30:23.700
那迈克尔呢?
What about Michael?

30:25.200 --> 30:26.830
我爸有个朋友正着手这事
a friend of my father's getting into it,

30:26.900 --> 30:30.700
不过根据目前的情况 他很确信
but he's pretty confident that under the circumstances

30:30.760 --> 30:32.500
没人会再为这事追究你的责任
nobody's going to pursue you on this.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.660
我得找点喝的
I need a drink.

30:40.430 --> 30:42.730
那我去看看有什么
I'll go see what I can find.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.100

Here.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.230
帮我解开这个
Help me out of this.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.430
我们成功了林肯

No...

31:21.200 --> 31:22.930

you almost did it.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.010
你想要钱?
You want the money?!

31:36.510 --> 31:38.710
这就是  拿去
Take the money. Take it.

31:38.780 --> 31:41.550
你以为这是钱的问题吗?
You think this is about the money?

31:44.050 --> 31:46.580
把500万当作零花钱?
Pocket change like five million?

31:46.650 --> 31:47.880
那又为了什么?
Then what is it about?

31:47.950 --> 31:49.750
我哥被赦免了
My brother's been exonerated.

31:49.810 --> 31:51.110
总统下台了
The President stepped down.

31:51.180 --> 31:53.880
我们不再威胁任何人 一切都结束了
We're not a threat anymore.It's over.

31:53.950 --> 31:56.050
你跟我们完了
You may be done with us,

31:56.110 --> 31:57.750
并不意味着我们跟你也完了
but that doesn't mean we're done with you.

31:57.810 --> 31:59.580
警察就在路上
The police are on their way.

31:59.650 --> 32:01.780
这事由我引起的
It started with me.

32:01.850 --> 32:03.210
放我弟弟走

32:03.280 --> 32:05.080
噢 太感人了

32:05.150 --> 32:06.050
真是太感人了
That's sweet.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.650
可惜你再也听不到了
You don't hear that much anymore,

32:08.710 --> 32:10.350
听不到这种兄弟间的忠诚
that sort of fidelity in families.

32:10.410 --> 32:13.980
兄弟俩为了对方而逃到天涯海角
Two brothers that'll go to the ends of the earth for each other.

32:14.050 --> 32:16.950
只可惜你们要有一个为此付出代价
Too bad only one of you survive.

32:17.010 --> 32:18.050
不要
Don't!

32:30.250 --> 32:32.080
赶快跑
We got to go.

33:48.810 --> 33:50.950
如果你们不投降出来
My men are ordered to fire if you don't

33:51.010 --> 33:52.510
我们就开枪了
come out of there with your hands first.

33:53.710 --> 33:55.180
来
Come on, come on.

33:58.680 --> 34:02.210
在巴拿马谋杀可不是闹着玩的
Murder is not something that we take lightly here on Panamanian soil.

34:02.280 --> 34:05.110
所以快出来投降
So come on out of there

34:05.180 --> 34:06.880
这样就不会有人伤亡
and there will be no more death.

34:06.950 --> 34:09.410
迈克尔我杀了人
Michael, I took a man's life.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.050
不要这么想
Don't think about that now.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.480
你和我之间有个约定  记得么?
You and I have got a date,remember?

34:14.550 --> 34:15.750
两杯柠檬汁  两杯啤酒
Two limes and a couple of beers,

34:15.810 --> 34:16.910
没忘吧

34:16.980 --> 34:19.580
最后警告你们一次!
This is your last warning!

34:19.650 --> 34:21.250
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

34:24.050 --> 34:25.580

and we'll tell them exactly what happened.

34:35.010 --> 34:37.210
看看我  看着我
Look at me,look at me, look at me.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.280
我们要去告诉他们到底发生了什么
Then we're going to tell them what happened.

34:39.350 --> 34:40.880
好
Okay.

34:40.950 --> 34:43.180
我们会把一切都解释清楚的
We'll explain everything.

34:43.250 --> 34:47.180
我会尽力帮助你
And I'm going to do whatever I can to help you.

34:47.250 --> 34:48.980

Don't move!

35:45.280 --> 35:46.250
我会开枪的!
I'll shoot!

35:46.260 --> 35:49.910

38:41.050 --> 38:43.410
我也在考虑这个问题
That's the thing.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.050
计划出现了"小波折"
There's been a hiccup.

38:46.050 --> 38:48.050
"小波折"
A hiccup.

38:48.050 --> 38:49.380
听着  你们把我给抓了
Look, you got me...

38:49.380 --> 38:51.350
在墨西哥光明正大地把我给抓了
you got me fair and square in Mexico,

38:51.350 --> 38:52.750
难道这还不够?
all right?

38:52.750 --> 38:54.780
我已经按你的要求去做
I did what you wanted me to do.

38:54.780 --> 38:56.050
现在该放我出去了吧 正如之前说好的那样
Now it's time to cut me loose just like we agreed.

38:56.050 --> 38:58.410
我们之前可没说好你要被警察抓住
Getting caught wasn't part of the agreement.

38:58.410 --> 39:03.680
我被抓是为了成就你的诱捕
I got caught running your setup,being your bait.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.010
现在我把斯科菲尔德给引来了
Now I got you Scofield down here,

39:05.010 --> 39:06.210
我已经按你的要求去做了
I got you what you wanted.

39:07.610 --> 39:10.710
可你被抓了 巴格威尔
You got caught, Bagwell.

39:13.050 --> 39:15.180
你去哪?
Hey, wh... where...where you going?!

39:15.180 --> 39:16.680
你去哪?
Where you going?!

39:16.680 --> 39:18.610
你要的我都给你做到了
I got you what you want!

39:18.610 --> 39:20.850
那几个崽子我都给你引来了
I got them boys down here!

39:20.850 --> 39:24.250
我都按你的要求去做了
I did what you told me to do!

39:24.310 --> 39:25.980
你听到了没有?
Do you hear me?!

39:25.980 --> 39:28.980
你要求的我都做到了
I did what you told me to do!

39:28.980 --> 39:30.010
你要求的我都做到了
I did what you told me!

40:41.480 --> 40:43.310
我们到了
This is as far as I go.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.080
将军...
General...

41:13.080 --> 41:16.910
我相信在这跟你说件事很安全
I trust this is a safe place to speak.

41:16.980 --> 41:19.250
关于斯科菲尔德的
It's Scofield.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.880
逮住他了
They got him.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.310
斯科菲尔德回到了狱中
Scofield back in the penn.

42:02.310 --> 42:04.150
老实说
Got to be honest,

42:04.150 --> 42:06.210
这样不一定有用
didn't think we'd see it happen.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.280
要知道  他还是会想办法逃出去
You know he's gonna break out.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.750
那是他的天性
It's in his blood.

42:13.750 --> 42:16.510
让他逃吧  这正是我们所期待的
That's exactly what we want him to do.
