Anyone who knows anything has got to be dealt with.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.420

唐克雷蒂就是个累赘
Tancredi was becoming a liability.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.590
这只是一个交易

01:34.600 --> 01:36.850
500万美金值得我搏一记
$5 million worth of business.

01:36.860 --> 01:39.590
这就是我们共患难的结果?
So this is how it's going to go down, huh?

01:39.600 --> 01:43.100
我们共同经历了所有的事
After everything.

01:44.030 --> 01:45.620
贼就是江山易改本性难移
Once a thief, always a thief.

01:45.630 --> 01:46.990
你才意识到啊?

02:33.500 --> 02:36.650

纹身小子  你们不还是好兄弟吗?
Thought you was compadres, tattoo?

警察随时都会到
The police are going to be here any second.

我绝不能容忍那傻大个带着
Ain't no way I'm letting that- that dunderpate

02:51.900 --> 02:53.720
五百万跑了…
ride off with five...

02:53.730 --> 02:57.730
你们自己决定吧
It's your choice.

03:02.560 --> 03:07.130
放心没什么事
It's all right.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.450
别担心  给你这个  然后...
all right, I'm going to give you this, and, uh...

03:13.460 --> 03:14.890
大约一个小时后你就可以
you should be able to cut yourself free

03:14.900 --> 03:18.700
割断绳子重获自由
in about an hour.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.590
伙计  你有什么计划?
So what's the plan, man?

03:20.600 --> 03:22.220
你想做什么都行
Well, you can do what you want.

03:22.230 --> 03:24.820
我让帝博格那个变态逃过一次
I let that psychopath t-bag loose once.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.020
我不会再让他逃脱惩罚
I'm not going to do it again.

03:27.030 --> 03:31.860
警察来的时候给他们留个小礼物
Make a nice little present for the police when they get here.

我不知道
I don't know

03:46.960 --> 03:50.460
好运

03:59.830 --> 04:04.230
他们会抓到你的
They're going to get you.

04:18.530 --> 04:20.050
唐克雷蒂小姐
Ms.Tancredi.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.490
我并不想吓到你
I didn't mean to startle you.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.220

04:23.230 --> 04:24.990
没什么好怕的
No reason to be frightened.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.790

对你父亲的死我深表遗憾

04:38.330 --> 04:43.130

04:43.700 --> 04:46.120
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

04:46.130 --> 04:47.590
让人确信我没像之前那样吸毒
Making sure it doesn't look like I did!

04:47.600 --> 04:48.850
如果州长自杀的当天
People will ask questions

04:48.860 --> 04:51.120
他女儿也被发现死于非命 现场还留有搏斗痕迹
if the day the governor was found killing himself

04:51.130 --> 04:55.790
那么人们肯定会产生疑惑
his daughter is found dead in what looks like a struggle.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.790
那么  好吧
Well, then.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.120
如果他们找不到她呢?
What if they don't find her?

05:01.130 --> 05:04.390
很明显州长的女儿为了避免牢狱之灾
In an apparent attempt to avoid jail time,

05:04.400 --> 05:08.720
在保释中逃走并消失了
the governor's daughter skips bail and disappears.

05:08.730 --> 05:10.920
我们在说你最后的几分钟  唐克雷蒂小姐
We're talking about your last minutes, Ms.Tancredi.

05:10.930 --> 05:12.490

06:30.060 --> 06:32.550

What? Too much?

06:32.560 --> 06:36.600
干得漂亮
You were great.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.790
老兄  这东西真他妈的重
this thing is freaking heavy, dude.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.820
并捎上他父亲给她的爱

06:50.830 --> 06:51.890

06:51.900 --> 06:54.220
富兰克林怎么办?

06:54.230 --> 06:55.420
我总觉得整件事有点不太好
I feel kind of bad about the whole thing.

06:55.430 --> 06:56.950
我们没法知道该不该信任他
There's no way to know if we could trust him.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.190
等我们到了巴拿马
Once we get down to Panama

06:58.200 --> 06:59.350
我们再往他家里汇些钱吧
we'll send something up to his family

06:59.360 --> 07:00.520

07:05.000 --> 07:09.290
我真不敢相信  我就要成为...

07:09.300 --> 07:13.320
见鬼钱到哪去了?
where the hell is the money?

07:13.330 --> 07:17.600
见鬼钱到哪去了?
Where the hell is the money?

07:43.530 --> 07:48.130

10:19.550 --> 10:21.140
钱不在屋里
The money's not back at the house

10:21.150 --> 10:25.500
除非帝博格还在那儿

他一定是把背包换了
He must've switched the packs.

10:28.010 --> 10:29.440
那...?
wh-what do we do...

10:29.450 --> 10:31.140

这里还有5千美元
We still got the five grand we took

10:33.410 --> 10:35.640

10:39.910 --> 10:41.640
各单位注意

10:41.650 --> 10:44.770

真难以置信这个节骨眼上把我招回
I can't believe they're calling me back here

11:26.780 --> 11:28.000
那些逃犯都还逍遥法外

I want to know who this guy is.

11:29.580 --> 11:33.140

好久没和你坐下来谈谈了吧?

What can I get for you boys?

12:29.480 --> 12:30.270
你看呢
You tell me.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.900
两杯水吧
Two waters, then.

12:32.910 --> 12:36.470
知道你是好心人  让我用下电话吧
And the use of your phone, if you'd be so kind.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.810
别担心  只打个市内电话而已
Don't worry, it's a local call.

12:41.550 --> 12:45.370
我回家第一件事就是换条干净的内裤
First thing I do, we get home: Clean underwear.

12:45.380 --> 12:46.400
然后呢?
Then what?

12:46.410 --> 12:47.470
可能会回那个便利店
I guess go back to that liquor store

12:47.480 --> 12:51.180
求他们让我继续干下去
beg for my job back.

12:54.380 --> 12:55.740
我们曾有过机会
We had it.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.940
可惜擦肩而过
We were so close.

12:57.950 --> 13:01.740
我甚至还能依稀闻到那钱的味道
I can still taste that money right there in the back of my throat.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.100
我现在不考虑别的
Well, nothing that a couple of Keystones

13:03.110 --> 13:04.800
只想美美地吃上一顿汉堡肉饼
a hungry man salisbury steak dinner

13:04.810 --> 13:09.410
然后坐在电视机前看看电视
and a night in front of the TV won't take care of.

13:10.350 --> 13:14.040
嘿  妈妈  是我
Hey, mom, it's Brad.

13:14.050 --> 13:18.500
我和罗伊的车子出了点问题
Hey, listen, me and Roy, we ran into some car trouble and...

13:18.510 --> 13:20.600
你能否来接我们
we were wondering if you could come pick us up.

13:20.610 --> 13:22.240
不知道  等一下
I don't know, hold on.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.900
这该死的小镇叫什么?
What the hell town is this?

13:23.910 --> 13:26.440
你不是说仅打个市内电话吗
Thought you said this was a local call.

13:26.450 --> 13:28.570
嘿  布拉德利  看看这个
Hey, Bradley, check this out.

13:28.580 --> 13:29.740
别挂  妈妈
Wait, mom.

13:29.750 --> 13:32.070
据报道这些人就是
These individuals were reportedly the prisoners

13:32.080 --> 13:37.500
几天前从伊利诺斯州福克斯河监狱逃出来的逃犯
who escaped from the fox river penitentiary in Illinois just a couple of days ago.

13:37.510 --> 13:39.970
他们到底来犹他州的图勒镇做什么?
What were they doing all the way out here in Tooele, Utah?

13:39.980 --> 13:43.100
根据珍妮特 欧文斯所说
Well, Jeanette Owens

13:43.110 --> 13:44.300
她的车库被这些人挖开了
whose garage they dug up, has her own theory.

13:44.310 --> 13:50.300
他们假装成电力公司的工作人员
They pretended that they were some kind of workers from the power company,

13:50.310 --> 13:53.100
然后说这里有些问题
and that they had made a mistake

13:53.110 --> 13:56.370
他们必须挖开修复
and they'd have to do some digging.

13:56.380 --> 13:57.770
妈  我又想了想
Hey, mom, on second thought

13:57.780 --> 14:00.700
你能不能给我们汇点现金?
uh, can you wire us some extra scratch?

14:00.710 --> 14:04.580
事实上  我们还要办点事
Turns out, we ain't done yet.

14:18.550 --> 14:19.670
你好
Hello.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.970
布鲁斯  你得帮帮我
Bruce, I need your help.

14:20.980 --> 14:22.170
莎拉?
Sara?

14:22.180 --> 14:24.470
布鲁斯  我爸爸不是自杀的  知道吗?
Bruce, my father didn't commit suicide, okay?

14:24.480 --> 14:26.900
冷静点  你在哪?
Okay, just calm down. Where are you?

14:26.910 --> 14:28.340
他正在调查布伦斯的案子
He was looking into the Burrows case

14:28.350 --> 14:29.600
我想他发现了一些
and I think that he found something

14:29.610 --> 14:30.970
别人不想让他知道的事情
that they didn't want him to know.

14:30.980 --> 14:33.540
我想现在他们认为我也知道了这些事
And now, I think that they think that I know it, too.

14:33.550 --> 14:35.000
好吧  我要你听我说
All right, I want you to listen to me.

14:35.010 --> 14:36.500
我派人来接你
I'm gonna send someone over to pick you up.

14:36.510 --> 14:40.440
我先把你接回来 我保证我们一起把这事彻底解决
I'll bring you back here, and we'll sort all of this out, I promise.

14:40.450 --> 14:41.700
告诉我你在哪里
Just tell me where you are.

14:41.710 --> 14:43.870
我不知道  我在一个电话亭...
Uh, I don't know, I'm at a pay phone on...

14:43.880 --> 14:46.040
第三大道和哈柏路的交叉口
Third and Harper.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.940
你带手机了吗? 到时我可以联系你
Do you have your cell in case I need to reach you?

14:47.950 --> 14:50.400
带了  但我想一定已经被监听了
Uh, I do, but I-I thought it would be tapped.

14:50.410 --> 14:51.300
我不知道
I don't know.

14:51.310 --> 14:52.940
好吧  我的人过去了
All right, someone's on their way.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.240
待在那
Just stay right where you are.

14:54.250 --> 14:58.350
谢谢
Thank you.

15:06.910 --> 15:09.170
我出价80元
I'll give you 80 bucks for them.

15:09.180 --> 15:10.500
不是吧  伙计 他们值...
Come on, man, they're worth...

15:10.510 --> 15:11.570
对真正的主人来说
worth a lot more

15:11.580 --> 15:13.540
当然远不止这个数
to the person they actually belong to.

15:13.550 --> 15:15.970
这些是女子俱乐部的东西  伙计
These are ladies clubs, doctor.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.200
我想她们比你那男人短裤
I'm guessing they're hotter

15:17.210 --> 15:19.370
可要性感多了
than a monkey's jockstrap

15:19.380 --> 15:22.510
80元
80 bucks.

15:24.180 --> 15:29.250
加上那个冰块盒的话就成交
Throw in the cooler, and you got a deal.

15:32.310 --> 15:33.640
我们必须丢弃这辆车了
We got to lose the bike.

15:33.650 --> 15:34.870
不行
No way.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.200
路都被封了
The roads are sealed.

15:36.210 --> 15:37.570
这是我们从这里出去的唯一的办法
It's the only way we're gonna make it out of here.

15:37.580 --> 15:38.870
老兄那我可办不到   我答应过皮提...
I can't, bro.I promised petey...

15:38.880 --> 15:41.070
你不能把这辆车弄过河去
you're not getting that thing across the river.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.800
我们浪费一分钟就少一分钟  明白吗?
And every minute we spend trying is a minute we don't have, okay?

15:44.810 --> 15:46.770
对不起
I'm sorry.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.050
我们得走了
We got to move.

15:58.210 --> 16:00.840
我听说过这种地方
I've heard about these kinds of places.

16:00.850 --> 16:01.940
有水蛭的  你知道吗
They got leeches, you know.

16:01.950 --> 16:04.400
我宁愿被这里的水蛭咬
I'll take the leeches in here

16:04.410 --> 16:06.140
也不愿被后面追兵拷住
over the handcuffs back there.

16:06.150 --> 16:07.100
那可不好说啊
I don't know, papi.

16:07.110 --> 16:08.640
要看这些水蛭咬什么地方
Sort of depends on where the leech leeches

16:08.650 --> 16:11.880
-知道我说什么吗? -别开玩笑了
-you know what I'm saying? -Stop kidding around.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.470
你还好吧  兄弟?
Are you all right, buddy?

16:26.480 --> 16:29.200
我...我动不了了!
I can't... I can't move!

16:29.210 --> 16:31.140
有什么地方受伤的吗?
You feel like you broke anything?

16:31.150 --> 16:32.500
没有  我想应该没有
No, I don't think so.

16:32.510 --> 16:33.600
能不能把这个?
Can you get it?

16:33.610 --> 16:37.450
把它从我身上移走?
Can you get it off me?

16:43.110 --> 16:44.500
一点都推不动
This thing's not going anywhere.

16:44.510 --> 16:48.210
我下去看看你的脚
I'm gonna check your foot.

17:02.510 --> 17:03.840
真不幸  伙计
I'm sorry, buddy.

17:03.850 --> 17:07.950
卡住了
It's stuck.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.380
你去打911
you, call 911.

17:52.710 --> 17:55.170
凯莉  我叫莎拉 我是医生
Kelli, my name is Sara.I'm a doctor.

17:55.180 --> 17:57.240
你会没事的  听得到我说话吗?
You're gonna be okay. Can you hear me?

17:57.250 --> 17:58.370
你会没事的
You'll be all right.

17:58.380 --> 18:02.310
深呼吸  然后...
Take some deep breaths and...

18:03.350 --> 18:04.700
凯莉?
Kelli?

18:04.710 --> 18:07.980
凯莉
Kelli.

18:14.750 --> 18:17.340
会没事的  是吧?
It's gonna be okay, right?

18:17.350 --> 18:20.970
我是说既然你能把我们八个人从监狱里弄出来
I mean, if you can get eight people out of prison,

18:20.980 --> 18:25.410
当然也可以把我从这里弄出来 是吧?
you can get my puerto rican ass out of this, right?

18:25.480 --> 18:28.550
可以吧?
Can't you?

18:36.110 --> 18:39.500
加把劲!
Come on!

18:39.510 --> 18:42.810
该死的!
Damn it!

18:52.780 --> 18:54.900
听到了吗?
Do you hear that?

18:54.910 --> 18:58.140
我知道那个声音
I know that sound.

18:58.150 --> 19:02.250
河的上游有个坝
There's a dam up river.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.640
这是个信号
It's a signal.

19:03.650 --> 19:06.670
意味着他们开闸了
It means they're opening the locks.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.500
这就意味着水面要上涨了
That means the water level's gonna rise

19:08.510 --> 19:09.500
水面上升后
and when it does

19:09.510 --> 19:11.040
这根木头就会漂走的
the log will just float right off.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.740
真的?
Yeah?

19:12.750 --> 19:14.440
警犬部队闻到了几种气味
Canine units at the scene have multiple scents

19:14.450 --> 19:16.100
现正分头到田里搜索
and are spreading out into the field.

19:16.110 --> 19:17.440
痕迹是刚留下的
Trail's fresh.

19:17.450 --> 19:21.940
这几个家伙跑不远
These guys can't have gotten very far.

19:21.950 --> 19:24.200
后面有6个人在搜那屋子
There were six cons back at that house.

19:24.210 --> 19:26.340
他们会从各个方向来追捕我们
They'll be tracking us in every direction.

19:26.350 --> 19:28.700
搜到这里得花上一个小时
It'll take an hour just to make it over this far

19:28.710 --> 19:32.170
到那个时候  水面上涨  我们也早跑了
and by that time, the water level will rise, we'll be long gone.

19:32.180 --> 19:35.170
你确定?
Are you sure?

19:35.180 --> 19:38.170
是的  我肯定
Yeah, I'm sure.

19:38.180 --> 19:41.540
我确定
I'm sure.

19:41.550 --> 19:45.170
去问问当时在场的20个警察中的任何一个 约翰  阿布鲁奇是带着武器的
Ask any of the 20 cops there, John Abruzzi was armed.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.300
约翰 阿布鲁奇拿出了武器
John Abruzzi drew his weapon...

19:46.310 --> 19:48.270
根本不该允许他走那么远
he never should have been allowed to get that far.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.440
理查德  让我们说清楚
Richard, let's be clear.

19:49.450 --> 19:51.300
如果你知道追捕逃犯应该怎样掌控局势
If you knew how things needed to be handled in a manhunt,

19:51.310 --> 19:53.340
你就会让他逃跑
you'd be out there running one

19:53.350 --> 19:56.840
而不是把他打瘸
instead of hamstringing the men that are.

19:56.850 --> 19:59.970
FBI调查这起越狱事件的主要目标是
The FBI's primary objective in investigating fugitive matters

19:59.980 --> 20:02.340
掌握他们的逃逸地点
is to affect the swift location

20:02.350 --> 20:03.670
并抓住这些逃犯
and capture of the fugitives.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.840
你已经杀了两个人了  亚历克斯
You have two dead bodies, Alex.

20:04.850 --> 20:07.540
理查德 我只是杀了两个重刑犯
I've got two dead felons, Richard.

20:07.550 --> 20:09.040
现在也许从公众关系的角度来说
Now, maybe that doesn't play well

20:09.050 --> 20:10.940
这件事做得并不好
from a public relations standpoint,

20:10.950 --> 20:12.500
但从公众安全这个角度上
but from a public safety standpoint

20:12.510 --> 20:14.800
阿布鲁奇和阿克斯按常理是应该被杀的
Abruzzi and Apolskis were by the book.

20:14.810 --> 20:17.770
近距离的向一个手无寸铁的小孩子射击
Shooting of an unarmed kid at point-blank range

20:17.780 --> 20:19.000
也是符合常理的吗？
is by the book?

20:19.010 --> 20:21.800
别狡辩了
Come on.

20:21.810 --> 20:23.070
报告上说
Incident report

20:23.080 --> 20:24.940
大卫 阿克斯
David "Tweener" Apolskis.

20:24.950 --> 20:27.970
你知道  我很好奇 他在押送途中带手铐了吗？
You know, I'm curious, was he cuffed during transport?

20:27.980 --> 20:29.040
是的
Yeah

20:29.050 --> 20:30.270
这么说是他不知怎么
Says in here he somehow

20:30.280 --> 20:32.670
成功地抢了你的枪
managed to grab your primary weapon.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.940
-你的枪放在肩膀上的还是臀部上的枪套里? -臀部的
- You carry that in a shoulder holster? - Hip.

20:34.950 --> 20:36.270
左边  右边?右边  左边?
Left, right? Right, left?

20:36.280 --> 20:37.740
左边
Left.

20:37.750 --> 20:38.670
左边
Left.

20:40.680 --> 20:44.540
对不起  我时常会搞混
I'm sorry, I get confused sometimes.

20:44.550 --> 20:46.500
所以我可以这样推断
So just so I've got this right

20:46.510 --> 20:50.270
你当时单独押着一个带着手铐的犯人开车
you were driving along alone with a cuffed prisoner,

20:50.280 --> 20:53.140
然后不知怎的他袭向你的胸部
and somehow he reaches forward across your chest

20:53.150 --> 20:56.550
抢了你的枪
and grabs your weapon.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.000
很遗憾你和阿克斯在一起时
It's too bad you didn't react that quickly

20:58.010 --> 20:59.600
反应还没有现在这么快
with Apolskis.

20:59.610 --> 21:04.050
也许他还能活着
Maybe he'd still be alive.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.070
有个计划可以解决所有问题
there's a plan to make all of this right

21:45.080 --> 21:46.900
一只纸鹤能和这个有什么关系?
What does an origami bird have to do with any of this?

21:47.610 --> 21:50.170
那是迈克尔·斯科菲尔德寄给她的
Michael Scofield sent it to her.

21:50.180 --> 21:51.840
既然你为了平息事情
And since your brilliant plan

21:51.850 --> 21:54.070
而打算把莎拉  唐克雷蒂除掉的杰出计划
to eliminate Sara Tancredi from the equation

21:54.080 --> 21:56.040
-已经彻底失败了 -我不会说是彻底失败
-failed so completely -I wouldn't say it failed completely at all.

21:56.050 --> 22:00.970
在电话亭里死了一个女人
There's a dead woman in a phone booth.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.200
一个无辜百姓
Civilian.

22:02.210 --> 22:05.570
你可以把一部分人的死归结于某人名下
A certain number of bodies you can sweep under the rug.

22:05.580 --> 22:08.570
不过以总统的名义已经行不通了
President's rug is getting so full, you can hardly stand on it.

22:08.580 --> 22:12.040
那你觉得我们该怎么做?
So what do you suggest we should do?

22:12.050 --> 22:15.040
你钓过鱼吗  比尔?
You ever go fishing, Bill?

22:15.050 --> 22:16.200
请说重点
Just make your point.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.640
捕鱼有两种方法
There's two ways to catch a fish.

22:17.650 --> 22:18.840
撒一张大网
You cast out a big

22:18.850 --> 22:21.440
然后祈祷能得到你所想要的东西
net and hope you get what you're looking for.

22:21.450 --> 22:25.670
要不你就得挑选合适的诱饵 并确保行之无误
Or you choose the right bait and guarantee that you do.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.070
方法就是这么简单 世间万事也都如此这般
It's a simple strategy, plays across the board.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.470
LJ会带我们找到布伦斯
LJ will lead us to Burrows.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.370
莎拉会把我们引向斯科菲尔德
Sara will lead us to Scofield.

22:31.380 --> 22:33.640
那你打算怎么跟踪莎拉?
And how do you intend to follow Sara,

22:33.650 --> 22:35.300
她带给你的只有一直纸鹤
when the only lead you've got is an origami bird

22:35.310 --> 22:37.440
和一个停机的电话号码
with an out of service phone number?

22:37.450 --> 22:43.280
也许那根本不是电话号码
Maybe it's not a phone number.

22:56.050 --> 22:57.700
你发现什么了?
What do you have?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.440
那小鬼出来了  不过仍没有布伦斯的踪影
Junior's on the move, but still no sign of Burrows.

23:00.450 --> 23:01.740
先生  那家伙藏匿起来了
Sir, the guy's in hiding

23:01.750 --> 23:03.600
或许他还不知道儿子出来了
maybe he doesn't even know his kid's out.

23:03.610 --> 23:07.000
犹他州那个被挟持的女警察已证实
The cop that was held hostage in Utah

23:07.010 --> 23:09.020
在布伦斯得知LJ被释放后
has Burrows splitting off from the rest of the group

23:09.030 --> 23:10.800
他就脱离他们那一伙了
just after word of LJ's release hit the wire.

23:10.810 --> 23:12.440
他一定知道的
He knows.

23:12.450 --> 23:14.770
现在如果想知道他到底在不在这儿
Now if we want to know for sure if he's there

23:14.780 --> 23:19.910
我们得采取点行动把他引出来
we need to do something to draw him out.

23:33.310 --> 23:36.370
给点零钱花花
Hey, you mind sparing some change?

23:36.380 --> 23:38.000
没有
No.

23:38.010 --> 23:39.300
给点吧
Come on.

23:39.310 --> 23:40.600
没有  我身无分文
No, I'm all tapped out.

23:40.610 --> 23:41.770
你一定有点什么
You got something.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.770
我要拿走你身上的一切
I'll take whatever you got.

23:43.780 --> 23:49.080
老实说  我刚被放出来 要是我有的话一定会给你
Look, seriously, I just got out of lock-up.

23:50.950 --> 23:52.000
抱歉
Sorry.

23:52.010 --> 23:54.070
我知道了  你觉得你比我强  是吧?
I see, you think you're better than me, huh?

23:54.080 --> 23:56.440
我没觉得比你强
I don't think I'm better than you.

23:56.450 --> 23:58.900
小子 你要往哪儿跑?
Yo, where you running, little man?

23:58.910 --> 24:02.550
我哪也不去
I'm not running anywhere.

24:11.710 --> 24:14.940
本不该这样的
This isn't how it's supposed to go.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.840
我越狱只有一个理由
The whole reason I went along with the break

24:16.850 --> 24:20.970
就是想和玛丽克鲁兹还有我的孩子共度此生
was to have a life with Maricruz and my baby.

24:20.980 --> 24:21.940
而现在呢？
And now what?

24:21.950 --> 24:24.240
找份普通工作
Get some two-bit job?

24:24.250 --> 24:28.600
心平气和的看待一切?
Always be looking over my shoulder?

24:28.610 --> 24:31.670
那种生活怎样?
What kind of life is that?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.570
你可以和我还有林肯一起
You can come with me and Linc.

24:33.580 --> 24:34.800
到巴拿马去
To Panama.

24:34.810 --> 24:35.970
从头开始
Start over.

24:35.980 --> 24:37.340
你待在这越久
The longer you stay here

24:37.350 --> 24:39.640
就越没机会去巴拿马
the more chance there is you'll never make it to Panama.

24:39.650 --> 24:42.240
你还有其他要牵挂的人
You've got other people to think about.

24:42.250 --> 24:44.300
你哥哥  你外甥
Your brother, your nephew.

24:44.310 --> 24:46.470
还有莎拉
Sara.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.570
她会在巴拿马等你  对吧?
She's meeting you down there, isn't she?

24:48.580 --> 24:50.100
我不知道
I don't know.

24:50.110 --> 24:52.040
我们从没谈过此事
We never talked about it.

24:52.050 --> 24:53.180
但你希望如此
But you're hoping.

24:53.190 --> 24:54.440
这个等会再说  行吗
Just give it a rest, will you.

24:54.450 --> 24:56.500
警犬们已经锁定住目标 我们还发现两条痕印合并一块了
The dogs are locked in. We've got two trails merging.

24:56.510 --> 24:57.870
他们一定在这儿
They were definitely here.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.100
他们往东边的爵克农场去了
They've headed east towards drucker ranch.

24:59.110 --> 25:01.100
他们离开大路了  还需要人手
They've gone off-road.Any additional units

25:01.110 --> 25:02.970
我们得形成一个一英里的包围圈
we need to setup a one-mile perimeter

25:02.980 --> 25:03.970
然后开始缩小范围
and then start closing in.

25:03.980 --> 25:08.380
水越来越深了
It's getting deeper.

25:10.310 --> 25:14.810
这个烦人的玩意怎么还是一动不动的?
So how come this freaking thing ain't moving yet?

25:15.810 --> 25:19.110
我来看看
Let me check

25:26.280 --> 25:29.900
你还好吗？
You all right?

25:29.910 --> 25:31.700
听着  迈克尔
Hey, Michael...

25:31.710 --> 25:33.440
我明白如果你要继续走的话...
I understand if you have to keep going, you know.

25:33.450 --> 25:35.000
别说那个
Don't say that.

25:35.010 --> 25:36.170
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

25:36.180 --> 25:37.740
不  还是想想吧
No, but, look, just think about it.

25:37.750 --> 25:39.000
我不会让你就这么淹死
You know, if I leave you drown.

25:39.010 --> 25:40.440
不  我知道  但是
No, I know, but just...

25:40.450 --> 25:42.400
水面正在升高  苏克雷
the water level's getting higher, Sucre.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.170
你能屏住呼吸多少秒?
How many seconds can you hold your breath?

25:44.180 --> 25:45.600
45秒? 60秒?
45? 60?

25:45.610 --> 25:48.070
如果我走了你就只能活那么久
That's how long you've got to live if I take off.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.740
你呆在这又能有多久呢？
How long do you have if you stay?

25:49.750 --> 25:51.300
在狗把警察带到这里以前还有多久?
How long till the dogs lead the cops here?

25:51.310 --> 25:53.400
你提的建议都不可取
What you're suggesting is not an option.

25:53.410 --> 25:55.440
听着  我并不想做个英雄或是什么
Look, I ain't trying to be a hero or nothing.

25:55.450 --> 25:59.770
我们都知道现在只有两种情况会发生
We both know there are only two things that can happen now.

25:59.780 --> 26:02.740
把我留在这儿
Leave me here...

26:02.750 --> 26:06.450
或者两个都被捕
or we both get caught.

26:24.950 --> 26:25.940
布鲁斯
Bruce.

26:25.950 --> 26:27.000
莎拉
Oh, Sara.

26:27.010 --> 26:28.370
我知道我们说好不用这个号码
I know we said not to use this number

26:28.380 --> 26:30.140
但我想知道你是否安全
but I just needed to know you were okay.

26:30.150 --> 26:31.840
我司机说他去接你
My driver said he went to pick you up

26:31.850 --> 26:33.170
但那里是犯罪现场
and the place was a crime scene.

26:33.180 --> 26:35.240
是的  他看到的那个女人 在电话亭边的那个
Yeah, the woman that he saw, the woman by the pay phone

26:35.250 --> 26:36.840
本来应该是我
that was supposed to be me.

26:36.850 --> 26:38.500
我  我只能把她留在那儿
And-and I had to leave her there.

26:38.510 --> 26:39.740
我不知道该怎么办
I didn't know what to do.

26:39.750 --> 26:40.800
布鲁斯  那些是什么人?
Bruce, who are these people?

26:40.810 --> 26:42.800
他们清楚的知道我的方位
They knew exactly where I was going to be standing.

26:42.810 --> 26:45.770
还知道我要去哪儿...
They knew where I was going to be...

26:45.780 --> 26:46.840
莎拉
Sara?

26:46.850 --> 26:48.700
是你
It was you.

26:48.710 --> 26:50.640
你在说什么  莎拉?
What are you talking about, Sara?

26:50.650 --> 26:52.300
我只是想知道你在哪儿
I just need to know where you are.

26:52.310 --> 26:55.410
天啊
Oh, my god.

27:22.010 --> 27:23.300
打扰一下
Excuse me

27:23.480 --> 27:25.970
我想看看我们的朋友 LJ  布伦斯怎么样了
we'd like to check on a friend of ours, LJ Burrows?

27:25.980 --> 27:27.070
他正在缝合伤口
He's getting some stitches.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.340
我们只是想确定他安然无恙
We just want to make sure he's all right.

27:29.350 --> 27:31.070
那他出来的时候你会看见的
And you can see him when he's through.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.270
这是规定
It's policy.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.270
你没搞清楚
You don't get it.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.600
我很清楚  那个孩子是在自卫
I get that that kid defended himself.

27:34.610 --> 27:36.740
你打算告诉我们为什么先袭击他吗?
You going to tell us why you attacked him in the first place?

27:36.750 --> 27:37.900
-我已经告诉你了 -我知道  有人收买你做的
-I told you man. -I know, some guy paid you.

27:37.910 --> 27:40.070
-有人付钱让我去做的 -打扰一下  FBI
-Some guy paid me to do it. -Excuse me. Fbi.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.140
你说有人付钱让你这么做
What do you mean

27:41.150 --> 27:42.140
此话怎讲？
somebody paid you?

27:42.150 --> 27:43.840
见鬼  你觉得听起来会是什么意思?
What the hell does it sound like, man?

27:43.850 --> 27:45.370
有个家伙给了我50美元
Some dude gave me 50 bucks

27:45.380 --> 27:48.340
叫我揍那小子一顿
to give the kid a beat down.

27:48.350 --> 27:51.950
是布伦斯  他在这儿
It's Burrows. He's here.

27:56.780 --> 27:58.300
儿子  你感觉如何?
How you feeling, son?

27:58.310 --> 28:01.170
爸爸
Dad?

28:01.180 --> 28:05.550
我们得离开这
We got to move.

28:21.210 --> 28:25.950
你知道的  你能做的不多
Well, there's not much you can do, you know.

28:26.050 --> 28:26.970
打扰一下  女士们
Excuse me, ladies.

28:26.980 --> 28:28.540
我有几个问题想问你
I need to ask you a few questions.

28:28.550 --> 28:30.400
我是跟进调查组的
I'm on the, uh, follow-up investigation team.

28:30.410 --> 28:33.710
麻烦一下
Excuse me.

28:34.010 --> 28:35.670
我们只是想知道
Uh, we're just curious.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.970
你是否看到那些罪犯找到了
Did you see if the convicts actually found

28:39.980 --> 28:41.600
他们挖洞想找的东西？
what they were digging for?

28:41.610 --> 28:43.140
没有  不过听上去好像找到了
No.But sure sounded like they did.

28:43.150 --> 28:44.400
那个西班牙人
The spaniard

28:44.410 --> 28:47.340
他非常兴奋的拿走了我女儿的一个露营背包
he took off with one of my daughter's camping packs

28:47.350 --> 28:49.070
然后扔下其他人走了
and he left the other ones in a real tizzy.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.440
听上去他用暴力手段背弃了他人
Sounded like he screwed 'em over something fierce.

28:51.450 --> 28:52.770
然后他们就那么让他走了？
And-and they just let him leave?

28:52.780 --> 28:55.740
他们是很不乐意  不过也没有办法
Well, they weren't happy about it, but, yeah.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.470
他开着摩托离开了
He took off on his motorbike

28:57.480 --> 28:59.070
几分钟后其他人也离开了
and then they left a few minutes later.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.370
-一起走的? -不是
-Together? -No.

29:00.380 --> 29:03.070
那个帅小伙和那个黑人先离开
The pretty one and the black fellow, they left first

29:03.080 --> 29:04.440
再是那个邋遢的南方人
and then that dirty southerner...

29:04.450 --> 29:05.570
他鬼鬼祟祟的从后门走的
he snuck out the back.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.170
不过他行动有点缓慢
But he was moving kind of slow, you know

29:07.180 --> 29:08.470
一来那个背包很重
the weight of that backpack

29:08.480 --> 29:10.440
二来他本身还有伤残
and that disability that...

29:10.450 --> 29:12.040
等等  他也有个背包?
wait a minute, he had a backpack, too?

29:12.050 --> 29:13.200
是的
Yes.

29:13.210 --> 29:16.100
他又倒回来  在出去的时候
He came back in and slipped this into my brassiere

29:16.110 --> 29:18.140
把这个塞进我胸衣里
on his way out.

29:18.150 --> 29:23.150
他说用这个来弥补我们的损失
He said it was to cover the damages.

29:24.680 --> 29:28.370
我们要保留这个作为证据
Um, we're going to need to keep this as evidence.

29:28.380 --> 29:30.230
谢谢合作
Thank you for your time.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.740
上车
get the car

29:39.240 --> 29:42.540

Three, three, nine, space.

29:45.050 --> 29:48.900
8 6 8 7
Eight, six, eight, seven.

29:48.910 --> 29:50.770
你到底想查什么?
And what exactly are you looking for?

29:50.780 --> 29:53.000
图形  代码
A pattern.A code.

29:53.010 --> 29:56.310
任何东西
Anything.

30:22.780 --> 30:28.100
是什么迈克尔? 你到底想要告诉我什么?
What? What are you trying to tell me, Michael?

30:28.110 --> 30:29.770
听说...
They say...

30:29.780 --> 30:33.100
一个人闯入你的生活总会有个理由
people come into your life for a reason.

30:33.110 --> 30:38.270
也许我的理由就是帮你离开福克斯河监狱
Maybe my reason was to help you get out of Fox River.

30:38.280 --> 30:41.740
帮你救出你哥哥
You know, to help you save your brother.

30:41.750 --> 30:45.310
不是的
No.

30:50.750 --> 30:53.770
没关系  兄弟
It's okay, papi.

30:53.780 --> 30:56.070
不用管我
Let me go.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.270
我们现在距离水坝下的小河1/4英里
We're a quarter mile up the river

30:58.280 --> 31:01.380
他们就在附近
below the dam.

31:02.010 --> 31:05.580
现在不走就来不及了  迈克尔
It's now or never, Michael.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.470
我要你摒住呼吸
I want you to hold your breath.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.640
-好不好? -为什么?
-Okay? -Why?

31:11.650 --> 31:12.670
照做就是了
Just do it.

31:12.680 --> 31:16.050
我保证马上就回来
I'll be right back, I promise.

31:33.510 --> 31:35.940
你在搞什么鬼?
What the hell are you doing?

31:35.950 --> 31:38.600
所有单位改道小河
all units to the river.

31:38.610 --> 31:40.100
我要你潜下去
I want you to go under.

31:40.110 --> 31:42.840
把手伸出水面  举高
And then stick your arm up, above the water, high.

31:42.850 --> 31:43.900
好
All right.

31:43.910 --> 31:46.540
如果你憋不住了
And then when you start running out of air

31:46.550 --> 31:47.770
就前后挥动你的手
wave it back and forth

31:47.780 --> 31:49.170
-这样我就能看到 -好
-so I can see it.

31:49.180 --> 31:50.370
我就会过来救你
And I'll come back and get you.Okay?

31:50.380 --> 31:53.950
明白了? 把你的手给我
All right, give me your hand.

31:54.110 --> 31:55.700
1...
One...

31:55.710 --> 31:56.870
2...
two...

32:33.810 --> 32:38.350
快点  快点
Come on.Come on!

33:17.250 --> 33:18.750
苏克雷
Sucre!

33:24.450 --> 33:25.110
苏克雷
Sucre!

34:00.680 --> 34:01.640
说吧
talk to me.

34:01.650 --> 34:02.770
是这样
Well

34:02.780 --> 34:04.400
有一个可能
there is one possibility

34:04.410 --> 34:06.040
不过可能太简单了
but it's almost too rudimentary.

34:06.050 --> 34:08.300
在看手机键盘的时候
We know we're not looking at a phone number

34:08.310 --> 34:12.810
我们可能根本不会看它的数字
but maybe we're not looking at numbers at all.

34:14.510 --> 34:16.040
而是看每个数字上面
What's important are the letters

34:16.050 --> 34:21.070
对应的字母
that correspond to that number.

34:21.080 --> 34:24.400
3个点  第3个字母
Three dots, third letter

34:24.410 --> 34:25.700
R
"R."

34:25.710 --> 34:29.970
2个点...D...E
Two-- "D," "E."

34:29.980 --> 34:31.640
每个数字有3种可能
Three possibilities per number.

34:31.650 --> 34:36.370
那就有成千上万种可能
That's thousands of letter combinations.

34:36.380 --> 34:41.040
但是只有一种组合是对的
But only one of them's going to be right.

34:41.050 --> 34:45.050
(rendezvous:约会地点)
rendezvous pendextoup

34:46.880 --> 34:51.650
问题是地点在哪儿
Question is where.

35:01.110 --> 35:02.340
你好
Hey.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.200
你需要点什么?
What are you in the market for?

35:04.210 --> 35:05.470
只要能开的车就行
Four wheels and a gas pedal.

35:05.480 --> 35:09.600
嗨  皮特 是我
Hey, petey. Uh, it's me.

35:09.610 --> 35:11.100
听着  我有点...
Uh, listen

35:11.110 --> 35:12.240
事情要告诉你
I-I got something to tell you.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.100
好的  我还在想你什么时候会打电话给我
Yeah, well, I was wondering when you were gonna call.

35:14.110 --> 35:19.300
是的  上次见了你之后发生了很多事情...
Yeah, um, a-a lot has come down since we last talked, and, uh...

35:19.310 --> 35:21.340
我知道  我听说了
Gee, I know, I heard.

35:21.350 --> 35:22.770
你把它毁了
You ruined it.

35:22.780 --> 35:25.340
是的  嗯...
Yeah.

35:25.350 --> 35:26.400

37:04.350 --> 37:09.250

37:16.450 --> 37:18.000
只有一种办法才能弄清楚
Only one way to find out.

如果你是帝博格  你手上有5百万美元
If you were Bagwell, and you just got your hands on $5 million

37:20.380 --> 37:25.310
你会去哪里?

38:27.150 --> 38:29.470

清除所有痕迹  要像她从没回过家一样

在等你从犹他飞回来的间隙里
You know, waiting for your flight from Utah

40:00.050 --> 40:02.340
我稍微有了点空闲
I had a little extra time for due diligence,

40:02.350 --> 40:04.970
于是我决定研究一下的你的过去
so I decided to dig a little deeper on your history

40:04.980 --> 40:06.000
要不然还真不知道
or rather lack of one.

40:06.010 --> 40:07.870
开始很简单  家境贫穷
Starts off simple enough.Poor family.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.770

40:09.780 --> 40:11.800

40:11.810 --> 40:13.740
这些儿科医疗记录表明
by the look of these pediatric meds

40:13.750 --> 40:16.570
随后四年他像打格陵兰海豹一样地打你

很大的打击  穷困  虐待儿童   别无选择
Big shock-- poor, abused kid, not a lot of options

40:19.110 --> 40:21.570
他参军了
he joins the military.

40:21.580 --> 40:24.100
有什么想问就开门见山吧 别在那喋喋不休
Will there be any actual questions, or is this just a show-and-tell?

40:24.110 --> 40:25.300
好  我有个问题
Okay, I got one.

40:25.310 --> 40:27.370
为什么一个普通的步兵
How does a guy go from infantry grunt

40:27.380 --> 40:31.200
作为特别观察员在第一次海湾战争表现平平
with less than stellar marks to the gulf 1, special ops,

40:31.210 --> 40:32.900
却能加入联邦调查局
to the federal bureau of investigations

40:32.910 --> 40:37.270
而且正领导着这个国家 有史以来最大的追捕行动?
leading the largest manhunt this country's ever seen?

40:37.280 --> 40:38.500
我有这些零星线索
I have all these dots.

40:38.510 --> 40:41.170
但是我却不能连系在一起
And there's just no way to connect them.

40:41.180 --> 40:44.640
你应该查你职权范围内的事情... 迪克
Looks like you need to work on your clearance level...Dick.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.200

-你想这么做? -我要把你锁在这张桌子上
-You want to do this? -I will chain you to this desk

40:48.680 --> 40:50.940
直到我发现我的猜测是错误的
until I get some answers I cannot fertilize my lawn with.

40:50.950 --> 40:52.900
你确定你真的要这么做?
You sure you want to do this?

40:52.910 --> 40:55.200
我知道他们让你在国外做了什么  亚历克斯
I know what they tell you to do overseas, Alex,

40:55.210 --> 40:57.370
让我把话再说得更清楚点
and let me make it perfectly clear

40:57.380 --> 40:59.700
在美国国土上我们不能那样做
we do not do it on American soil.

40:59.710 --> 41:02.600
长官  有电话找你
Sir, uh, there's a phone call for you.

41:02.610 --> 41:04.000
我等一下再接
I'll take it later.

41:04.010 --> 41:08.550
长官  你最好现在就接
Uh, sir, you're gonna want to take this now.

41:11.850 --> 41:14.600
喂

41:14.610 --> 41:16.470

41:18.110 --> 41:20.270
我现在就和他在一起
I'm with him now.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.070
是 长官
Yes, sir.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.210
好
Okay.

41:29.010 --> 41:30.540
你去哪儿?
Where you going, Rick?

41:30.550 --> 41:34.240
我想我们应该进入正题了
I thought we were really starting to get somewhere.

41:34.250 --> 41:38.410
我们走
Let's go.

41:51.550 --> 41:53.700
亚历克斯
Alex.

41:53.710 --> 41:58.750
你有什么给我?
You got something for me?

42:01.010 --> 42:03.940
打开它

42:03.950 --> 42:06.470
这些数字联系到
The numbers correlate

42:06.480 --> 42:08.340
手机上的字母
to the letters on a phone.

42:08.350 --> 42:09.800
只有这个可能
Only on this one

42:09.810 --> 42:12.500
其他组合都说不通
none of the possible combinations make sense.

42:12.510 --> 42:13.640
我们认为这数字对应的是个地点
We think it's a location

42:13.650 --> 42:14.870
迈克尔 斯科菲尔德约定的见面地点
a rendezvous point for Michael Scofield.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.000
找到了地点
You find it

42:16.010 --> 42:17.770
就找到了他
you find him.

42:17.780 --> 42:19.700
你该快些把我从那里弄出去
You know, you could have gotten me out of there sooner.

42:19.710 --> 42:22.370
我们需要通过些渠道
You know, even we have to go through certain channels

42:22.380 --> 42:25.300
才能把事情做得看起来可信
to make things appear on the up-and-up.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.970
亚历克斯你明白这些  不是吗?
You know all about that, don't you, Alex?

42:27.980 --> 42:32.450
保持原样吧
Keeping up appearances.

42:32.650 --> 42:34.000
很好
Good.

42:34.010 --> 42:36.800
我只是想确认一下
I was just making sure

42:36.810 --> 42:40.300
你是否还记得这次追捕的目标
that we're still clear on the directive of this manhunt.

42:40.310 --> 42:43.540
我知道...追捕布伦斯和斯科菲尔德的原因
You know, I understand the, uh, reasoning behind Burrows and Scofield,

42:43.550 --> 42:45.740
但是其他人...虽然他们可能是罪犯
but these other men-- criminals that they may be--

42:45.750 --> 42:48.370
但是没有证据表明...
there's nothing in their profiles to suggest...

42:48.380 --> 42:50.800
你只是被雇佣做事的
you've been hired to do a job.

42:50.810 --> 42:54.100
理由不关你的事
The reasoning does not concern you.

42:54.110 --> 42:56.140
不要问关于我们的问题
Don't ask any questions about us

42:56.150 --> 42:58.270
这样或许我们能继续保证不再有人调查你
and maybe we'll continue to make sure no one asks any questions about you.

42:58.280 --> 43:01.410
明白了吗?
Are we clear?

43:04.310 --> 43:08.180
全部都得死
They all die.
