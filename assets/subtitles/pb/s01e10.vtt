00:08.590 --> 00:10.010
然后挖一个通道
and dig ourselves an on-ramp.

00:10.020 --> 00:13.720
我一定会找出 你在那里干了什么
I'm gonna find out, you know,what it is you're doing up there.

如果要讨论谁有杀特伦斯的动机 我们需要一天的时间

00:17.550 --> 00:19.540
-这和公司有什么关系  -算算看
-Anything to do with EcoField?  -Do the math.

00:19.540 --> 00:23.150
一个公司的CEO因为诈骗而辞职 投资者开始损失

-月初到了 约翰  -是的 怎么了

00:39.590 --> 00:42.840
看看我银行的帐户 看起来好象不足啊
I checked my balance on line. It's looking deficient.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.570
明显的 菲波纳奇又出现了
Apparently Fibonacci's coming up for air again.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.850
如果他在听证会上做证
If he testifies at that hearing

00:47.860 --> 00:51.410
很多人都要遭殃 包括我
a lot of people are going down,including me.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.490
听着 这个 呃
Listen. There, uh...

00:53.500 --> 00:55.090
这里要权力变换
there's been a restructuring.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.880
这是菲利决定的
This comes from Philly himself.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.910
所以我现在是这里的管理了
So I'm the man in here now.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.810
你他妈的在干什么
What the hell are you doin'? Aargh!

01:03.820 --> 01:06.770

我们一起做事很久了 我们可以解决的对吧
We've been doing business too long. We can fix this thing,right?

02:29.240 --> 02:30.920
让我说明白
Let's get something clear.

02:30.930 --> 02:34.120
我们之间用不着胡扯 法尔曾是给我钱的人
You and I haven't done crap. Falzone's the one payin' me.

02:34.130 --> 02:35.590
法尔曾就是一个信封
He's just an envelope.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.950
你和我面对面的做这生意
You've been doing business with me face to face.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.410
你想我被别人撒尿
You think I like getting piss thrown at me?

02:40.420 --> 02:41.640
还是吐口水
Spit on?

02:41.650 --> 02:45.670
这里别的笨蛋也许会为了 4万一年和那件小蓝制服这么做
Other chumps might do it for 40 grand a year and the little uniform,

02:45.680 --> 02:47.530
但是我不会
but I'm not that dumb.

02:47.540 --> 02:51.960
法尔曾的那信是我每天在 这的唯一原因
Falzone's envelope is the only reason I come through that fence every day.

02:51.970 --> 02:56.240
也是我坚持每天在这里的唯一原因
And it's the only reason I'm gonna keep coming through that fence

02:56.250 --> 02:59.550
直到我有足够的钱买下 湖边的房子
until I have enough money to buy a house on Lake Gray.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.820
我想早点退休 约翰
I'm thinking early retirement, John.

03:01.820 --> 03:03.180
可是你却在阻止我
And you're interfering with that.

03:03.190 --> 03:05.980
嘿 老大 给我点时间 
Hey, boss. Just give me some time

03:05.990 --> 03:08.540
我可以给你法尔曾给你的 任何东西
and I can match whatever Falzone's paying you.

03:08.550 --> 03:10.210
你出局了
You're out of business.

03:10.220 --> 03:11.790
学着适应吧
Get used to it.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.040
嘿 老大
Hey, boss.

03:13.050 --> 03:16.880
老大
Boss!

03:35.370 --> 03:37.420
他们就要找到它了
They're gonna find it.

03:37.430 --> 03:38.790
只要他们在里面越长的时间
The longer they're in there,

03:38.800 --> 03:40.540
他们就会越快的发现
the sooner they're gonna find it.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.970
那我们就要回到那
Then we gotta get back in there.

03:42.980 --> 03:45.360
我现在要告诉你一些疯狂的事
I'm gonna say something crazy to you now.

03:45.370 --> 03:47.080
真是惊讶啊
Surprise, surprise.

03:47.090 --> 03:49.990
我再也不管菲波纳奇了
I don't give a damn about that Fibonacci.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.920
的确 这的确很疯狂
You're right. That is crazy.

03:51.930 --> 03:55.750
因为我有更重要的事情要考虑 比如说活下去
Because I got bigger things to think about,like survival.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.120
你知道 我在这里的朋友变少了
You see, I'm kinda short on friends in here,

03:58.130 --> 04:02.290
除非你没有注意
in case you haven't noticed.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.200
我要离开这里 现在
I need to get out, right now.

04:05.210 --> 04:06.840
我还有我的生活
While I've still got my life.

04:06.850 --> 04:09.360
那我们为什么说菲波纳奇
Then why are we talking about Fibonacci?

04:09.370 --> 04:11.540
是这样 我弄回那间房子的 唯一办法
The only way I can get that room back

04:11.550 --> 04:15.310
就是向 法尔曾证明我还有用
is if I can prove to Falzone I'm still worthy,that I've still got what it takes. Yeah?

04:15.320 --> 04:21.290
那就是给他菲波纳奇 这样我们可以继续做我们的事情
And the only way I can do that is if I can give him Fibonacci.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.330
有意思
Interesting.

04:23.340 --> 04:27.380
你看 这不再是"你我对决"
You see, this is not a me-versus-you thing any more.

04:27.390 --> 04:30.330
这是"我们"的事 对吧
This is us. An us thing, all right?

04:30.340 --> 04:33.410
-是我们要逃出去  -是吗
-It's us for the escape.  -Is it?

04:33.420 --> 04:36.340
或者是关于你回去和那些暴民一起的好处
Or is this about you getting back in good with the Mob again?

04:36.350 --> 04:38.570
那种不再是我的生活了 嫩鸡
That life is over for me, fish.

04:38.580 --> 04:41.030
我的意思是 他们折断了我的翅膀
I mean, they clipped my wings.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.360
他们要我在这里腐烂
They want me to rot in here,

04:43.370 --> 04:45.520
我和他们再也不是 联盟了
so I got no allegiance to them any more.

04:45.530 --> 04:49.980
而你却还想帮他们
And yet you still want to do them a favour.

04:50.940 --> 04:53.480
法尔曾绝望了
Falzone is desperate.

04:53.490 --> 04:57.330
你看 如果菲波纳奇下个月 在法院作证
See, if Fibonacci testifies in front of the Congress next month,

04:57.340 --> 04:59.900
法尔曾就完蛋了
Falzone's gonna go down in flames.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.900
但是如果我们给他菲波纳奇
But if we give him Fibonacci,

05:01.910 --> 05:04.530
他会给我们任何东西
he will give us anything.

05:04.540 --> 05:09.920
任何东西 包括那一个特别房间
Anything. Including that very special room.

05:09.930 --> 05:14.310
你怎么想 嫩鸡
What do you say, fish?

05:16.820 --> 05:18.750
主对撒旦说
"And the Lord said unto Satan,

05:18.760 --> 05:21.620
你愿意服从于我吗
'Hast thou considered my servant Job?"'

05:21.620 --> 05:23.950
这世界上没有象他一样
"'That there is none like him in the earth.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.510
是完美正直的人
A perfect and an upright man."'

05:26.520 --> 05:30.490
一个敬畏上帝憎恶邪恶的人
"'One that fears God and shuns evil."'

05:30.500 --> 05:32.650
-放弃他  -如果我这样 他们会杀了他
-Give him up.  -If I did,they'll kill him.

05:32.660 --> 05:36.790
-也许这是他的报应  -就是这点 不是
-Maybe he deserves it.  -That's just it. He doesn't.

05:36.790 --> 05:39.280
这个人是谁 你告诉我他是个黑手党
Who is this guy? You told me he was Mafia.

05:39.280 --> 05:43.320
他为黑手党干 只是自己不知道
He was working for the Mafia.He just didn't know it.

05:43.330 --> 05:45.620
奥托·菲波纳奇 是...
Otto Fibonacci is...

05:45.630 --> 05:47.530
就象你一样
He's just like you.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.660
一个无辜的人
An innocent man,

05:49.670 --> 05:53.300
在错误的时间错误的地点被抓住
caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

05:53.310 --> 05:54.660
你在干什么
What are you doing?

05:54.670 --> 05:55.510
你知道的
You know

05:55.520 --> 05:58.300
我没有偷你的东西 约翰
I didn't steal from you, John.

05:58.310 --> 06:01.540
他是阿布鲁奇仓库的一个 中间管理者
He was management at one of Abruzzi's warehouses.

06:01.550 --> 06:03.200
只是一个普通的人
Just a normal guy

06:03.210 --> 06:04.920
工人阶级 教徒
working class, religious.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.120
我没有偷你的东西 约翰
I didn't steal from you, John.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.040
嘿 尼奇 尼奇 尼奇 尼奇
Hey, Nicky. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.

06:09.050 --> 06:11.700

06:11.710 --> 06:14.320
我是怎么告诉你说话要注意的
What did I tell you about talking?

06:14.330 --> 06:17.820
约翰 求你了
John, please.

06:19.280 --> 06:23.120
约翰 求你了 不
John, please. no

06:23.420 --> 06:26.950
那人不会面对谋杀而置之不理
Somebody that couldn't turn his back on murder.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.020
他发现阿布鲁奇和法尔曾 他一起工作的人
He realised that Abruzzi and Falzone,the men he worked for,

06:30.030 --> 06:31.520
是杀人凶手
were killers.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.420
他有他们所做一切的证据
He had the key to their dealings

06:33.430 --> 06:35.460
可以让他们蹲一辈子监狱的东西
that could put them away for life.

06:35.460 --> 06:38.700
现在他处于证人保护中
And now he's in witness protection for life.

06:38.710 --> 06:42.360
法官问他为什么要站出来
The judge asked why he was coming forward with this information.

06:42.370 --> 06:46.060
他说他认为这是正确的
He said it was because he thought it was the right thing to do.

现在什么是正确的迈克尔
What's the right thing to do now, Michael?

06:48.560 --> 06:50.610
我不知道
I don't know.

06:50.620 --> 06:53.140
但是如果我不放弃他
But if I don't give him up,

06:53.150 --> 06:57.280
整件事就完了
this whole thing's over.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.470
我们不知道

我们如果告诉他那小子跑了 你我 我们现在就不在这了

It means, if I'd have known how this was gonna turn out,

I've been in the kitchen for eight months.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.800
我擦过不只一个盘子
I scrub one more tray,

11:35.810 --> 11:38.060
我准备去J-cat 你知道我说的是什么么?
I'm gonna go j-cat. you know what I say?

11:38.060 --> 11:41.550
嘿 费列罗 怎么了?
Hey! Fiorello, how about it?

11:42.480 --> 11:46.070
150.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.260
那么算我一个
Sign me up, then, baby.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.990
我正在想你所说的
I was thinking about what you said

12:01.000 --> 12:03.460
这不是什么"你我对决"
that it's not a me-versus-you thing,

12:03.470 --> 12:06.490
这是"我们"的事
it's an us thing.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.810
对
That's right.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.810
这件事上你准备走多远
How far are you willing to go with that?

12:09.820 --> 12:11.510
我需要走多远就多远
As far as I have to.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.250
那么和法尔曾约一下
Then set up a meeting with Falzone.

12:14.260 --> 12:18.100
我想直接跟他谈谈
I wanna talk to him directly.

12:18.110 --> 12:21.290
法尔曾不直接跟你这种人谈
Falzone doesn't talk to guys like you directly.

12:21.300 --> 12:26.150
如果他想要菲波纳奇 他就会跟我谈的
If he wants Fibonacci, he's gonna have to.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.690
不 不
No, no.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.350
不 你听见我说的了
No, you heard me right

12:33.350 --> 12:35.500
你说这个孩子 会放弃菲波纳奇?
This kid is gonna give up Fibonacci?

12:35.510 --> 12:38.070
-你确定?  -当然 只是
-Sure?  -I'm definite. Only one thing,

12:38.080 --> 12:40.630
他想直接和你见面
he wants to meet with you directly.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.140
婊子养的 约翰 你做的对
Son of a bitch. You actually did something right. That's good.

12:44.150 --> 12:49.980
好吧 我想我应该给那些 要打断你腿的人一个电话了
Guess I'll have to call off those guys I hired to shank you.

12:49.990 --> 12:53.120
-开完笑的 约翰  -呵呵
-That was a joke, John.  -Funny.

12:53.130 --> 12:55.620
好吧 我下午会去那里
Good. I'll come out there this afternoon.

12:55.630 --> 12:56.650
约翰 听着
And, John,

12:56.660 --> 12:58.250
如果我大老远的跑到那里
if I come all the way out there

12:58.260 --> 13:00.120
而事实证明 这是浪费我的时间
and this turns out to be a waste of my time,

13:00.130 --> 13:01.980
我要阉了你
I'm gonna castrate you.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.400
我希望你理解
I hope you understand that.

13:03.410 --> 13:05.280
保重 兄弟
Be well, my friend.

13:05.290 --> 13:08.610
我也爱你
I love you too.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.140
他一会过来
He's coming.

13:14.150 --> 13:18.640
别搞砸了
Don't mess this up.

13:46.060 --> 13:47.500
你好
Hello

13:47.510 --> 13:48.990
是我
It's me.

13:49.000 --> 13:49.920
我知道
I know.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.650
我看见"狱友"的号码
I saw "Inmate" on the caller ID.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.900
记得我说过 要你给菲波纳奇打电话?
Remember when I said I might be calling you on Fibonacci?

13:54.910 --> 13:56.320
记得
Yes.

13:56.330 --> 14:00.660
好吧 现在是时候了
Well... it's time.

14:00.670 --> 14:02.680
你看起来心神不宁
You seem distracted.

14:02.690 --> 14:04.840
我猜 很多东西在我脑子里
Got a lot on my mind, I guess.

14:04.850 --> 14:06.640
是么?
Yeah?

14:06.650 --> 14:09.880
与那些拿了这些脚趾的人有关么?
Have anything to do with the people who took these toes?

14:09.890 --> 14:13.100
-花很漂亮  -是的
-Nice flowers.  -Right.

14:13.110 --> 14:14.900
我们有崇拜者么?
Do we have an admirer?

14:14.900 --> 14:16.390
我父亲给的
They're from my father.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.790
哦 为什么送的?
Ah. What's the occasion?

14:19.800 --> 14:23.650
-我的生日  -今天?
-It's my birthday.  -Today?

14:23.660 --> 14:25.190
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.450
谢谢
Thank you.

14:28.460 --> 14:31.430
好吧
OK.

14:32.690 --> 14:34.150
没什么
Nothing.

14:34.160 --> 14:38.100
生日通常不是什么痛苦的话题 是吧
Birthday's aren't usually a sore subject, that's all.

14:38.110 --> 14:41.180
除非庆祝者想到她的年龄
Unless the celebrant is feeling her age,

14:41.190 --> 14:44.710
这一点我在你身上看不出
which I don't see how you could be.

14:44.720 --> 14:49.020
迈克尔 我29岁了 我没有觉得自己变老
I'm 29 years old, Michael. I'm not feeling my age.

14:49.030 --> 14:50.810
不过是29个生日罢了
It's just, out of those 29 birthdays,

14:50.820 --> 14:55.530
我的爸爸实际上就和我呆了6个生日
my father has actually managed to see me on precisely six of them.

14:55.540 --> 14:59.560
因此 取而代之就给我买了一些花
So, I get flowers instead.

14:59.570 --> 15:04.100
花儿最后都会枯死的 一个礼拜后 就会被丢到垃圾桶里
Flowers that end up dead and in the trash a week later.

15:04.110 --> 15:06.570
听起来很伤感 是么?
That sounded bitter, huh?

15:06.580 --> 15:07.950
有点
Kind of.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.790
没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.760
好了 明天见
You are all set. I will see you tomorrow.

15:11.770 --> 15:15.230
好吧
OK.

15:15.910 --> 15:19.450
我很抱歉你那么想
I'm sorry you feel that way.

15:19.460 --> 15:23.740
我是说 花儿的事
About the flowers, I mean.

15:28.700 --> 15:29.920
嘿 过来个人
Hey,someone's get on here

15:29.930 --> 15:32.830
-我想把这些放到其他房间  -我来干老板
-I want these in the other room.  -I got it, boss.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.950
躲开 小白脸 我干了
Hey, chill-lily white. I got it.

15:58.260 --> 16:03.060
来吧 我知道你在附近
Come on,I know you're around here somewhere.

16:31.940 --> 16:34.010
他看上去不怎么好?
He's not doing well, is he?

16:34.020 --> 16:36.790
他的妈妈刚去世
He just lost his mother.

16:36.800 --> 16:42.170
10天后他会失去他的父亲
Ten days from now, he loses his father.

16:48.290 --> 16:52.170
你怎么样?
How are you holding up?

16:54.840 --> 16:57.370
你知道 我
You know, I...

16:57.380 --> 17:02.380
我有点明白你最近的心情 LJ
I sort of get what you're going through here, LJ.

17:02.770 --> 17:06.610
没有冒犯的意思 我不认为你能理解
No disrespect, but I don't know that you do.

17:06.620 --> 17:09.010
我理解你,我爸爸也有同样遭遇
No, with my dad,

17:09.020 --> 17:12.700
我像你这么大的时候 也跟你同样的处境
I was in the same spot when I was your age.

17:12.710 --> 17:14.760
他进了监狱
He was in prison,

17:14.770 --> 17:17.740
就像你爸爸一样 他也是清白的
and my dear daddy was innocent.

17:17.750 --> 17:19.510
怎么了?
What happened?

17:19.520 --> 17:22.240
我是说 最后
I mean, you know, at the end.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.090
就像我现在希望发生的
What I hope happens here

17:24.100 --> 17:27.110
他后来被证明无罪
he got exonerated.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.910
他们说他干了什么?
What did they say he did?

17:28.920 --> 17:31.500
一大堆的坏事
A lot of bad things.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.120
都不是真的
They weren't true,

17:33.130 --> 17:35.210
我们证明了这点
and we proved that.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.070
每一天 每一天都要面临失败...
Every day. Every day was a lost cause,

17:38.080 --> 17:39.610
但我们还是要一直斗争
but we kept fighting.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.810
我是说,不然还能去干什么?
I mean, what else are you gonna do

17:41.820 --> 17:44.850
如果你爱一个人 你会任由他落得那样的下场吗?
when you love somebody? Let them go out like that?

17:44.860 --> 17:46.610
所以你要斗争
So you fight.

17:46.620 --> 17:47.980
一直斗争
You keep fighting.

17:47.990 --> 17:52.400
决不放弃
You never give up.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.340
我们会成功的
We're gonna beat this thing.

17:55.350 --> 17:58.950
对不对?
OK?

18:05.260 --> 18:07.510
-你好  -你好
-Hello.  -Hello.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.830
你在等我拜访
You were expecting me?

18:08.840 --> 18:11.710
-一个我们共同的朋友安排的...  -是的
-A mutual friend arranged it.  -Yes.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.940
-我能不能...  -请吧
-You mind if I...?  -Please.

18:15.950 --> 18:20.020
嘿 你好...
Hey, how are...

18:21.940 --> 18:25.210
-不好意思 我还不知道你叫什么  -奎因
-I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.  -Quinn.

18:25.220 --> 18:28.570
奎因先生 你能告诉我你是来干什么的吗?
Mr Quinn, mind telling us what we're doing here?

18:28.570 --> 18:31.350
你看我的样子应该能看出来了
You can probably tell just by looking at me,

18:31.360 --> 18:33.330
我不是那种惹事生非的人
I'm not a wave-making sort.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.940
你就把我当作一个监督员好了
Just think of me as a supervisor

18:36.350 --> 18:39.420
来确保所有事情都顺利 因为...
who's here to make sure things are under control as we approach...

18:39.430 --> 18:40.810
那个 大事情要来了
you know,the big event.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.330
我倒觉得事情都挺顺利的
I wasn't aware that things were out of control.

18:43.340 --> 18:47.810
你最清楚不过了 不是吗?
Well, you'd be the one that would know,wouldn't you?

18:50.570 --> 18:55.900
其实 我来这里的原因是 你们所知道的事情
Well, the reason I'm here is because there's a discrepancy between what you know

18:55.910 --> 18:58.100
和你们告诉副总统的并不相符
and what you have said to the vice president.

18:58.110 --> 19:00.950
你们想要解决掉的律师 他们现在还安然无恙
The lawyers you tried to blow up are still running around

19:00.950 --> 19:04.650
还是活蹦乱跳的 你们知道 我也知道
healthy as thoroughbreds.You know it,I know it.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.560
那个小孩也一样
Same thing goes with the kid,

19:06.570 --> 19:11.330
你们真是愚蠢至极 居然告诉副总统你们已经把小孩捉到了
who you were silly enough to tell the old lady that you were actually in possession of.

19:11.340 --> 19:14.930
我要说的事情可以归结为
Everything that I'm saying is boiling down to this.

19:14.940 --> 19:17.420
你们现在得把控制权转交我
You gotta hand the reins over to me now,

19:17.430 --> 19:21.520
这样我才能帮你们
so that I can save your ass.

19:25.210 --> 19:28.360
首先...
First of all...

19:28.370 --> 19:30.410
不!
No! No.

19:30.420 --> 19:35.220
瞧? 现在是你逼我动手
See, now you made me make a wave.

19:35.230 --> 19:38.380
你跟你的搭档现在被停职 什么时候复职另行通知
You and your partner are off the job until further notice.

19:38.390 --> 19:41.120
这不是我的命令 也不是白宫的命令
It doesn't come from me,it doesn't come from the White House

19:41.130 --> 19:45.520
是公司的命令 明白了吗?
it comes from the company. You understand?

19:53.720 --> 19:56.380
你的指骨断了两根
Your proximal and middle phalanx are broken.

19:56.390 --> 19:58.680
用冰敷45分钟 然后用夹板固定
just ice it for 45 minutes then splint it.

19:58.690 --> 20:00.250
医生会这样跟你说
That's what a doctor would tell you to do,

20:00.260 --> 20:04.830
所以你现在没必要再去找医生了
so you don't need to go see one.

20:21.530 --> 20:23.660
易科菲尔德公司的SEC档案?
EcoField's SEC files.

20:23.670 --> 20:24.770
特伦斯·斯蒂德曼被杀了
Terrence Steadman was murdered

20:24.780 --> 20:28.000
那么控告他的诉讼文件就应该被公开 对不对?
so information from his indictment wouldn't be public,right?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.920
当然是 但是到现在还没有被公开
Sure,but we have no way of knowing

20:29.930 --> 20:32.390
我们不可能知道他们到底想掩盖什么
what they were trying to cover up.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.490
斯蒂德曼的妻子说如果他丈夫垮了 公司会损失上亿美元
Steadman's wife said there're hundreds of millions of dollars at stake if her husband went down

20:36.500 --> 20:40.270
所以我想沿着钱的线索去找 看看会找到什么
So I figure we follow the money and see where it takes us.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.980
1.09亿美元
109 million,

20:41.990 --> 20:43.290
2.12亿美元...
212 million.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.650
我目前为止发现
Over half a billion dollars I've found so far

20:45.660 --> 20:49.460
超过5亿美元的联邦政府拨款 用于易科菲尔德公司的代用燃料研发
in federal grants to EcoField for alternative fuel research.

20:49.470 --> 20:51.310
真是好大一笔钱
That is a hell of a lot money.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.000
但用来干什么了?
But for what?

20:52.010 --> 20:54.180
不仅仅说公司没创造利润
Not only did the company never make a profit,

20:54.190 --> 20:56.950
据我所知,他们没做出任何东西
as far as I can tell, they never made anything.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.340
没有燃料电池 没有专利 没有新发现 什么都没有
No fuel sales, no patents,no findings, nothing.

21:00.350 --> 21:02.890
那么易科菲尔德公司是假的 只是个掩饰?
So EcoField was a sham. It was a cover.

21:02.900 --> 21:07.070
问题在于 为了什么?
The question is, for what?

21:17.460 --> 21:20.760
菲利
Philly.

21:21.910 --> 21:25.920
坐下,孩子
Sit down, kid.

21:29.550 --> 21:33.520
那么... 菲波纳奇
So... Fibonacci

21:33.530 --> 21:38.710
-怎么能找到他?  -做做功课
-how'd you find him?  -I did my homework.

21:39.370 --> 21:41.880
你再跟我打哈哈
You get elliptical with me for one more second

21:41.880 --> 21:44.070
我就取消交易
and I will cancel you.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.040
明白吗?
You understand me?

21:46.050 --> 21:49.640
配合一点 嫩鸡
Give it up, fish.

21:49.650 --> 21:53.860
在证人被转交给 美国马歇尔部门保护之前
Before someone's transferred to the marshals and placed in protection,

21:53.870 --> 22:01.840
他们在审判所在地由警长看管
they're guarded by a local sheriff from the county where the trial will take place.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.380
请接索罗曼警长
Sheriff Solomon, please.

22:04.390 --> 22:07.140
请稍等
Please hold.

22:07.150 --> 22:10.800
我是安德鲁·索罗曼
Andrew Solomon here.

22:12.770 --> 22:14.350
既然这个警长能接电话
If the sheriff was available,

22:14.360 --> 22:17.280
那肯定不是看管菲波纳奇的那个
he wasn't the one guarding Fibonacci.

22:17.290 --> 22:19.110
普特南郡警长办公室
Putnam County Sheriff's Office.

22:19.110 --> 22:21.490
呃 普罗泽警长在吗?
Yeah, is Sheriff Pronzo there?

22:21.500 --> 22:24.440
对不起 普罗泽警长去度假了
I'm sorry. Sheriff Pronzo's on vacation.

22:24.450 --> 22:26.610
-真的?  -是的,先生
-Really?  -Yes, sir.

22:26.620 --> 22:29.220
整个郡只有4个警长
There are only four sheriffs in the county.

22:29.230 --> 22:32.150
因为普罗泽是唯一不在自己办公室的
Since Pronzo was the only one not in his office,

22:32.160 --> 22:34.510
而且他妻子和孩子都没跟他一起去度假
and his wife and kids were at home,

22:34.520 --> 22:37.750
所以我知道他肯定 是在跟菲波纳奇一起度假
I knew the only vacation he was taking was with Fibonacci.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.990
看守他直到转交保护
Watching him till they could put him in protection.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.780
问题是 有时狱警部门 要花好几个星期才能建立新ID
Thing is, sometimes it takes weeks for the marshals service to set up a new identity,

22:45.790 --> 22:49.870
所有某地方警长就跟菲波纳奇 呆在什么偏僻的地方
so some local sheriff is stuck in the middle of nowhere with Fibonacci.

22:49.880 --> 22:55.800
他觉得孤独 然后不断的打电话回家
He gets lonely and calls home,a lot.

22:56.680 --> 23:01.500
我打电话到通信公司 说我是普罗泽 我把账单弄丢了
I called the phone company,said I was Pronzo and I'd lost my bill.

23:01.510 --> 23:04.700
我要求多要一份
I asked for another copy.

23:04.710 --> 23:12.020
发现普罗泽先生接过很多次的电话 都是从一个远离芝加哥的地方
Mrs Pronzo was receiving dozens of calls from an area code a long way from Chicago.

23:12.030 --> 23:16.400
我上网去 反查这个电话号码 然后
I went online,reverse-traced the number, and voila

23:16.410 --> 23:19.740
就发现了菲波纳奇所在的地址
There was Fibonacci's exact location.

23:19.750 --> 23:23.610
-你怎么知道他还在那?  -我叫人跟踪他...
-How do you know he's still there?  -I have someone looking after him.

23:23.620 --> 23:28.820
远远地监视 怕他搬走了
Watching from afar, in case he moves.

23:30.530 --> 23:31.920
你是想要钱 是不是?
This is about money, isn't it?

23:31.930 --> 23:34.770
-你真是善解人意 法尔曾先生  -什么?

约翰 你的朋友想敲诈我
Your friend here John,is trying to extort me.

23:38.230 --> 23:40.710

我打算有一天要逃出这里
I plan on being out of here one day.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.740

24:07.350 --> 24:08.450
这张照片是谁拍的?
Who took this picture?

24:08.460 --> 24:12.890
既然你能让人在外面监视我们感兴趣的人
Since you took it upon yourself to have some people watch our interests on the outside,

24:12.900 --> 24:16.940
我们也能让人监视你感兴趣的人
we took it upon ourselves to have some people watching yours.

24:16.950 --> 24:18.380
那么你要哪个?
So who's it gonna be?

24:18.390 --> 24:25.410
菲波纳奇还是你这个漂亮的女朋友?
Fibonacci or your pretty little girlfriend there?

24:35.800 --> 24:40.900
嘿 看看你在跟谁说话 嫩鸡
Yeah, you should be careful with who visits you in here, fish.

24:40.910 --> 24:43.020
不要乱说话
These walls have eyes.

24:43.030 --> 24:48.370
如果你敢碰她 我会亲手杀了你
If you touch her,I'll kill you myself.

24:48.380 --> 24:51.030
第一 这是一个无力的威胁
One, that is an empty threat.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.060
你对我来说连个虫子都不如
You are less than a gnat to me.

24:53.070 --> 24:56.430
第二 把地址给我
And two,all you gotta do is give me the address

24:56.440 --> 25:02.390

如果接下来从你嘴里吐出来的不是地址
If the next thing that comes out of your mouth is not that address,

25:27.190 --> 25:33.960

Nice work, John.

26:14.290 --> 26:20.100
我想把我们的约翰·阿布鲁奇 处死未免太夸张了
I guess the demise of John Abruzzi was greatly exaggerated.

26:20.110 --> 26:22.500
多谢 我很感激
Thank you. I appreciate it.

26:22.510 --> 26:26.470

菲利 在你开枪前
And Philly.Before you pull the trigger,

26:35.710 --> 26:43.500
看着那杂种的眼睛 替我向他道别

27:12.340 --> 27:16.900
"在通往世界和平和繁荣的竞争中 美国将始终处于领先"
"In the race toward worldwide peace and prosperity,America will set the pace."

27:16.910 --> 27:18.310
"竞争"?
"Race"?

27:18.320 --> 27:20.120
你死我活 武力竞争
Rat race, arms race...

27:20.120 --> 27:23.090
你能想出一个更槽的词吗?
Can you think of a word with a worse connotation?

27:23.100 --> 27:25.790
搞定它
Fix it.

27:25.800 --> 27:31.460
-你帮我请了个保姆?  -现在谈这个不是时候
-Did you send me a baby-sitter?  -This is not the time or the place.

27:31.470 --> 27:34.940
-现在不是时候 什么时候才是？  -别用那种口气跟我说话
-This is the time and the place.  -Don't take that tone with me.

27:34.940 --> 27:36.560
看看你在和谁说话
Remember who you are talking to.

27:36.570 --> 27:38.830

27:57.100 --> 28:00.050
有些事情你必须清楚...
There is something you need to understand.

28:00.060 --> 28:01.700
如果你完成了你的工作...
If you had done yourjob,

28:01.710 --> 28:04.400
我也不会让奎因来帮忙
I never would've had to ask for Quinn.

28:04.410 --> 28:07.130
你也要弄明白一些事情
And there's something you need to understand.

28:07.140 --> 28:10.950
你把这些家伙招来 就等于唤醒了一头野兽
You woke a sleeping beast when you called these guys in.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.500
他们的手段多得很...
They have a bigger agenda than any of us

28:12.510 --> 28:15.470
他们会用尽一切办法达到目的
and get real nasty real quick if things don't go their way.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.770
到那时 没人是安全的了
So now no one is safe

28:17.780 --> 28:19.210
你不是

28:26.140 --> 28:27.930

我们是一条船上的 对吗?
is that we are in this together, OK?

28:34.100 --> 28:36.640
我所要说的是现在 这些家伙介入到这件事里了
All I'm saying is these guys are into this thing now,

28:36.650 --> 28:38.690
这已经无法挽回了

29:20.250 --> 29:21.790
哦 对不起

29:21.800 --> 29:25.280
她的记录上说你是他的未婚夫...
It's just that her records,they list you as her fiance,

29:25.290 --> 29:27.480

-维罗妮卡现在还好吗?  -恩 有些不幸发生
-Is Veronica OK?  -Well, there has been a fatality.

29:34.830 --> 29:36.260
还有待确认
with any certainty,

29:36.270 --> 29:39.060

Nothing would make me happier.
