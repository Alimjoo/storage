如果你们成功得到“锡拉”

00:05.030 --> 00:06.460
不仅不用坐牢
you'll not only avoid jail time,

00:06.460 --> 00:08.630
而且可以因为帮助国家
but you could take great pride in knowing

00:08.630 --> 00:12.000
除去这个巨大的威胁  而得到奖励
you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat to its own democracy.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.600
如果在执行任务中被杀
If you're killed while doing so,

00:13.660 --> 00:15.900
将会得到体面的葬礼

00:15.960 --> 00:17.830
格雷琴有其余的图纸
Gretchen has the rest of the pages.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.500
除非她把几页纸给我们  否则就无法前进
We can't go any further until she gives them back.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.930
为什么还要这么做
Why are we doing this again?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.060
这是安全保障
It's an insurance policy.

00:23.130 --> 00:24.600
你如果再用枪指着我
You put a gun on me again,

00:24.660 --> 00:27.330
我就连你的指纹也一起取了
and these aren't the only set of prints I'll be copying.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.560
迈克
Mike!

00:31.630 --> 00:35.330
迈克尔  你怎么了  跟我说话  迈克尔
Michael, what's wrong? Talk to me! Michael?

00:35.400 --> 00:38.730
我要"锡拉"明天之内移出
I want Syclla out of Los Angeles by the end of the day

00:38.800 --> 00:40.300
洛城
tomorrow.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.130
布拉德  快出来
Brad, get out of there!

00:44.200 --> 00:46.130
-使劲推  -别这样做
Push it! Don't do this!

00:46.200 --> 00:51.160
布拉德
Brad!

01:01.930 --> 01:03.860
如果出现什么状况
If anything should happen,

01:03.930 --> 01:05.800
给我芝加哥的妈妈打个电话
call my mom in Chicago.

01:05.860 --> 01:07.460
不会有什么状况发生的
Nothing's going to happen.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.300
布拉德的尸体在哪
Where's Brad's body now?

01:12.360 --> 01:15.000
运往停尸房的路上 放在国土安全局的冷柜里
We got it on its way to the morgue, and it's in the cooler

01:15.000 --> 01:16.760
没有人会发现的
at Homeland Security where nobody can find it.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.030
这不是我们之前说好的
That ain't part of the deal.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.000
你说过如果我们发生意外 我们会被送到家人手里
You said if anything happened to us,that we'd be returned to next of kin.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
这不是我当时说的
That's not exactly what I said.

01:22.060 --> 01:23.260
不  这就是你当时说的
No, that is exactly what you said.

01:23.330 --> 01:24.760
我不是那么说的
No, it isn't exactly what I said, okay?

01:24.830 --> 01:27.400
他现在是一具无名男尸  除非我说他不是
And he needs to stay a John Doe until I say otherwise.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.060
我现在要处理的事情已经很多了
Okay? I'm dealing with enough stuff already

01:29.130 --> 01:31.330
而且我的处境也不妙
and I've had my ass chewed out...

01:42.260 --> 01:43.960
他有
He's got...

01:44.030 --> 01:46.430
他还有妈妈  你知道吗
He's got a mother, you know.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.560
如果你还想要"锡拉"
If you want Scylla, and I assume you still do,

01:48.630 --> 01:51.330
就把布拉德·贝里克的尸体运回给他妈
Brad Bellick's body goes home to his mother.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.560
好吧  好吧
All right, all right.

02:00.860 --> 02:02.460
我去处理尸体的事
All right, I'm gonna take care of the body.

02:02.530 --> 02:04.130
但是你们
But you guys

02:04.200 --> 02:06.100
不能再伤感下去了

02:06.160 --> 02:08.130

02:08.200 --> 02:09.900
把布拉德的遗物收拾一下
You need to pack Brad's stuff up,

02:09.960 --> 02:11.930
回到正常的工作上
and we need to get back to work.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.100
还有  费尔南多
And Fernando,

02:13.160 --> 02:15.330
朋友  我忠告你
my friend, let me tell you something.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.600
如果你再碰我一下
If you ever put your hands on me again,

02:17.660 --> 02:19.500
我保证
I promise you, okay,

02:19.560 --> 02:21.300
我让你一起去陪葬
there's gonna be two bodies in the fridge.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.500
我需要答案
But I need results.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.860
我需要缺失的几页纸
Yeah, well, I need to see those missing pages.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.160
你说呢
So, what's it gonna be?

02:37.100 --> 02:40.300
我听说你死了
I heard you were dead.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.460
谁告诉你的
Who told you that?

02:44.060 --> 02:45.960
一只小鸟
A little bird.

02:48.330 --> 02:49.600
你怎么这么大方
That's awfully generous of you.

02:49.660 --> 02:51.500
我要算准时机
It's all a matter of timing.

02:51.560 --> 02:55.030
"公司"要把"锡拉"转移到滨洲的一个地堡里
The Company is moving Scylla to a bunker in Pennsylvania.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.160
-什么时候  -明天
When? Tomorrow.

02:57.230 --> 02:59.400
你在得知后  应该马上给我电话
You want to make sure to mention that on the phone right away, as soon as...?

02:59.460 --> 03:00.660
说实话  作为前雇员
You know, for an ex-employee,

03:00.730 --> 03:02.830
你对公司的现况应该了解很多
you sure seem to know an awful lot about current Company business.

03:02.900 --> 03:05.130
别这么偏激
Don't get paranoid.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.860
我不正在为你们打探消息嘛
I'm keeping one ear to the ground for your benefit,

03:06.930 --> 03:10.160
所以  你们最好跟我合作  而不是针对我
which is a really good reason to work with me and not against me.

03:10.230 --> 03:12.060
好了  我们拿到图纸了
All right, you know what? We got our pages.

03:12.130 --> 03:13.330

Let's go.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.130
那是运输部的安泽

03:27.200 --> 03:29.360
他负责电力传输

03:29.430 --> 03:30.500
鲍威尔  你认识的
And you know Powell.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.600
他监管安全装置
He's supervising the security override.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.530
这是个大工程
It's a big job.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.800
也许我们应该找大卫·贝克
Perhaps we should call in David Baker.

03:37.860 --> 03:39.960
确保安全
Just to be safe.

03:40.030 --> 03:42.130
没必要
That won't be necessary.

03:43.830 --> 03:46.260
我们内部的人就可以完成
We can do this all in-house, huh?

03:46.330 --> 03:49.400
"锡拉"明天就不在这了
And Scylla will be gone by morning.

03:55.530 --> 03:59.600
我答应过布拉德  发生意外就打电话给他妈
I promised Brad I would call his mom if anything happened.

03:59.660 --> 04:01.630

04:05.860 --> 04:07.830
看看这个

04:09.200 --> 04:11.460
警察慈善会时  他留了个徽章
He kept a badge from the police benefit.

04:11.530 --> 04:13.830
他在福克斯河监狱当狱警时
When he was a CO in Fox River,

04:13.900 --> 04:16.160
他考了5次警官学院  都没有通过测试
he-he failed the test to get into the academy five times.

04:26.830 --> 04:28.000
图是真的吧
These are right, right?

04:28.060 --> 04:31.860
这是"公司"地下室的地图  对吧
This is a map of the Company's basement, right?

04:31.930 --> 04:33.630
我不明白  看起来太简单了
I don't know. It looks too simple.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.700
我以为会更复杂一点
I assumed it would be a lot more complicated than this.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.130
这些符号是
These symbols-- they're...

04:39.200 --> 04:42.700
根本没有意义  还有这些字母
They don't make any sense, and the letters, uh...

04:42.760 --> 04:44.860
肯定有什么地方错了
There's just something wrong.

04:44.930 --> 04:46.630
字母C
This letter C--

04:46.700 --> 04:48.500
一般表示散热口
it usually designates some kind of heating vent.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.600
M表示计量器
The M designates a meter.

04:50.660 --> 04:53.860
这是某种冷凝装置
This is some sort of condensing unit.

04:53.930 --> 04:56.200
这是管道设备  叫做P型管
This is a plumbing part. It's called a P-trap.

04:56.260 --> 04:59.830
他们是完全不同的东西
They're all completely dissimilar items.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.530
设计逻辑学里  这些
Logical design dictates they'd never

05:01.600 --> 05:02.830
不能随意安装
be installed that randomly.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.200
根本
It just, um...

05:04.260 --> 05:05.660
一点意义都没有
It doesn't make sense.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.170

05:14.210 --> 05:21.580
C  M  E
C  M  E

05:21.580 --> 05:23.590
是"看我"
That's "See me."

05:23.590 --> 05:24.560
如果把这些字母当符号
These letters don't make any sense

05:24.630 --> 05:25.960
一点意义都没有
if you think of them as symbols,

05:26.030 --> 05:27.830
但从字面意思来看  就有意义了
but they do if you think of them literally.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.960
"你看到我了吗"  他是在问
"Do you see me?" He's asking

05:31.030 --> 05:32.060
如果你看到了
if you see him.

05:32.130 --> 05:33.330
在哪
Where?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.200
在这
Here.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.860
大卫·贝克
David Baker?

05:51.930 --> 05:54.030
但除了你们俩  谁能想到
Yeah, but who besides you two, would come up

05:54.100 --> 05:55.360
这样的点子呢
with something like that, huh?

05:55.430 --> 05:57.900
什么意思呢
I mean, what's the point?

05:57.960 --> 05:59.260
我不知道
I don't know,

05:59.330 --> 06:01.360
如果不找出画这张蓝图的人
but we're never going to figure this blueprint out

06:01.430 --> 06:03.530
我们永远不知道其中的意义
if we can't find the person who drew it.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.900
我们要找出大卫·贝克
We need David Baker.

在你来之前一周

在让别人处理我的私务前
I always make a point of checking out the background

10:58.540 --> 10:59.940
打扰下  先生
Excuse me, sir?

11:00.040 --> 11:01.340
你是业务员吗
Are you a salesman?

11:01.410 --> 11:02.610

11:02.680 --> 11:04.680
有什么可以为您效劳的

我知道你很忙
Well, I can see that you're busy,

11:10.080 --> 11:11.940
但我想让你早点知道
but I didn't want you to be the last to know.

11:12.010 --> 11:14.280
"锡拉"要转移了
Scylla is moving.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.110
移回来吗
Come back?

11:16.180 --> 11:19.840
别担心  我们按原计划行事
Don't worry. We're gonna stick to our original plan.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.380
计划到底是什么
What exactly is the plan?

11:21.440 --> 11:22.480
我们等
We wait.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.680
-等  -没错
Wait? Yes.

11:24.740 --> 11:26.880
你听过手抓鱼吗
Okay, have you ever heard of noodling?

11:26.940 --> 11:28.540
没听过
I don't believe so.

11:28.610 --> 11:30.280
你还真是个乡巴佬
Well, then, what kind of hillbilly are you, really?

11:30.340 --> 11:31.710
我说给你听吧
I'll explain it to you.

11:31.780 --> 11:33.510
手抓鱼
Noodling...

11:33.580 --> 11:35.540
就是一个有勇无谋的莽夫

11:35.610 --> 11:36.980
游到泥泞的河床
to the bottom of a muddy riverbed

11:37.040 --> 11:39.880
把他的手伸到

11:39.940 --> 11:41.280
黑暗无底的洞里
darkest hole.

11:41.340 --> 11:43.080
抓大鲶鱼
He's looking for a prize catfish.

11:43.140 --> 11:46.240
有时  的确有鲶鱼在洞里
Now, sometimes the catfish does live there,

11:46.310 --> 11:47.480
抓鱼者就光着手
and the noodler pulls it out

11:47.540 --> 11:49.640
把鱼拽出来  然后拖回岸边
with his bare hand and he drags it ashore,

11:49.710 --> 11:51.740
但有时候  他把手伸进洞里
but sometimes, he reaches in that hole

11:51.810 --> 11:54.110
却发现里面是啮龟
and he finds a snapping turtle.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.680
直接把他的手咬掉了
Bites his hand clean off.

11:57.710 --> 12:00.240
斯科菲尔德正是抓鱼者

12:00.310 --> 12:01.910

12:01.980 --> 12:03.780
潜入"公司"并拿到"锡拉"
into the Company hole and he finds Scylla,

我们把它夺过来  卖给冯
we take it and we sell it to Feng.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.940
如果他抓到啮龟
If he gets a turtle, well...

12:10.110 --> 12:12.040
断的也不是我们的手
Not our hand.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.410
承包商来了
The contractors are here.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.780
你来这里干嘛
What the hell are you doing here?

12:18.840 --> 12:19.880
我是客户
I'm a client.

12:19.940 --> 12:20.880
你是客户吗
You're a client, huh?

12:20.940 --> 12:22.110
冷静  大家冷静
Just keep it down; keep it down.

12:22.180 --> 12:23.580
这是策略之一
It's all part of the ruse.

12:23.640 --> 12:24.910

12:31.240 --> 12:34.280
你再拿这开玩笑  我就把你的舌头挖出来
If you joke about it, I'll rip your tongue out.

12:35.340 --> 12:37.740
林肯  我们走
Let's go, Linc.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.940
很抱歉打扰你
Sorry to bother you,

12:44.010 --> 12:46.580
我是一名内科医生  我带我丈夫来就诊
but I'm an internist and I brought my husband in.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.810
他刚刚晕倒了
He's in and out of consciousness

12:47.880 --> 12:49.680
并且有一些症状令我担忧
and he's got some symptoms that concern me.

12:49.740 --> 12:52.180
如果能见神经专科医生  我感激不尽
I'd be really grateful if we could see a neurologist.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.340
他有人身保险吗
Does he have insurance?

12:53.410 --> 12:54.980
有的
Uh, yeah.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.010
我没把卡带来
I don't have the card,

12:56.080 --> 12:57.480
但是
but, um,

12:57.540 --> 12:58.880
我带了他的身份证
I have his I.D.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.380
先把这个填好
Just fill this out.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.380
好的  谢谢你
Okay, thank you.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.610
弗里林先生
Mr. Freling?

13:04.680 --> 13:07.010
弗里林先生
Mr. Freling.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.440
是  是我
Yes, that's... that's me.

13:10.510 --> 13:11.980
一直这样吗
Is it always low?

13:13.010 --> 13:15.380
有点
A little.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.310
家里曾经有人患过
Has anyone in your family ever suffered

13:17.380 --> 13:21.040

13:21.110 --> 13:23.840
我妈
My mom.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.010
好的
Okay.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.740
吉米  带这位先生到4号病房
Jimmy, take this gentleman back to bay four.

13:34.710 --> 13:37.380
为什么要转移锡拉
Why are we relocating?

13:37.440 --> 13:39.340
"锡拉"的安全事关
The Scylla's security is the foundation

13:39.410 --> 13:40.540
整个组织
of this entire organization.

13:40.610 --> 13:41.740
我知道
I realize that,

13:41.810 --> 13:43.840
但你考虑过后果吗
but have you thought about the ramifications?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.680
如果我们错失关键时机
If we lose critical access,

13:45.740 --> 13:48.910
会延迟第二阶段的预期时间
it could compromise our timeline on stage two.

13:52.810 --> 13:54.880
图版和设施都已齐全
The plates and the facility are ready

13:54.940 --> 13:58.610
随时可印制任何数量的货币
to print as much currency as we need at any time.

13:58.680 --> 14:02.010
"锡拉"何时能在宾洲安置妥当
When will Scylla be installed in Pennsylvania?

14:02.080 --> 14:04.180
丽莎  预期时间是多少
Lisa, what's our timeline?

14:05.680 --> 14:07.740
实际上  出了点小问题
Actually, there's been a bit of a problem.

14:07.810 --> 14:09.580
拆除锡拉周边的
Dismantling the security

14:09.640 --> 14:11.580
安全装置有点棘手
surrounding Scylla is a bit tricky.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.340
可能比预期要长一点
It may take longer than we thought.

14:13.410 --> 14:15.040
多长时间
How much longer?

14:15.110 --> 14:18.440
我能现在就叫人拆除
I can make this happen right now.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.060
将军有何吩咐
Yes,sir?

14:22.240 --> 14:23.750
把大卫·贝克找来
Go get David Baker.

他现在不接新项目了
He's not taking any new projects right now.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.710
实际上  我想问一些他几年前
Actually, I had some... some questions about something

14:44.780 --> 14:47.040
做的项目的事
that he worked on a few years ago.

14:47.110 --> 14:50.010
你有听过"锡拉"的工程吗
Are you familiar with a project called Scylla?

14:59.010 --> 15:02.410
我正忙呢
I'm working!

15:02.480 --> 15:05.440
这位先生想跟你谈谈"锡拉"
This man would like to talk to you about Scylla.

15:07.510 --> 15:10.410
你是"公司"的人吗
You're Company?

15:10.480 --> 15:11.940
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

15:12.010 --> 15:15.340
我是后勤的  我想请教一些
I'm in logistics, and I'd like to ask you some questions

15:15.410 --> 15:18.180
有关原始设计的问题
about your original design.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.080
我想了很久才设计出来的
It's been a long time since I thought about that.

15:23.140 --> 15:25.110
幸亏还记得一些
Be lucky to remember anything.

15:25.180 --> 15:27.410
看来你挺忙的
Looks like you're pretty busy.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.480
介意我看一下吗
Do you mind if I take a look?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.380
知道吗  贝里克救过我
You know, Bellick saved my life.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.980
什么
What?

15:51.580 --> 15:55.480
我们在巴拿马监狱时
Back when we were in prison in Panama.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.210
帝博格简直疯了  他是个疯子
T-Bag went crazy, he, he went nuts.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.810
发生什么了
What happened?

16:00.880 --> 16:05.580
他把索纳一把火烧了  把全部人都放了
He lit Sona on fire, told everyone to run.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.880
他说  他们不会杀光我们的
They can't shoot us all, he said.

16:08.940 --> 16:10.640
简直乱成一团  老兄  我
It was a stampede, bro, I...

16:10.710 --> 16:11.710
我摔倒了  被人踩踏
I was down getting trampled.

16:11.780 --> 16:13.240
站不起来
I, I couldn't get up,

16:13.310 --> 16:16.540
无法呼吸  我以为我死定了
I couldn't breathe, I thought I was going to die...

16:16.610 --> 16:20.240
然后有人把我拉起来
but then something pulled me back to my feet.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.580
是贝里克
It was Bellick.

16:27.140 --> 16:30.180
他救了我
He saved my life.

17:06.340 --> 17:08.940
要弄倒这堵墙吗
That wall's got to come down?!

17:09.010 --> 17:11.510
除非你有更好的办法
Unless you got a better idea.

17:11.580 --> 17:14.480
好吧
Okay.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.710
什么东西
What was that?

17:22.780 --> 17:26.540
不知道  我好像踩到什么了
I don't know. I think I stepped on something.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.940
怎么回事  林肯
What's going on, Linc?

17:38.280 --> 17:40.610
我不知道  老兄
I don't know, man.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.310
像是某种引爆装置
It's some kind of explosive.

17:50.380 --> 17:51.710
炸弹  那我不是死定了
Explosive? Then shouldn't I be dead?

17:54.710 --> 17:56.710
你要是乱动的话  就死定了
If you move, you'll be.

18:08.700 --> 18:12.080
他们在地下  你打不通的
They're underground, you're not going to be able to reach them.

18:14.110 --> 18:17.080
对
Right.

18:17.140 --> 18:18.340
你知道吗
You know what?

18:18.410 --> 18:20.380
没有你  他们也行的
They'll be fine without you.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.040
对
Right.

18:23.110 --> 18:24.980
你听说过福克斯河监狱吗
You ever heard of Fox River?

18:25.040 --> 18:27.180
或许我们可以边吃晚饭边聊聊
Maybe we could talk about it over dinner.

18:27.240 --> 18:31.080
我有洲际公路边上的红虾海鲜馆的优惠卡
I got a gift card to the Red Lobster over off the interstate.

18:32.740 --> 18:36.380
我没想到他们会为布拉德·贝里克这么伤心
I never thought the guys would be so sad for Brad Bellick.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.680
在福克斯河监狱  很多事情都变了
A lot of things have changed since Fox River.

18:40.940 --> 18:43.340
你要知道你掌控不了这些
You know you can't control this.

18:43.410 --> 18:44.780
真的
Yeah?

18:44.840 --> 18:48.580
真有趣  我刚想跟你说同样的话
It's funny, I was just about to tell you the same thing.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.240
不管如何  我们都能应对
Whatever it is, we can manage it.

18:52.310 --> 18:55.710
只要知道我们要应对的是什么
We just need to know what we're dealing with.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.610
如果我不想知道呢
What if I don't want to know?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.440
凯文·弗里林
Kevin Freling

19:28.180 --> 19:30.880
只需几分钟而已
Should only take a few minutes.

19:30.940 --> 19:32.110
准备好了吗
You ready?

19:32.180 --> 19:34.140
好了
I'm ready.

19:47.310 --> 19:50.840
我的目标是建立一个完全自给的城市
My goal is to build one city that entirely self-sustains,

19:50.910 --> 19:54.110
不依靠任何外部资源
depending on no outside resources.

19:54.180 --> 19:57.010
一个完全和谐的社会
A community living entirely in harmony.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.910
还需多久才能转变成现实
How close is it to becoming a reality?

19:59.980 --> 20:01.710
这得看舆论反应了
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

20:01.780 --> 20:02.810
人们认为这些
People look at something

20:02.880 --> 20:06.240
都是不可能的
like this and they think it's impossible.

20:06.310 --> 20:09.080
在现实中  我第二天就能实现这个设想
In reality, I could make it happen tomorrow.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.440
正如他们在迪拜所建设的
Like what they built in Dubai.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.080
没错  把伟大设想
Exactly-- grand ideas

20:13.140 --> 20:15.510
转变成现实
brought into reality.

20:17.540 --> 20:20.610
这不仅只是有益于富人
This won't just serve the rich.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.740
你为他们工作多久了
How long have you been working for them?

20:33.180 --> 20:35.110
太久了
Too long.

20:35.180 --> 20:37.680
94年加入的
I came in in '94.

20:39.710 --> 20:41.810
我从不习惯固定工资
I was never good at collecting a paycheck.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.510
一直是自由职业
Always freelance.

20:43.580 --> 20:48.210
基本上不断辞职
Partially retired all the time.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.340
我喜欢完成一项工作后就往前发展
I like to finish a job and then move on.

20:51.410 --> 20:54.110
把完成的事置于脑后
Put it in the past.

20:54.180 --> 20:57.080
你总是只留名字
Do you always leave your name behind,

20:57.140 --> 20:58.710
而不留正确的工程细则吗
instead of the correct specifications?

21:00.440 --> 21:02.910
只在"锡拉"工程如此而已
Only on the Scylla project.

21:02.980 --> 21:05.480
我们正在考虑修改方案
Well, we're considering modifications and...

21:05.540 --> 21:07.340
我希望你能
I was hoping that you...

21:07.410 --> 21:09.440
帮我指明
could help me figure out

21:09.510 --> 21:12.210
那些蓝图上确切指的是什么
what should really appear on those blueprints.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.680
因为  现在看不出多少意义
As of right now, they don't mean much.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.510
你看了图标符号吗
Didn't you read the legend?

21:18.580 --> 21:21.140
当然
Sure.

21:21.210 --> 21:23.610
但我们还有很多麻烦
But we still had a lot of trouble.

21:27.980 --> 21:30.040
你不是"公司"的人
You're not Company.

21:33.610 --> 21:36.680
我该怎么办
What should I do?

21:36.740 --> 21:37.410
保持冷静
Stay calm.

21:37.410 --> 21:39.180
怎么冷静  你说我踩上地雷了
Calm?! You just said I'm standing on a bomb!

21:39.240 --> 21:40.580
我们会有办法的
We'll work it out.

21:43.910 --> 21:46.210
难道是格雷琴陷害我们
You think Gretchen set us up?

21:57.480 --> 21:58.740
由公司的
"The lessons

21:58.810 --> 22:01.040
创始人哈维·霍尔先生
taught by our founder, Mister..."

22:02.880 --> 22:04.110
传授的课程
"...Harvey Hall."

22:05.810 --> 22:09.080
通向个人自由的路径
"Pathway to personal freedom."

22:09.140 --> 22:10.980
那些人会听这些废话吗
Do people actually buy this nonsense?

22:16.280 --> 22:17.510
放开我
Let go of me.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.740
要么跟我来  要么把你从玻璃门砸过去
You're coming with me or through that glass.

22:18.810 --> 22:19.810
选吧
Choose.

22:19.810 --> 22:22.680
这可是办公地点
This is a place of business.

22:30.810 --> 22:34.310
伽特帮我们找到通向
GATE allows us to find the pathway

22:34.380 --> 22:36.480
个人自由的路径
to personal freedom.

22:36.540 --> 22:39.440
定义我们的范围
Define our boundaries.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.480
并且超出范围考虑
See past them.

22:42.540 --> 22:45.080
让我告诉你们这项伟大工程的
Let me tell you a story about the founder

22:45.140 --> 22:47.140
创始人的故事
of this great program.

22:54.380 --> 22:57.310
我还是给你们讲比这个俗套的老故事
You know, I'm gonna tell you a better story

22:57.380 --> 23:00.440
更棒的故事  有关被囚禁的故事
about captivity than the regular old spiel.

23:02.140 --> 23:03.410
几年前
Years back,

23:03.480 --> 23:06.380
我在一个当地重罪监狱
I was providing volunteer leadership

23:06.440 --> 23:08.840
当志愿者领导
in a local penitentiary.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.840
我和一个壮硕魁梧又弓形腿的
I worked with the head guard,

23:12.910 --> 23:15.940
守卫队长布拉德共事
a big, burly, bowlegged Brad.

23:16.010 --> 23:17.380
和恶魔一样可恶
Mean as the devil.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.340
所有罪犯都很怕他  甚至是谋杀犯
All the prisoners were afraid of him, even the murderers.

23:22.140 --> 23:23.410
有一天  布拉德对我说
And one day, Brad said to me,

23:23.480 --> 23:25.180
科尔  我要你离开这里
"Cole, I want you to get out of here.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.080
我要你立刻离开这里
"I want you to get out of here right now,

23:27.140 --> 23:30.010
因为我知道你是个热爱自由的人
'cause I can tell you're a man who loves freedom."

23:30.080 --> 23:32.180
我说  布拉德  那你呢
And I said, "Well, what about you, Brad?

23:32.240 --> 23:34.010
你呢
What about you?"

23:34.080 --> 23:36.110
他说  我嘛
He said, "Oh, yeah, I'm... I'm...

23:36.180 --> 23:38.810
退休时我就自由了
I'm gonna be free someday when I retire."

23:41.080 --> 23:44.880
最近我得知他去世了
I recently got the news that he had passed away.

23:46.740 --> 23:49.480
他在哪过世的呢
And where was he?

23:49.540 --> 23:52.610
还在那个监狱
Still in that prison.

23:52.680 --> 23:56.340
仍然囚禁在充满消极思想的监狱里
Still in the captivity of negativity.

24:06.610 --> 24:07.640
抱歉  各位
Sorry, folks.

24:15.740 --> 24:19.040
老布拉德
Old Brad.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.510
正如我老爸所说的
As my papa used to say,

24:28.580 --> 24:31.740
站直  拿稳酒杯
"Stand by, your glasses steady,

24:31.810 --> 24:35.980
为你的战友干杯
"and drink to your comrade's eyes.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.910
向已故的人致敬
"Here's a toast to the dead already,

24:38.980 --> 24:42.880
为后继的人欢呼
and hurrah for the next to die."

24:44.880 --> 24:46.710
为了确保
I needed to make sure

24:46.780 --> 24:48.610
我能拿到你的诊断结果
that I would have access to your test results,

24:48.680 --> 24:50.740
我跟分拣护士说
so I told the triage nurse

24:50.810 --> 24:52.110
我是你的妻子
that I was your wife.

24:55.780 --> 24:57.680
说得真有一套
Has a nice ring.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.380
你是凯文·弗里林吗
Are you Kevin Freling?

25:01.440 --> 25:03.840
我是
Yes, I am.

25:03.910 --> 25:05.010
我是摩尔登医生
I'm Dr. Malden.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.210
我是神经专科医生  你是
I'm a neurologist. And you're...

25:06.280 --> 25:08.110
我是卡梅伦·艾勃兰  我是一名内科医生
Cameron Eberline. I'm a... an internist.

25:08.180 --> 25:09.680
有结果了吗
Do you have the results?

25:09.740 --> 25:11.140
还要等一会
It's gonna take a little while.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.910
通过家族病史
Uh, looking at the family history,

25:12.980 --> 25:14.610
我想让你留院观察
I'd like to admit you here.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.940
我们在安排病房
We're working on a room.

25:16.010 --> 25:17.110
就现在
Just for now,

25:17.180 --> 25:18.510
直到拿到检查报告
until we get the test results back.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.340
我觉得没必要  但还是谢谢你
I don't think that'll be necessary, but thank you.

25:20.410 --> 25:21.710
你最好能在
It would be best if you could rest

25:21.780 --> 25:22.710
有看护的地方休息
where you could be monitored.

25:22.780 --> 25:23.880
之后  我们再决定
After that, we'll determine

25:23.940 --> 25:25.310
最佳治疗方案
what the best course of action is.

25:25.380 --> 25:26.410
同意吗
Agreed?

25:26.480 --> 25:28.040
抱歉  我们得走了
I think we have to go. I'm sorry.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.640
等等  多长时间
Hold on, hold on-- how long... how long will it take

25:30.710 --> 25:31.810
-能拿到结果  -几小时
to get the results? Couple of hours.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.040
期间我们会给你安排一间病房
But we'll get you in a room before then.

25:34.110 --> 25:35.780
-在这稍等  -谢谢
Just wait here. Thank you.

25:37.780 --> 25:39.640
过来吧
Come on.

25:47.340 --> 25:48.740
你知道会怎样吗
You know what happens?

25:48.810 --> 25:50.280
他们会控制你的生活
They take over your life.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.440
你没法自己掌控
You don't own it anymore.

25:51.510 --> 25:54.040
事情不像你说的那样
That is not what happened to me.

25:54.110 --> 25:55.810
不管怎样  你过去没惹上麻烦
Then, somehow you stayed out of trouble.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.010
你按他们说的做了
You did what they told you to do.

26:00.010 --> 26:02.940
这正是你被困在这的原因  对吧
Maybe that's why you stuck around, huh?

26:03.010 --> 26:04.410
困在洛杉机
Right here in Los Angeles.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.080
而我  他们抓到我的把柄
In my case, they had something on me,

26:06.140 --> 26:08.510
他们利用这点穷追不舍
and they used it and they never let me go.

26:08.580 --> 26:11.480
他们杀人无数
They've killed hundreds, thousands of people

26:11.540 --> 26:13.780
谋权求势  你一清二楚
in the pursuit of power, you know that.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.240
我们昨天就牺牲了一名想阻止他们的同志
We lost a good man yesterday trying to stop them.

26:16.310 --> 26:18.110
他们伤害了太多人  大卫
They hurt a lot of people, David.

26:18.180 --> 26:19.780
大卫
David.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.440
听着
Look...

26:21.510 --> 26:24.140
我不参与政治
I stay out of the politics.

26:24.210 --> 26:25.710
那只是份工作
It was a job.

26:25.780 --> 26:28.280
我专门负责安全工程
I specialized in security engineering.

26:28.340 --> 26:30.810
"锡拉"工程只是个选择性的任务  所以我就接受了
The Scylla project was a choice assignment, so I took it.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.940
他们告诉你那是什么了  对吧
They told you what it was, didn't they?

26:33.010 --> 26:34.380
他们跟你说了它  如今
They told you what it was, and now

26:34.440 --> 26:36.610
你希望你从没帮过他们  但你被骗了
you wish that you never helped them, but you're trapped.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.040
正如我被陷害一样
You're trapped like I was.

26:38.110 --> 26:39.540
你说得好像就在眼前的事
You talk like it's all in the present.

26:39.610 --> 26:40.840
确实如此
It is!

26:50.110 --> 26:51.810
我知道你想忘掉过去
I know you want to move on.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.310
看看你在做什么
Look at what you're doing.

26:53.380 --> 26:55.140
你在努力弥补吧
Are you trying to make up for something?

26:55.210 --> 26:57.340
忘了美好的未来吧
Forget the charitable city of the future,

26:57.410 --> 26:59.980
还是关心一下你眼前的生活吧  大卫
and worry about the world that you live in right now, David.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.610
他们做过的  他们要做的
What they did.what they're doing.

27:01.710 --> 27:03.210
都不是我的错
is not my fault.

27:11.140 --> 27:12.840
你把名字留在那里肯定有原因
You put your name in there for a reason.

27:12.910 --> 27:14.080
你想让人找到你
You wanted someone to find you,

27:14.140 --> 27:16.440
如果你说出我想要的信息
and if you tell me what I need to know,

27:16.510 --> 27:18.710
我能为彼此做出努力
I can do something for both of us.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.140
你丈夫在哪
Where is your husband?

27:23.210 --> 27:25.140
他出去办公了  一会才能回来
He went to run some errands-- he should be right back.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.480
车道停的不是他的车吗
That's his car in the driveway, isn't it?

27:28.540 --> 27:31.510
稍等  我打电话叫他
Just a moment. I'll call him on his cell.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.080
-你们干嘛  -要求派人前后包抄
Excuse me.I request southeast to work.

27:42.580 --> 27:44.350
你早就知道  对吧
You knew about this, didn't you?

27:44.420 --> 27:47.420
首先  我不知道
First of all, I have no idea

27:47.480 --> 27:49.080
"公司"为何
why the Company would want

27:49.150 --> 27:50.180
在自己楼下
to put an explosive device

27:50.250 --> 27:51.650
放何种爆炸装置
of any kind under their own building.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.350
-我们在中庭下方  -告诉你
We're under the courtyard. And you know what,

27:53.420 --> 27:54.720
我完全不知情
I honestly had no idea

27:54.780 --> 27:56.380
这里会有这些东西
that any of this was even here.

28:00.580 --> 28:02.880
这么看来
That being said...

28:05.020 --> 28:08.380
这看起来像JZ33杀伤性地雷
These look a lot like JZ33 anti-personnel blast mines.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.950
过去  在费卢杰
Back in Fallujah,

28:11.020 --> 28:14.220
伊斯兰游击战士把它们埋在基地外面
the Muj used to bury them outside their firm base.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.280
除掉他们
Get rid of them.

28:16.350 --> 28:19.780
我不是专家  但我有主意
I'm no expert, but I have an idea.

28:19.850 --> 28:21.520
什么在哔哔叫
What's beeping?

28:21.580 --> 28:23.080
哔哔声啊
It beeps!

28:24.550 --> 28:27.050
你肯定直接踩到上面
Wow, you must've stepped on this just right.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.950
你的重心平均
Your weight is evenly distributed

28:29.020 --> 28:30.020
分布在压板上
across the pressure plate,

28:30.080 --> 28:31.980
没有触动引线
and you haven't engaged the firing pin.

28:32.050 --> 28:33.550
一英寸你都不能挪
You can't move an inch.

28:33.620 --> 28:34.580
我们知道
We know.

28:34.650 --> 28:36.080
你有什么主意
What's your idea?

28:36.150 --> 28:37.850
我的想法是他挪一英寸
Well, my idea is that he moves an inch.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.320
这样  我就能深入洞里
That way, I can get to the hole,

28:39.380 --> 28:40.720
拆除引线
and I can dismantle the firing pin.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.780
他现在站在上面  我无能为力
Right now, he's standing on it, and I can't do anything.

28:42.850 --> 28:44.420
不行  林肯  打电话给你弟弟[西班牙语]
No, no, no, Linc,  llama tu hermano.

28:45.880 --> 28:48.480
-什么  -快打电话给你弟弟
What? Call your brother, please.

28:48.550 --> 28:50.550
你给我呆在这里
You-- you stay here.

28:50.620 --> 28:52.650
行
Fine.

28:53.780 --> 28:55.120
是我哥哥
It's my brother.

28:55.180 --> 28:56.320
迈克尔
Michael...

28:56.380 --> 28:58.320
我们走
Let's go.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.650
莎拉
Sara...

29:03.720 --> 29:04.880
你们不是要走吧
You're not leaving, are you?

29:04.950 --> 29:07.280
你有我们的号码
You have our number.

29:07.350 --> 29:08.280
你到底是谁
And who are you again?

29:08.350 --> 29:09.420
他想在家等结果
He prefers to wait at home.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.150
-我会照看他  -他可能有危险
I'm monitoring him. He's leaving AMA

29:11.220 --> 29:13.180
不能离开医院
in a potentially fragile condition.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.820
听着  我不是傻瓜
Look, I'm not stupid.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.620
我知道你们是谁
I know who you are,

29:16.680 --> 29:17.950
我不会告发你们
and I'm not gonna turn you in.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.580
我关心的是
My concern is for what's going on

29:19.650 --> 29:20.820
你的健康
with your health.

29:22.250 --> 29:23.320
他们不是来抓你们的
They aren't here for you,

29:23.380 --> 29:24.450
我告诉你  以你的状况
and I'm telling you, in your condition...

29:24.520 --> 29:26.620
谢谢你医生  我很感激你帮忙
Thank you, Doctor; I appreciate your help.

29:27.650 --> 29:29.180
拜托打电话给我们
Please do call us.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.680
有事吗
Can I help you?

29:47.580 --> 29:49.120
我搞砸了
I messed up.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.050
什么意思
What do you mean?

29:51.120 --> 29:53.050
今天  我跟巴格维尔一起办事时
Today, I was working with Bagwell.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.680
他很顺从
He's been compliant as hell.

29:54.750 --> 29:56.720
我想我可以让他高兴
I thought that I would make him happy.

29:56.780 --> 29:58.980
-他想谈论格雷琴·摩根  -行  到底怎么了
He wanted to talk about Gretchen Morgan. Right, and what happened?

29:59.050 --> 30:00.820
而我说漏嘴了
And I slipped up.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.350
我提到惠斯勒了
I mentioned Whistler.

30:02.420 --> 30:05.350
我告诉你这很棘手
This one is tough, I'm telling you.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.050
巴格维尔  格雷琴·摩根  他们很凶残
Bagwell, Gretchen Morgan-- they're thugs.

30:08.350 --> 30:09.920
我不止一次被人
I have been face down with a gun

30:09.980 --> 30:11.880
拿枪指着我的头
to the back of my head more than once.

30:16.650 --> 30:18.250
好吧
All right.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.750
听着  我不想让你去做
Look, I don't want you to do something

30:20.820 --> 30:22.980
你不想做的事情
that you don't want to do.

30:23.050 --> 30:24.420
你是个好特工  我们可以安排其他人
You're a good agent-- we could reassign...

30:24.480 --> 30:26.420
不  我不是这个意思
No, no, that is not it.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.050
听着  我能搞掂这个
Look, I can handle this.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.080
我只是
I'm just...

30:29.150 --> 30:31.420
我只是在鞭策自己
I'm just kicking myself.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.350
我可以安排其他事给你做
I could find something else for you to do, okay?

30:34.420 --> 30:36.480
这件事你就别管了
This thing has gotten way out of hand.

30:36.550 --> 30:38.650
达洛在后方  并且"公司"正在转移"锡拉"
Dallow is on my back, and the Company is moving Scylla...

30:38.720 --> 30:40.420
不
No.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.350
我能行
I'm fine.

30:43.380 --> 30:45.050
你确定吗
Are you sure?

30:46.280 --> 30:48.720
唐  我真的觉得我们能行
I really think we can do this, Don.

30:50.180 --> 30:52.250
我们能搞垮"公司"
We can bring the Company down.

30:54.420 --> 30:58.020
我把名字记在蓝图上完全是自负
Ego is the only reason I coded my name into those blueprints.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.680
我不觉得有什么好心虚的
I don't feel guilty about anything.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.820
我得接这个电话  不好意思
I gotta take this. I'm sorry.

31:01.880 --> 31:02.820
喂
Hello?

31:02.880 --> 31:04.880
-阿历克斯 我们  -怎么了
Alex, we...What?

31:04.950 --> 31:05.950
有麻烦了
Got a problem.

31:06.020 --> 31:07.620
那里有个该死的雷区
There's a damn minefield down there.

31:08.750 --> 31:10.320
喂  我听不清
Hello, I can't hear you.

31:10.380 --> 31:11.650
苏克雷有麻烦了
Sucre's in trouble.

31:11.750 --> 31:12.880
他踩到地雷了
He's standing on a mine.

31:12.950 --> 31:14.150
我们得把它拆了
We need to deactivate it.

31:19.780 --> 31:21.280
林肯  我得挂了  一会打给你
Linc, I gotta go. I'll call you back.

31:23.450 --> 31:24.450
他们来了  大卫
They're here, David.

31:26.020 --> 31:28.150
-他们想从我这要什么  -他们在转移"锡拉"
What do they want from me? They're moving Scylla,

31:28.220 --> 31:29.550
保护它  所有你为他们做的
protecting it-- everything you did for them,

31:29.620 --> 31:32.050
他们想让你再做一次
they want you to do it again.

31:32.120 --> 31:33.450
你觉得你能阻止他们吗
You think you can stop them?

31:33.520 --> 31:34.820
我了解你
I know all about you.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.120
我六个月前就知道了
I've known about you for six months.

31:37.180 --> 31:38.450
自从有人从公司偷了
ever since somebody stole those plans

31:38.520 --> 31:39.780
设计图
from the Company.

31:39.850 --> 31:40.980
一切都是徒劳
It will never work.

31:41.050 --> 31:42.450
你们连第一堵墙都过不去
You won't get past the first wall.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.680
第一堵墙指什么
What about the first wall?

31:43.750 --> 31:46.020
有什么障碍  雷区吗
What's gonna stop me, huh? The minefield?

31:50.720 --> 31:53.350
千万别告诉他们
Please... don't tell 'em.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.480
我们抓到他了  清理现场
We've got him. Sweep the area.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.980
山脚下有条泥路
There's a dirt road at the bottom of the hill.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.240
从那条路出去
It will take you out.

32:41.310 --> 32:42.680
-你丈夫  -只管走
Your husband... Just go.

32:42.740 --> 32:44.440
他帮不了你  这个东西可以
He won't help you; that will.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.860
"锡拉"工程
Scylla Project

32:51.580 --> 32:54.010
林肯  再给他打电话
Lincoln, go call him again.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.710
林肯  快打啊
Linc, go call him.

32:55.780 --> 32:57.140
快啊  林肯
Linc, go call him!

32:57.210 --> 32:58.780
迈克尔知道怎么处理吗
What will Michael know about this?

32:58.840 --> 33:01.240
这完全超出他的知识领域
I mean, it's not exactly within his realm of expertise.

33:01.310 --> 33:02.310
我们这是浪费时间
We're wasting time.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.640
我给的是半专业化建议
I gave you a semiprofessional assessment.

33:04.710 --> 33:05.880
那又如何
What's wrong?

33:05.940 --> 33:07.340
你不相信我吗  费尔南多
You don't trust me, Fernando?

33:08.740 --> 33:11.110
他为何要相信你
Why should he?

33:11.180 --> 33:13.510
因为我们的目标一致  "锡拉"
Because we all want the same thing: Scylla.

33:13.580 --> 33:15.040
我不会让一大包爆竹
And I'm not gonna let a giant pack

33:15.110 --> 33:16.340
挡我们的路
of firecrackers stand in our way.

33:16.410 --> 33:19.280
要不我给你找个拆弹小组
Or would you like me to call the bomb squad?

33:20.740 --> 33:23.180
听着  我现在是好心相助
Look, I am offering to do you a massive favor here.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.340
我拆引线时  这东西要是炸了
If that thing blows while I'm pulling the pin,

33:25.410 --> 33:27.510
他丢的是一条腿  我丢的可是头
he loses a leg-- I lose a face!

33:32.680 --> 33:34.840
费尔南多  别担心
Now, don't worry, Fernando.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.480
我出了名手稳
I'm known for my steady hand.

33:41.510 --> 33:43.510
深呼吸  好吧
Take a deep breath, okay?

33:43.580 --> 33:46.240
保持重心平稳
Keep your weight even.

33:46.310 --> 33:49.240
然后慢慢移动
And I need you to shift slowly,

33:49.310 --> 33:51.140
慢慢的
very slowly--

33:51.210 --> 33:54.910
往左挪一英寸  我就能拆引线了
one inch to your left, so I can get to the pin.

33:54.980 --> 33:58.840
不行  我做不到
Oh, no, I can't... I can't, I can't do it.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.980
你还好吧
Are you all right?

34:02.040 --> 34:04.680
有什么消息吗
Have you, uh, heard anything?

34:04.740 --> 34:06.380
他们得拆除它
They have to deactivate.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.880
我拿到张图表
I got a key.

34:07.940 --> 34:09.710
蓝图中的图标符号
A legend to the blueprint.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.640
-贝克给你的吗  -不是
Baker gave you this? No.

34:11.710 --> 34:14.480
他老婆给我的  他们找上贝克了
His wife gave it to me. They came for Baker.

34:14.540 --> 34:17.340
好了  这样就清楚多了
All right, well, this makes more sense.

34:17.410 --> 34:19.580
这些符号
These, uh, these symbols

34:19.640 --> 34:22.580
不是代表P型管  代表的是
aren't for p-traps, they're...

34:22.640 --> 34:24.580
麦克风
they're microphones.

34:24.640 --> 34:27.410
字母V代表真空装置
And the letter "V" isn't for vacuum,

34:27.480 --> 34:30.280
那是发电机
that's a generator.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.280
这是一条JZ33的布雷线
This is a line of JZ33 land mines

34:35.340 --> 34:37.740
埋在地下8毫米处
buried 80 millimeters underground,

34:37.810 --> 34:39.740
离外墙大概有7英尺
about seven feet from the outer wall

34:39.810 --> 34:41.780
肯定是林肯和我说的事
that's must be what Linc was talking about.

34:43.910 --> 34:48.780
上面说  只能手动操作
It says, "Manual override only.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.910
所有常规拆除JZ33的方式
All conventional attempts to dismantle the JZ33

34:50.980 --> 34:52.610
均会触发"锡拉"警报
will activate the Scylla alarms."

34:54.340 --> 34:56.310
这不仅仅是个地雷
This isn't just a land mine.

34:56.380 --> 34:59.080
还是个报警器
This is, uh... this is an alarm.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.480
我们不能耗一个晚上
We can't sit here all night.

35:04.540 --> 35:09.640
准备好了吗
Okey?You ready?

35:23.810 --> 35:27.180
我是林肯  你知道怎么做
it's Linc. You know what to do.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.610
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

35:54.380 --> 35:56.340
林肯
Linc!

35:56.410 --> 35:58.380
苏克雷
Sucre!

36:03.780 --> 36:04.940
住手
Stop!

36:05.010 --> 36:06.380
快住手
Stop!

36:06.440 --> 36:07.380
别动
Don't move.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.410
别动
Don't move.

36:08.480 --> 36:09.510
千万别的
Don't move.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.840
不关掉警报
You can't dismantle the land mine

36:13.910 --> 36:15.780
-你是拆不了地雷的  -也就是说
without setting off the alarm. So I either

36:15.840 --> 36:16.810
不但关不了警报
set off the alarm

36:16.880 --> 36:18.040
-我还会被炸死  -不
or blow up and die. No.

36:18.110 --> 36:20.340
有一个手动装置
There's a manual override.

36:22.210 --> 36:24.680
切断电源后有足够时间
It'll cut the power long enough for you

36:24.740 --> 36:27.240
让你不拆引线退后
to step off without removing the pin.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.280
你怎么肯定吗
How do you know for sure?

36:29.340 --> 36:31.440
我找到大卫·贝克了
I found David Baker.

36:38.110 --> 36:39.740
苏克雷  退后
Sucre. Step off.

36:40.980 --> 36:42.180
你可以的
You can do it. You only have

36:42.240 --> 36:43.880
你只有20秒时间  快点
20 seconds. Come on.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.880
-我做不到  -你可以的
I can't... Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

36:45.940 --> 36:47.210
我和迈克尔研究过了
Michael and I figured it out.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.240
现在就退后
Step off right now.

36:48.310 --> 36:49.580
不  你们都走吧  我
No, no, you guys all go. I'll--

36:49.640 --> 36:51.480
我们不必都死  我自己承担吧
We all don't have to die. I'll do it alone.

36:51.540 --> 36:52.640
今天没有人会死
Nobody's gonna die today!

36:52.710 --> 36:54.710
退后
Step off!

36:57.880 --> 37:00.180
退后
Step off.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.810
墙后面是什么
What's behind this wall?

37:41.840 --> 37:43.840
锡拉
Scylla.

38:08.210 --> 38:09.980
你们什么时候能知道结果
When do you find out?

38:11.480 --> 38:16.010
医生随时都有可能打电话来
The doctor is supposed to call, uh... any minute.

38:16.080 --> 38:18.010
听着
Look, um...

38:18.080 --> 38:21.040
我很抱歉今天没去帮你们
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you today.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.480
别担心
Don't worry about it.

38:23.540 --> 38:25.640
格雷琴为苏克雷所做的
You know, what Gretchen did for Sucre

38:25.710 --> 38:27.640
让我觉得我们可以信任她
made me realize we could use her.

38:27.710 --> 38:29.680
我问她要第六张卡
I asked for the sixth key.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.680
她怎么说
What'd she say?

38:31.740 --> 38:33.710
她在努力
She's on it.

38:41.940 --> 38:44.040
你没事吧
You all right?

38:44.110 --> 38:46.010
好了
All right.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.480
我们准备去机场
We're about to go to the airfield.

38:47.540 --> 38:49.510
把布拉德的尸体运给他母亲
We're gonna ship Brad's body off to his mother.

38:49.580 --> 38:50.680
他的遗物都在这
Got his things here.

38:50.740 --> 38:52.110
他在哪
Where is he?

38:52.180 --> 38:54.780
这边
Over here.

39:49.510 --> 39:52.080
他妈妈会为此感激的
His mother will appreciate that.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.140
贝里克夫人
Mrs. Bellick.

40:17.210 --> 40:19.180
我是费尔南多·苏克雷
This is Fernando Sucre.

40:31.540 --> 40:33.240
今天干的不错
Great job today.

40:33.310 --> 40:34.910
我对你朋友的死感到遗憾
I'm sorry to hear about your friend.

40:34.980 --> 40:36.740
但那是令人尊敬的工作
But that's, um, admirable work,

40:36.810 --> 40:39.110
志愿看管那样一群罪犯
volunteering with a bunch of criminals like that.

40:39.180 --> 40:42.410
我们都是一样的
We're all the same, really.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.180
这是你要的
Here's the application you requested

40:45.240 --> 40:46.280
前台的申请表
for the desk girl.

40:46.340 --> 40:47.310
谢谢
Thanks.

40:47.380 --> 40:49.080
祝你晚上愉快  科尔
You have a good night, Cole.

40:49.140 --> 40:50.980
你也是  谢谢
You, too. Thanks.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.280
喂
Hello?

41:19.340 --> 41:21.340
喂
Hello?

41:24.410 --> 41:25.510
好的
Okay.

41:25.580 --> 41:26.680
我们会的
We will.

41:26.740 --> 41:28.510
谢谢
Thank you.

41:28.580 --> 41:30.010
吃过一番苦头
As we've all learned the hard way,

41:30.080 --> 41:32.680
我们已知道在地基周边
there's an electronic alarm barrier

41:32.740 --> 41:35.710
装有电子报警设备
around the perimeter of the foundation.

41:35.780 --> 41:37.710
不幸的是
Unfortunately,

41:37.780 --> 41:40.610
那是锡拉最外层的防线
that is Scylla's most primitive line of defense.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.610
那面墙
The wall itself

41:42.680 --> 41:45.180
用钢纤维设防
is fortified with steel fiber.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.740
好消息是  在里面
The good news is, on the inside here,

41:47.810 --> 41:49.910
没有监控录像
there are no cameras.

41:49.980 --> 41:52.340
公司不想留下任何
The Company doesn't want any

41:52.410 --> 41:54.340
证明"锡拉"存在的视觉图像
visual evidence that Scylla exists.

41:54.410 --> 41:56.240
坏消息是  这边和这边
The bad news is that there are both

41:56.310 --> 41:59.910
都有重量和扩音传感器
weight and microphonic sensors here and here

41:59.980 --> 42:01.940
一旦有任何超过
that will alert Company Security

42:02.010 --> 42:04.280
2磅的活人出现
to the presence of any breathing human being

42:04.340 --> 42:07.110
就会拉响"公司"的安全警报
that weighs more than two pounds.

42:10.310 --> 42:13.080
我现在能确定的
as far as I can tell,

42:13.140 --> 42:15.940
第一个挑战  是避开那堵墙
the first challenge is getting around that wall.

42:16.010 --> 42:18.840
然后再考虑如何跨过那块地
And then we can worry about crossing the floor.

42:18.910 --> 42:20.880
不能碰到地面
Without touching it.

42:20.940 --> 42:22.880
还得悄无声息
In silence.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.280
太复杂了
It's complicated.

42:24.340 --> 42:28.240
但我已经在研究了
But, uh, I'm already working on something.

42:31.940 --> 42:34.410
布拉德没有白白牺牲
Brad didn't die in vain.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.980
我们会成功的
We can make this work.

42:47.240 --> 42:50.610
神经专科医生打来的电话
That was the neurologist.

42:50.680 --> 42:53.640
你长了个下丘脑错构瘤
You have a hypothalamus hamaratoma.

42:53.710 --> 42:54.910
十分罕见
It's really rare.

42:54.980 --> 42:57.840
你可能天生就有
You were probably born with it.

42:57.910 --> 43:00.780
情况变了  肿瘤在变大
Um, things have changed-- it's been growing,

43:00.840 --> 43:03.780
所以你会出现这些症状
which is why you've been experiencing your symptoms.

43:03.840 --> 43:07.280
医生认为你得动手术
And the doctor feels that you need surgery.

43:07.340 --> 43:09.140
再等两天
Two days.

43:09.210 --> 43:11.180
我只需要两天
That's, uh, that's what I need.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.080
不  明天就得做
No. Tomorrow.

43:13.140 --> 43:15.980
否则你会死的  别无选择
Otherwise you could die, and there's no alternative.
