WEBVTT

00:08.700 --> 00:10.460
你看到镜子里的那人了吗?
Did you see the guy in the viewing room?

00:10.550 --> 00:11.210
没有
No

00:11.350 --> 00:12.300
是爸爸
It was Dad.

00:14.690 --> 00:15.920
我认识这家伙
I know that guy.

00:23.590 --> 00:24.350
是什么?
What is it?

00:24.470 --> 00:26.480
这是嵌在迈克尔·斯科菲尔德皮肉里的纤维
It was fused into Michael Scofield's skin.

00:26.510 --> 00:27.520
从哪来的?
Where'd it come from?

00:27.550 --> 00:29.690
依我看 是狱警制服上的
As far as I can tell, a guard's uniform.

00:30.390 --> 00:31.290
怎么了?
What's wrong?

00:31.430 --> 00:32.230
监狱的蓝图
The blueprints,

00:32.320 --> 00:35.140
从精神病区通往医务室的那部分
the ones we need to get from the psych ward to the infirmary,

00:35.170 --> 00:36.310
不见了
they're gone.

00:46.740 --> 00:48.840
嘿 看起来不错呵
Hey, that's looking good.

00:49.590 --> 00:51.240
还真挺有进展
You're making some real progress.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.080
石灰泥增加了重量
The plaster adds a lot of weight.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.800
我也许得加固下
I may have to add reinforcements.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.800
怎样都行 只要能赶上我的婚礼纪念日
Whatever it takes, as long as you get done in time for the anniversary.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.730
我会完成的. 拿住这个
It'll be done. Hold this.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.700
你知道 伊朗王十分喜爱泰姬陵
You know, the Shah loved his Taj so much

01:03.840 --> 01:06.470
因此他在河对岸又造了一个一模一样的庙宇
that he built another temple just like it on the other side of the river.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.100
几乎完全一样
It was an absolute mirror image.

01:08.190 --> 01:10.950
只是黑了一点 可以说是"黑色泰姬陵"
Except it was darker, it was like a black Taj Mahal.

01:11.610 --> 01:12.840
从没听说过
Never heard of it.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.130
那是因为这工程从未完工
Well, that's 'cause it was never completed.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.830
在他完工之前 他的政权被他最爱的儿子推翻了
He was overthrown by his favorite son before he could finish it.

01:19.620 --> 01:24.060
-听起来像个神话故事似的  -不 这100%是真的
-Sounds like a myth.  -No, it's 100% true.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.050
我觉得是
I think.

01:25.980 --> 01:29.130
打扰一下 狱长 医生要见你
Excuse me, Warden. Dr. Tancredi is here to see you.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.640
谢谢
Thank you.

01:33.210 --> 01:36.310
亚当 带斯科菲尔德先生 回牢房去吧
Adams, please escort Mr. Scofield back to his cell.

01:40.890 --> 01:42.510
医生 有什么需要我效劳的吗?
Doctor, what can I do for you?

01:42.600 --> 01:45.030
其实是和斯科菲尔德有关的 长官
Actually, it's about Scofield, sir.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.240
进去谈
Come in.

01:53.070 --> 01:54.110
斯科菲尔德怎么了?
What about Scofield?

01:54.230 --> 01:56.180
他的背部被烫得相当的严重
The burn on his back is fairly serious.

01:57.530 --> 01:58.830
他看上去恢复的不错
He seems to be recovering.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.690
起先我以为他是被另一个囚犯所伤
At first, I assumed he was being assaulted by another inmate,

02:02.720 --> 02:05.120
但我在他的皮肤里面发现这个
but I found this embedded in the skin on his back.

02:05.150 --> 02:06.050
这是什么?
What's this?

02:06.840 --> 02:07.690
是纤维
It's fabric.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.290
狱警制服上的
Came from a guard's uniform.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.740
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

02:27.060 --> 02:29.160
我试着回忆那些丢失的通道...
I'm trying to remember those blueprints,

02:29.900 --> 02:31.900
那些被烫掉的部分
what we lost to the burn.

02:32.830 --> 02:36.880
没有那部分 我们绝不可能通得过 精神病区的地下管道
Without them, we'll never be able to navigate those pipes beneath psych ward.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.720
-现在如何?  -不行
-Any luck?  -No.

02:41.550 --> 02:44.840
我曾花了很长时间研究整张设计图...
I spent a lot of time studying those blueprints,

02:45.680 --> 02:48.060
没日没夜的研究
tracing them night after night,

02:48.200 --> 02:51.630
思考每一条可能通往医务室的路线
considering every possible route to the infirmary.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.460
这感觉就像是对你10年前学的东西 再来一次测验一样
It's like trying to take a test you studied for 10 years ago.

03:02.930 --> 03:04.360
P.I.(狱工)!
P.I.

03:16.050 --> 03:18.770
真不知道怎么给他们搞成那样
How do they get like that, I got no idea.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.140
我知道 扯过的口袋太多了
I do. Tugging on too many pockets.

03:21.230 --> 03:22.750
她扯过你的口袋了??
She tug on your pocket?

03:22.940 --> 03:26.510
我爱好交际 但我还是个有底线的人
I may be social, but that's the boundary line even I won't cross.

03:29.090 --> 03:31.240
怎么样了? 什么时候能行动?
So how about it, Fish? When we rolling out?

03:31.270 --> 03:33.090
还差一点 我已经在着手了
One hiccup left, but I'm working on it.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.270
是吗 还差什么?
Yeah, and what is that?

03:34.400 --> 03:36.850
我们的路线还不是太完善
Our road map's a little incomplete at the moment.

03:39.540 --> 03:42.060
我不明白 为什么不再下去看看?
I don't get it. Why not just go down there again?

03:42.200 --> 03:44.640
因为 第一: 我没有狱警服了
'Cause, one, I don't have the guard's uniform anymore,

03:44.670 --> 03:47.290
就是说我没办法穿过院子 或者说后勤室
which means I can't get across the yard or past the orderly.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.840
第二: 即使我去成了 那里也是一团糟
And two, even if I did, it's a mess down there.

03:51.870 --> 03:52.910
我需要这个
I need this.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.730
你觉得你能记起来吗?
You think you're gonna remember it?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.370
你不要催我就行
Not with you hounding me.

04:01.710 --> 04:04.910
收工了 外面要开始大扫除
Time to wrap it up. We're going to have you start exterminating.

04:04.990 --> 04:06.100
这边还没完工呢
We're not done in here.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.380
我看是差不多了
Well, you look done to me.

04:07.410 --> 04:09.740
没呢 地毯什么的都还没动过
No, CO, we still got the carpet to do, man.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.080
不用了 贝利克会叫专业人员来做
No, Bellick is going to bring professionals in to do that.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.610
他想把工作做得好点
Wants the job done right.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.400
-他们什么时候来?  -明天
-When's that going to happen?  -Tomorrow.

04:24.050 --> 04:26.620
这下我们惹上大麻烦了 不是吗?
We got a real problem on our hands, don't we?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.290
那帮家伙一进来
Rug monkeys gonna come in here,

04:28.320 --> 04:30.860
掀开地毯 那个洞就会喜迎他们的到来
 tear up that carpet and that hole's gonna be smiling up at them.

04:30.890 --> 04:33.040
-我们得把它填上  -我们才刚刚挖好
-We'll have to fill it in.  -We just dug that bitch.

04:33.070 --> 04:34.600
我们只需要一块夹板
All we need is a piece of plywood

04:34.630 --> 04:37.550
然后在上面涂上几英寸厚的速干混凝土
and a couple inches of that fast-setting concrete on top of it.

04:37.580 --> 04:40.030
铺地毯的人发现不了这个洞的
The carpet guys will never know there's anything beneath it.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.530
如果我们要出去
And the night we break out,

04:41.620 --> 04:43.870
只需用个大锤子砸碎它就行了
we'll just smash through with a sledgehammer.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.140
好了 干活吧
Well, okay. Let's get on it.

04:49.230 --> 04:51.900
我们只剩下几个小时的时间了
We've only got a couple hours to get this thing done.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.130
嘿 颓纳 见过艾弗卡托吗?
Hey, Tweener. You met Avocado?

05:01.300 --> 05:02.910
嘿 别来无恙啊?
Yo, what's up?

05:03.640 --> 05:06.690
瞧 她还是个孩子
Lookit. She's just a baby.

05:08.610 --> 05:09.840
走吧
Hit road.

05:14.660 --> 05:16.180
坐
Have a seat.

05:21.230 --> 05:22.260
那么...
So...

05:23.520 --> 05:26.330
斯科菲尔德那边有什么消息不?
Scofield. What's the 911?

05:26.420 --> 05:31.290
没什么 我真不太清楚 我不常和他们呆一块儿
It's 411, and I don't know, man. I ain't up in his car.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.480
知道吗 艾弗卡托要找个新狱友
You know, Avocado's looking for a new cellie.

05:33.510 --> 05:35.960
老大 拜托 我想和他们套近乎
Boss, come on, man, I'm trying to break bread with the man,

05:35.990 --> 05:38.600
但我接近不了他们 除非我和他们一块儿干活
but I can't get jack unless I can get to the table.

05:38.740 --> 05:40.070
知道我的意思吗?
You know what I'm saying?

05:40.220 --> 05:43.690
斯科菲尔德那帮家伙全在P.I里面 他不需要我
Scofield got his own peeps up in PI. He don't need me.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.540
这东西多久会干?
How long this stuff take to dry?

05:48.630 --> 05:50.100
一 二个小时
One, two hours.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.070
警报
Fire on the line.

06:15.470 --> 06:18.760
这地方好啊 我听说这里要装卫星电视
This place is sweet. I heard we're getting satellite.

06:18.850 --> 06:20.990
可以看很多A片了 老大
Yeah, all the porn you can watch, boss.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.320
不错 不错
Good, good.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.560
你们的活干的很漂亮
You know, you girls

06:24.590 --> 06:27.540
我想再来个帮手应该会更好
I thought you could use an extra pair of hands on the crew.

06:37.850 --> 06:38.690
好啊?!
What's up?

07:22.900 --> 07:25.900
嘿 伙计们 看我这把刷子 都粘在一块儿了
Hey, man, look at my brush. It's all sticking together.

07:26.030 --> 07:28.030
得派个人出去把这个弄干净
Somebody needs to go clean them out.

07:29.230 --> 07:33.900
论资格 应该是 你了
According to rank, that would be you.

07:35.910 --> 07:37.240
我该怎么做?
What do I gotta do?

07:37.420 --> 07:40.520
院子里有水管 你用那个吧
There's a hose out by the shed in the yard. You can use that.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.570
也把这些弄干净了
Clean those, too.

07:49.370 --> 07:50.750
好吧
All right.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.540
抱歉搞杂了你们的聚会
Sorry I busted up the party, yo.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.240
他是谁?
Who is he?

08:15.380 --> 08:18.250
你只需知道 
For your purposes, all you need to know

08:18.280 --> 08:20.520
照片中的这家伙曾经也为这家公司卖力 后来变得吊儿郎当
is that man in the photo used to work for the Company. He went rogue.

08:20.610 --> 08:22.610
他怎么卷进来的?
And how's he involved in this situation?

08:22.650 --> 08:24.220
他是布伦斯的父亲
He's Burrows' father.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.730
等 等 等
Wait, wait, wait.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.270
你挑了个公司里人的儿子做替罪羊?
You picked the son of a Company man to be our patsy?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.860
公司知道吗?
Did the Company know?

08:30.970 --> 08:34.050
公司知道 就这些
The Company did know. That was the whole point.

08:34.420 --> 08:35.860
你能不能帮忙解释一下?
How about you elaborate on that?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.990
你能不能不要问这些问题?
How about you stop with all the questions?

08:38.310 --> 08:42.130
你是个挺不错的保镖 就这样
You are a glorified bodyguard, that's it.

08:42.170 --> 08:45.790
你的工作是被人看到 而不是被人听到 明白了吗?
Your job's to be seen, not to be heard. Is that understood?

08:53.480 --> 08:56.040
-好了吗?  -哦 差不多快好了
-How close are we?  -Oh, we're good to go, baby.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.790
-又有人来了  -这是怎么了 狂欢派队?
-Got another badge.  -What is this, happy hour?

09:12.220 --> 09:14.970
斯科菲尔德? 狱长要见你
Scofield? Pope wants to see you.

09:15.070 --> 09:17.370
其他人收工 这里到此为止
The rest of you round up, you're done in here.

09:17.530 --> 09:20.730
嘿 帕特森狱警说我们要干到天黑
Hey, CO Patterson said we had till the end of the day to finish up.

09:20.770 --> 09:22.150
我说你们可以走了
And I say you're done.

09:22.290 --> 09:25.790
太阳下山前 院子里的有些活你们必须完成
There's a couple hours of work I want done in the yard before sundown.

09:27.070 --> 09:29.020
快 行动
Come on, let's go.

09:30.930 --> 09:32.840
-我们死定了  -还没有
-We're dead.  -We're not.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.650
-我会搞定的  -今晚必须弄好
-I'll get it done.  -It's gotta be done tonight.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.010
我说了我会搞定的
I said I'll get it done.

09:36.130 --> 09:37.990
斯科菲尔德 监狱长在等你
Scofield, Pope's waiting.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.040
嘿 林肯
Hey, Linc.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.480
让我出去吗?
You going to let me out?

09:49.600 --> 09:52.700
不 林肯 我是来告诉你 他们又定了日期
No, Linc, just came to let you know they set a new date.

09:52.830 --> 09:54.820
检察院重新查看了所有文件
DOC refiled all the paperwork.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.110
行刑日为下周5的凌晨
Execution's a week from Friday at midnight.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.720
能让我去院子里走走吗?
You going to let me out in the yard or what?

09:58.750 --> 10:00.870
除非狱长下命令 否则我没这个权力 抱歉
Unless I hear it from the Pope himself, I can't do it. I'm sorry.

10:00.900 --> 10:04.380
拜托了 老兄 就10分钟 我只要求10分钟
Come on, man, 10 minutes. That's all I'm asking. Ten minutes.

10:05.260 --> 10:06.540
抱歉
I'm sorry.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.070
某个家伙走进法院
Some guy just walks into the courtroom,

10:14.100 --> 10:17.210
扔下一些医学纪录 林肯就获得了缓期执行
drops off some medical records, Lincoln gets a stay of execution,

10:17.240 --> 10:19.190
然后他就这么消失了
then "poof," he disappears into the cold.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.550
你觉得可能是谁 某个狂热的死刑反对分子?
Who do you think it could be, some anti-death penalty fanatic?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.690
别傻了 这不可能
Oh, come on, in this case, I doubt it.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.610
没有名字 也没有文档 我们根本无从查起
But without a name or a paper trail, we got no way of getting to him.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.200
所以说我们一无所获了
So once again we have nothing.

10:29.340 --> 10:32.150
能得到两个礼拜的缓期 不能说是一无所获吧?
I wouldn't exactly call a two-week stay nothing, okay?

10:32.250 --> 10:33.780
情况至少比昨天要好
It's more than we had yesterday.

10:33.810 --> 10:35.090
能问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you a question?

10:35.380 --> 10:38.150
你是否真的认为 我们能查个水落石出?
Do you really think that you're going to get to the bottom of this?

10:38.180 --> 10:40.000
或者他们会让我们查个水落石出?
That they'll let you get to the bottom of this?

10:40.030 --> 10:41.740
这些人并不存在
These guys don't exist.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.520
你用法律对付他们 他们会反过来用它来对付你
You go after them with the law, and they'll just use it against you.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.930
我们尽最大的努力 好吗?
We're doing the best we can, okay?

10:48.060 --> 10:50.920
法律是将他们绳之以法的唯一手段 LJ
Law's the only way we're going to bring them to justice, LJ.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.670
他们枪杀了我母亲
They gunned my mother down, man.

10:52.810 --> 10:54.710
你觉得还有什么公正不公正?
You think I give a damn about justice?

10:54.720 --> 10:57.200
我要他们死 以其人之道还其人之身
I want them. I wanna do to them what they did to me.

10:57.230 --> 10:58.320
行了 LJ
Come on, LJ.

10:58.650 --> 11:00.420
这是由法院决定的 不是我们
It's for the courts to decide, not us.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.030
听着 他们总会有疏忽的时候
Look, they're going to slip up, okay?

11:02.060 --> 11:04.310
总有些证据是他们驳不倒的
They're going to leave a piece of evidence that can't be refuted.

11:04.340 --> 11:06.930
会有机会让我们抓住这些证据的
And we're going to be waiting to nail them when they do.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.540
或许他们已经疏忽大意了
Maybe they already slipped up.

11:12.550 --> 11:14.410
小屋边 井里面
Up at the cabin, at the well.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.150
魁恩
Quinn.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.540
被人盖上了
Somebody covered it up.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.390
一定是有人把他救走了
They must have come and gotten him.

11:22.090 --> 11:23.940
揭开再下定论
There's only one way to find out.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.120
看 他的手机
Look, there's his cell phone.

11:41.860 --> 11:42.750
慢点
Easy.

11:47.130 --> 11:50.790
好 再低一点 再低一点
Okay, a little lower!

11:58.000 --> 11:59.190
好 我拿到了
Okay, I got it.

12:08.630 --> 12:09.670
你没事吧?
You okay?

12:10.370 --> 12:11.610
是的 我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.180
拉我上去
Pull me up.

12:27.870 --> 12:29.670
我想和他单独谈谈 加里?
Would you give us a minute, Gary?

12:32.420 --> 12:36.050
迈克尔 我要你绝对诚实
Michael, I want you to be absolutely honest with me.

12:36.460 --> 12:43.230
唐克雷蒂医生发现 这东西嵌在你的皮肤里面
Dr. Tancredi found this embedded in your flesh when she was treating you.

12:43.340 --> 12:46.290
显然 这是狱警制服上面的
Apparently, it came from a guard's uniform.

12:46.370 --> 12:48.380
你是不是被哪位警卫打了?
Have you been assaulted by an officer?

12:51.040 --> 12:55.670
迈克尔 迈克尔 我要你回答
Michael, Michael, I need an answer.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.940
这不再是一个坚守狱友准则的问题了
This is not about sticking to the inmates' code anymore.

12:58.990 --> 13:01.820
这是一个警卫的行为检点问题 是我的责任
This is about officer misconduct. That's my responsibility.

13:01.850 --> 13:04.050
你不想看到我丢饭碗 不是吗?
You wouldn't want to see me lose my job now, would you?

13:04.080 --> 13:04.980
不 当然不想
o, of course not.

13:05.030 --> 13:08.070
你对我和哥哥都很不错
You have been very good to me and my brother.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.570
那我得知道你怎么会被烫伤的 现在
Then I need to know where you got that burn. Right now.

13:12.460 --> 13:16.750
否则 你将被单独禁闭 明白吗?
Otherwise, your ass is going to solitary. You understand?

13:16.850 --> 13:18.040
随你选
It's your choice.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.390
-听我说  -冷静点!
-Don't... Hey, please, listen to me.  -Cool down!

13:24.520 --> 13:27.440
听我说 别这么做! 别这么做!
Listen to me, don't do this! don't do this!

13:30.470 --> 13:31.560
迈克尔!
Michael!

13:32.820 --> 13:33.570
不!
No!

13:48.970 --> 13:49.970
迈克尔
Michael?

13:52.940 --> 13:56.280
迈克尔? 迈克尔?
Michael? Michael?

14:01.210 --> 14:02.120
林肯?
Linc?

14:02.260 --> 14:04.060
你怎么会在这儿的?
What the hell are you doing in here?

14:05.790 --> 14:09.170
林肯 我们惹上大麻烦了
Linc, we're in a lot of trouble now.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.150
发生什么事了?
What happened?

14:11.280 --> 14:15.560
狱长问了我些问题 我很难回答
The Pope asked some questions that I couldn't answer.

14:15.890 --> 14:17.020
关于什么的?
About what?

14:17.440 --> 14:22.510
他有证据证明 我出现在我不应该出现的地方
He's got proof that I was where I wasn't supposed to be.

14:22.650 --> 14:24.600
他还不知道 
He doesn't know it,

14:24.600 --> 14:26.750
他迟早会搞清楚整件事情的来龙去脉的
but sooner or later he's going to put the whole thing together.

14:26.770 --> 14:28.360
没办法了
There's no way out of this.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.480
不 有办法的 你一定要有信念
Yeah, there is. You just got to keep the faith.

14:31.810 --> 14:32.900
不
No.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.570
我倾注了所有心血  结果却功亏一篑
I put my blood into this, and it's coming apart.

14:36.730 --> 14:37.770
听我说
Listen to me.

14:37.950 --> 14:42.050
禁闭的目的就是要搞垮你
The whole point of solitary is to break you,make you crazy.

14:42.130 --> 14:45.080
你必须学会坚强 听到了吗?
You got to keep strong, you hear me?

14:45.290 --> 14:47.360
别让他们击垮你
Don't let them break you.

14:47.460 --> 14:49.740
我倾注了所有心血
I put my blood into this.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.900
宝贝 很抱歉我现在才联系你
Look, baby, I'm so sorry it took me so long to get back to you.

14:58.630 --> 15:02.990
搞了半天我们师近日不会被调离了
Turns out that our division is not getting mobilized for a couple more days.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.960
收不到你的消息 我真的不知所措
When I didn't hear from you, I didn't know what to think, baby.

15:05.990 --> 15:09.950
我好担心 不停的看新闻 注意伤亡人员的名单
I got so worried. I started watching the news, looking for casualties.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.350
我很对不起 但你要相信
I'm so sorry about all this. You gotta believe that.

15:14.370 --> 15:16.750
我打电话给后遣分队办公室
I started calling the rear detachment office,

15:16.890 --> 15:20.080
询问117分队是否出了什么事
asking if there was some sort of problem with the 117th.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.670
没有 117分队没出任何问题
No. There's not a problem with the 117th.

15:26.770 --> 15:29.280
我们快回来了 这里的情况 就是有点乱七八糟 就这些
We're coming back. It's a snafu, that's all.

15:29.420 --> 15:32.070
再几天我们就可以回来了 宝贝儿
A couple more days, and we'll be on those hops, baby.

15:32.270 --> 15:35.050
可后遣分队的长官不是这么说的
That's not what the rear detachment officer said.

15:35.220 --> 15:38.800
他说117分队要6个月后才能回来
He said the 117th wasn't coming home for another six months.

15:38.940 --> 15:42.800
什么? 哦 不 那不可能
What? No. That can't be right.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.100
-他就是这么说的  -啊 你知道为什么吗?
-That's what he said.  -You know what it is?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.850
是由于调度的原因
It's because we're transpo.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.030
你知道 严格讲 我们队是从140师分遣出来的
You know, technically we're on a loan-out from the 140th.

15:52.130 --> 15:53.930
所以他才那么说
I mean, that's why he said that.

15:54.210 --> 15:57.170
-140师?  -是的 是
-The 140th?  -Yeah, yeah.

15:58.170 --> 16:01.630
只要再几天就行了 我是说...
It's just a few more days. That's all. I mean,

16:01.780 --> 16:06.040
你没必要打那些电话 我会回来的 好吗?
you don't need to go calling anyone. I'll be back, okay?

16:06.110 --> 16:10.450
我一知道确切日期就马上告诉你
I will call you as soon as I know the exact date.

16:10.540 --> 16:15.010
-好吗? 我爱你  -我爱你
-Okay? I love you.-I love you.

16:27.390 --> 16:28.710
迈克尔被关单独禁闭了
Michael's in the SHU.

16:28.850 --> 16:31.090
哦 天 这坏事是一个接一个
Oh, God, the hits just keep coming!

16:31.510 --> 16:34.080
伙计们 不到最后就不要慌张
Last thing we wanna do now is panic, fellas.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.320
现在足以让人慌张的了 老头
Oh, it's panic time, old head.

16:36.550 --> 16:39.410
房间里的那个洞还没完工
We got an unfinished hole in that room over there

16:39.500 --> 16:41.330
斯科菲尔德本应该晚上去把它搞定的
that Scofield was supposed to fill tonight.

16:41.360 --> 16:45.600
明早8:00点 他们一揭开毯子 我们就玩完了
Come tomorrow 8: 00 a.m., they rip up that carpet, our game is over.

16:45.930 --> 16:48.690
除非谁把它填好
Unless someone else fills it.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.910
没错 你是唯一一个能从水槽后通向外面的
That's right, papi.You're the only one with a toilet open to the outside world.

16:54.940 --> 16:56.610
你是说让我今晚一个人过去?
You're saying I go out there by myself tonight?

16:56.640 --> 16:57.930
我们就是这个意思
That's exactly what we're saying.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.310
开什么玩笑? 那不可能
Are you kidding? That's impossible.

16:59.340 --> 17:01.350
我现在不想听你说"不可能"
Look, I don't wanna hear impossible from you right now!

17:01.380 --> 17:02.780
还有个人在等着我 
I got people waiting on me,

17:02.820 --> 17:06.010
一个我可能会失去的人 除非你让我赶快从这儿出去
people that I'm gonna lose, unless you man up and get some cojones, comprende?

17:06.040 --> 17:08.580
你说起来容易 命悬一线的不是你
That's easy for you to say, pendejo. It ain't your ass on the line.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.460
我们所有人都命在悬梁
All of our asses are on the line.

17:10.650 --> 17:13.400
现在只有你能为大伙做点什么
And you're the only cat that can do something about it.

17:15.330 --> 17:17.730
是啊 也许我能走出我的牢房
Yeah, maybe I can get out of my cell.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.270
也许我能进到警卫室
And maybe I can get into the guards' room.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.730
但如果我那么做了 且把洞填平了
But even if I do, and I fill that hole in,

17:21.850 --> 17:24.100
我仍会在那个房间
I'll still be in that room.

17:24.340 --> 17:26.250
已经被封住了 你叫我怎么出去
I'll be sealed in. There's no way out.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.210
斯科菲尔德一定还有其他路线
Scofield must've had a way.

17:29.020 --> 17:30.240
他确实有
He did.

17:30.660 --> 17:32.300
上次他走过的那条壁炉路线
The grate at the sally port.

17:32.410 --> 17:34.210
哦 对?开阔地中央的那个洞
Oh, that's right. The one out there in the middle of the open?

17:34.240 --> 17:35.830
是啊 你最好准备好 伙计
Yeah, so you better lace up, amigo,

17:35.860 --> 17:38.160
因为你可能得跑着去洞那边
'cause you're gonna have to make a run for it.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.660
如果我被抓住 那可是一个10年徒刑啊
That's 10 years on my bid if I get caught.

17:40.690 --> 17:43.120
所以最好想办法不要被抓住
Then you better figure out a way not to get caught.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.200
列队!
Line it up!

17:47.030 --> 17:50.320
今晚 伙计 只能是今晚
Tonight, primo. It's gotta be tonight.

18:27.700 --> 18:28.690
迈克尔
Michael.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.380
你没事吧?你在干什么?
You okay? What you doing?

18:33.870 --> 18:36.700
试着回想精神病区下面的构架
I'm trying to remember what's beneath psych ward.

18:36.890 --> 18:38.900
你不应该想这个问题
You're thinking about the wrong thing.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.790
你应该想如何从这个禁闭出去
You got to think about how to get out of here.

19:16.930 --> 19:17.810
迈克尔
Michael.

19:20.440 --> 19:24.060
来 跟我说说话
Man, come on. Talk to me.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.150
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

19:53.270 --> 19:57.020
你们要我干那事 你也总得为我做点事儿
If I'm gonna be the one doing that running, you gotta do some lifting, too.

20:03.650 --> 20:06.150
你知道你在要求我干什么吗?
I mean, you know what you're asking of me?

20:06.240 --> 20:08.110
你在为全队效力
You gotta do it for the team.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.610
嘿 老妹 你那花短裤露出来了
Hey, sister. Your bloomers are showing.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.280
哦 宝贝 不是露出来 是骄傲地飞出来
They aren't showing, baby, they're flying. Proudly.

20:29.180 --> 20:32.140
我就把你当成是一派对女孩了
I take it you are a party girl.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.880
L.J.? 快 我们走了
LJ? Come on, we're leaving.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.670
好
Okay.

21:03.230 --> 21:06.780
只要能把魁恩的手机换个电源 里面的信息肯定很宝贵
We get Quinn's phone powered up and it could be a gold mine of information.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.200
不对 对不上
No. Doesn't fit.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.310
能找到一块合适的充电器就行
We just need to find the right adapter.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.920
魁恩怎么办? 我们就把他丢在这儿?
What about Quinn? Are we just gonna leave him here?

21:14.180 --> 21:16.230
那个从后面开枪打我的家伙?
You mean the guy who shot me in the back?

21:16.780 --> 21:19.670
对 我们就把他留在这儿
Yeah, we're just gonna leave him here.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.850
你若敢告诉别人 我就...
You tell anyone about this, and I...

21:36.770 --> 21:39.210
今早在国会大厦的辩论第一次陷入僵局
Capitol Hill saw its first deadlock of the term on the Senate floor this morning.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.380
辩论的结果两边不相上下
The hotly contested energy bill ended up in a 50-50 tie.

21:44.530 --> 21:48.630
这意味着副总统 莱娜斯的那一票是最关键的
That means it will now be up to Vice President Reynolds to cast the deciding vote.

21:48.700 --> 21:52.190
我知道自己像个破掉的留声机 但你工作太努力了
I know I sound like a broken record, but you work too hard.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.770
你应该多去外面玩儿 拉上一帮朋友什么的
You need to get out, hang out with your friends more.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.790
男人怎么样?
What about men?

21:56.010 --> 22:00.110
如果这是你对我社交的看法 我一定会很凄惨
If this is your exposé on my social life, it's about to be a real sad one.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.970
我 恩... 我一碰到恋爱的事 就走霉运
I... I've had some bad luck when it comes to relationships.

22:05.060 --> 22:07.420
是运气差还是男孩子太坏了?
You had bad luck or you had bad boys?

22:08.470 --> 22:10.770
我想我两者都有
I think I've managed to have a little of both.

22:12.110 --> 22:15.410
是的 你说得没错 我就没打算找个好男孩
Yeah, you know, you're right. I don't tend to go for the nice guys.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.590
我喜欢那种内心深藏不露的家伙
I like the ones with the deep-seated emotional issues

22:17.620 --> 22:19.930
我可以改造他们 然后变成我自己的
I can internalize and make my own.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.500
-比如说斯科菲尔德?  -不 不是斯科菲尔德那种
-Mmm-hmm. Like Scofield?  -Nope, not like Scofield.

22:24.580 --> 22:27.660
别骗人了 每次他来你那儿打针
Don't lie to me. Every time he comes in for his shot,

22:27.800 --> 22:30.910
你要花上20分钟帮他卷袖子
you spend 20 minutes rolling up his sleeve.

22:31.060 --> 22:33.180
知道吗? 他确实很有意思
You know what? I think he's interesting.

22:33.930 --> 22:37.320
而且很有魅力 但他仍是个囚犯
And I think he's attractive, but he's still an inmate.

22:37.410 --> 22:38.510
我可以向你保证
I can promise you one thing.

22:38.560 --> 22:42.360
你绝对不会看到 我和一个囚犯擦出火花
And that's that you will never see anything happen between me and an inmate.

23:38.880 --> 23:39.800
迈克尔
Michael.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.780
什么?你说什么?
What? What'd you say?

23:50.920 --> 23:52.460
我倾注了所有心血
I put my blood into this.

26:32.730 --> 26:35.880
站住!站住别动!跪下!
Stop! Freeze right there! Get down on your knees!

26:35.970 --> 26:38.180
请别开枪!
Please don't shoot! Don't shoot!

26:50.800 --> 26:55.500
伊利诺伊州的法律对企图逃跑的犯人并不怎么仁慈的
You know the state of Illinois doesn't look too kindly upon prisoners who try to escape.

27:02.490 --> 27:06.260
被指控的话 你会被送回县监狱呆上三个月
Charges are filed, you get sent back to county for three months.

27:06.350 --> 27:09.000
回来的时候已经又多了10年刑期了
Come back here with 10 more years added to your bid.

27:09.140 --> 27:10.590
我不是想逃跑
I wasn't trying to escape.

27:10.870 --> 27:12.220
你当然不想
 Sure you weren't.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.130
你只是在那儿对着月亮凄叹
You were just out there howling at the moon.

27:20.060 --> 27:24.140
如果我是你 我就招供了 墨西哥佬
If I were you, I'd better start talking, mano.

27:26.790 --> 27:29.010
我今天一直呆在那院子里
I stayed out after yard today.

27:29.340 --> 27:31.770
我在露天看台地下呆到了天黑
I waited under the bleachers until it got dark.

27:31.930 --> 27:33.930
有人会从墙外面扔东西进来
Something was gonna come over the walls.

27:33.930 --> 27:35.740
吸毒和逃跑一样是重罪
Drugs is almost as bad as escape.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.670
上次有个家伙在墙边搞海洛因 被多加了5年徒刑
Last guy had heroin slingshot over the wall got a nickel added to his bid.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.760
我不是为了毒品
It wasn't drugs.

27:41.930 --> 27:43.800
那他妈的到底是什么?!
Then what the hell was it?

27:44.870 --> 27:45.870
搜身!
Frisk him!

27:54.430 --> 27:55.930
看我们找到了什么?
What do we have here?

28:04.500 --> 28:06.410
花内裤?
A pair of grunds?

28:07.110 --> 28:09.560
你冒着被关单独禁闭的危险去搞内裤?
You risked going to the SHU for a pair of grunds?

28:09.580 --> 28:12.490
妈的 你冒着被增加刑期的危险
Hell, you risked adding extra time to your bid,

28:12.580 --> 28:14.400
去搞内裤?
all for a pair of panties?

28:14.560 --> 28:17.710
我女友只是想让我知道 她在想我 老大
My girl just wanted me to know she was thinking about me, boss

28:20.150 --> 28:22.970
你的手真是不听使唤啊 不是么?
You got a real beefer on your hands, don't you?

28:23.100 --> 28:25.740
我知道 老大 这是我做过的最蠢的事
I know, boss. It's the dumbest thing I've ever done.

28:25.920 --> 28:30.000
我害怕我在这里呆得太久 她就不要我了
I'm just scared that being here, I'm gonna lose her.

28:30.570 --> 28:33.830
-他是为了爱情  -那么说你理解我了
-He did it for love.  -Then you understand.

28:34.950 --> 28:38.410
是啊 当然 苏克雷 我理解你
Yeah, sure, Sucre. I understand.

28:47.020 --> 28:49.690
你以后别栽到我手上
Don't let me catch you alone next time, okay?

28:52.550 --> 28:53.730
苏克雷!
Sucre!

28:54.570 --> 28:55.450
水缸?
Sink?

28:56.660 --> 28:57.600

32:44.510 --> 32:45.720

32:45.840 --> 32:47.710
我还以为我们选择 林肯·布伦斯作为替罪羊
I thought we picked Lincoln Burrows off the street

32:47.740 --> 32:50.040
是因为他是个无法保护自己的社会下层人士
because he was some lowlife who couldn't defend himself.

32:50.070 --> 32:51.610
现在我才发现 原来他父亲 
Now I learn it's all about his father,

32:51.640 --> 32:54.270

今天下午的参议院投票

33:47.940 --> 33:49.540
这个投票没关系
This isn't about a vote.

33:49.740 --> 33:52.580
这是有关你和你在选民心中印象的问题
This is about you and how you look to voters.

33:52.710 --> 33:56.500
现在 我们的国家变得日益需要多样化的能源
Now, we have a nation that is growing increasingly hungry for alternate energy.

33:56.530 --> 33:59.090
如果你这次再保持中立
So if you come across as more centrist,

33:59.170 --> 34:01.180
你就会获得更多人的支持
you'll appeal to the broader swath of the electorate,

34:01.210 --> 34:04.220
明年你就很可能当选
the very people who will get you elected next year.

34:07.450 --> 34:10.460
再说 一旦议案到了总统那儿 他一定一票否决
Besides, once that bill hits the President's desk, he'll veto it.

34:10.490 --> 34:14.030
那样 我们就得到我们所有想要的了
Then we'll get precisely what we always wanted anyway, won't we?

34:21.820 --> 34:26.480
你是不是连毛都没长全?
You probably don't have a hair on your body, do you?

34:27.110 --> 34:29.240
滚你的王八蛋
Just back your punk ass up.

34:30.190 --> 34:33.350
嘿 颓纳!快过来
Hey, Tweener! Get over here.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.600

Looks like Avocado has taken a shine to you.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.070

 I could set you up as cellies if you want.

34:49.210 --> 34:50.860

Stop it, all right?

34:51.940 --> 34:54.560
我这次探听到点消息
I got something for you this time.

34:54.720 --> 34:57.120
斯科菲尔德那帮家伙 他们在策划着什么事
Scofield and his boys, they're up to something.

34:57.210 --> 34:59.230
能不能具体一点?
How about being a little more specific?

35:00.340 --> 35:03.870
不管是什么 好像和他们修的那个房间有关...
Whatever it is, it's got to do with that room they're fixing.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.600
和那地毯有关
Something to do with the carpet.

35:29.270 --> 35:30.420

36:27.830 --> 36:29.870

Michael! Michael!

37:51.000 --> 37:53.950
完全没有反应 给他注射镇静剂
He's totally non-responsive, so start him on chlorpromazine.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.780
我觉得他有间歇精神病发作
And I believe he's in danger of a psychotic break.

37:55.810 --> 37:58.860
一旦他精神病发作 你就立马通知我
I want you to notify me immediately if and when that happens.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.000
把他清理干净
Clean him up.

39:13.510 --> 39:14.620

39:28.440 --> 39:30.930
LJ 解决问题有其它方法的 好吗?
LJ, there's other ways out of this, you know, okay?

39:30.960 --> 39:33.140
我可以帮助你的 但如果你扣下扳机
I can help you beat this rap, but if you pull that trigger,

39:33.170 --> 39:36.680
那你就真的成了杀人犯 我就帮不了你了 懂吗?
you really will be a killer, and then I can't help you, okay?

39:36.770 --> 39:39.150
我是政府部门的 LJ 我能帮你办到很多事
I'm government, LJ. There's a lot of things I can do for you.

39:39.180 --> 39:41.800
你能帮我的唯一一件事就是去死!
The only thing you can do for me is die!

39:42.000 --> 39:43.400

你废话一大堆 那边根本什么都没有
You brought me a pile of crap. There was nothing there.

40:15.550 --> 40:17.580

Boss, come on, man. I just need some more time.

40:17.610 --> 40:20.400
我已经给你时间了 你简直是在浪费我的时间
You had your time. You're a waste of my fries.

40:23.690 --> 40:25.130

40:28.780 --> 40:30.870
