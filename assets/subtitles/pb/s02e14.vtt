06:55.260 --> 07:00.180
你怎么不和其他"前狱警"在一起啊
Why don't you hang out with the rest of the ex-guards that are locked up here?

07:00.180 --> 07:02.050

07:02.050 --> 07:03.920
这里没有前狱警

我会罩着你  确保没人找你麻烦

08:45.530 --> 08:48.760
反过来你也应该原谅我

08:48.760 --> 08:50.200
原谅我的轻率
for my indiscretions,

08:50.200 --> 08:51.630

在黑人社区你不会丢下自己的孩子

跟一个白人私奔

你来福克斯河看我那次
When you came to Fox River,

09:32.130 --> 09:33.900
你很生气的向我吐口水
and you spat at me

09:33.900 --> 09:38.400
就好像我是一头...狂恶的畜牲
like I was some kind of. . . rabid animal. . .

09:41.560 --> 09:44.530
其实我很高兴
I was happy.

09:44.530 --> 09:47.030
因为这样的动作发自内心

09:47.030 --> 09:50.260
说明这个女人依然在意
from a woman who still cares.

09:51.630 --> 09:52.960
孩子们是一无所知的
The children don't know anything.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.930
我不愿让他们害怕 所以我从没告诉他们
The children don't know anything.I didn't want to scare them,

09:54.930 --> 09:56.330
关于你的事情 所以求你...
so I never told them about you,so please don'T.

09:56.330 --> 10:01.000
简直太完美了
That is so perfect.

10:02.200 --> 10:07.100

这些西装革履的人 像一群小男孩那样相互追逐
Bunch of little boys in suits running around,

10:24.830 --> 10:27.000
不惜彼此相互残杀
trying to kill each other.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.430
真是悲哀
It's pathetic.

10:28.430 --> 10:31.930
你比我们预想的要难对付一些
Well,you were a little more formidable than we anticipated.

10:31.930 --> 10:34.530
蠢货  我们不稀罕你的恭维
We don't need compliments out of you,jackass.

10:34.530 --> 10:36.530
是啊  看见了吗
Oh,yes,there it is,

10:36.530 --> 10:38.130

What the hell is going on out there?

10:52.860 --> 10:54.900
当时的情况一触即发
Well,it was touch-and-go there for a minute,

10:54.900 --> 10:56.530
不过我把一且都解决好了

10:56.530 --> 10:58.160

Maybe there won't be another accident

27:38.030 --> 27:42.430

28:05.860 --> 28:06.000

28:25.830 --> 28:27.200
指纹烧光了

DNA 跟那个我们杀掉
DNA.To compare against the homeless guy we killed

28:29.130 --> 28:30.800
并且放在斯蒂德曼车上的
homeless guy we killed and put in Steadman's car,

28:30.800 --> 28:32.260
流浪汉对比吗?
put in Steadman's car,

但是我们把所有的DNA采样都销毁了
but we destroyed all exterior dna samples,

28:34.460 --> 28:36.430
所以我们什么都没的对比了
so that there'd be nothing to compare them to.

28:36.430 --> 28:38.600
总能找到个人
There's gotta be someone somewhere

28:38.600 --> 28:39.960
出来指认他的

28:45.300 --> 28:47.960
没留什么足以辨认的特点给认识他的人
Not so much that someone who knew him wouldn't cognize him,

28:47.960 --> 28:49.800
但是足够让任何依法鉴定
but enough that any forensic comparison

出那张照片是一个
of a photograph

28:51.060 --> 28:52.800
跟他长相相似的人的

29:00.830 --> 29:02.230
求你们了放了我吧
Please just let me go.

29:02.230 --> 29:03.760
特伦斯

29:03.760 --> 29:05.160
你把这间屋子里每个人都变成犯人了
you've made every man in this room a prisoner,

29:05.160 --> 29:07.300
包括你自己

29:07.300 --> 29:09.360
现在是让我们自由的时候了

29:09.360 --> 29:11.460

Nothing you do will work.

29:11.460 --> 29:12.630
他们不会罢手的

29:12.630 --> 29:15.760

29:15.760 --> 29:16.830
他巴不得一边搜罗
He was more than happy to play along when he was lining

29:16.830 --> 29:18.000
贪污来的纳税人的钱
his pockets with taxpayer money

29:18.000 --> 29:20.100
一边自得其乐
funneled through ecofield.

29:20.100 --> 29:22.560
然后  当面临诉讼的时候
And then, when the indictment is about to fall,

29:22.560 --> 29:26.750
你准备找谁给你擦屁股
who do you come running to for help, Terrence?

29:29.360 --> 29:31.100
现在我们要在这里待上个一两天
now we are gonna stay here for a day or two,

29:31.100 --> 29:34.400
直到他们以为我们已经逃之夭夭...
until they think we're a thousand miles away.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.160
然后我们去华盛顿
and then we're gonna make our way to DC.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.160
好吗
Okay?

29:38.160 --> 29:40.130
这就是计划了
So that's the plan?

29:40.130 --> 29:43.530
我们把他带到一个满是敌人和FBI的地方去
We take him to a city crawling with company and feds?

29:43.530 --> 29:46.330
那些政府特工还在行动呢
And government agents, still in power,

29:46.330 --> 29:48.360
他们一直在内部帮你父亲做事
who've been working from the inside with your father,

29:48.360 --> 29:49.930
他们可以一直埋伏着
people who can get that this pain in the ass

29:49.930 --> 29:52.330
直到他把一切全招了
to safely tell his story, on the record.

29:52.330 --> 29:54.530
我们就直闯龙穴
And we just stroll right into the lion's den then, huh?

29:54.530 --> 29:55.960
并祈祷我们不被发现
Pray we don't get mauled.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.030
我不认为他们会回到蒙大拿
I don't think they're gonna come to montana,

29:58.030 --> 30:01.800
迈克尔 我们就最好去找他们
Scofield, so we're gonna go to them.

那我可真会感到惊...讶了
I'd be a-aized.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.030

印第安语里玉米就叫做 讶
Indian word for corn is maize

30:23.060 --> 30:25.630
我刚才说惊...讶
and I said "a-maized. "

30:25.630 --> 30:30.400
我不明白  我糊...涂了
I don't get it. I'm corn-fused.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.300

30:44.430 --> 30:49.130

I thought we had wiped the slate clean.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.130
求你了
Please.

30:58.130 --> 31:02.030
我以为过去的就过去了

在背叛我之后 在毁掉我们的一切之后
After turncoatin' me to the authorities,after ruinin' everything we had,

31:12.460 --> 31:14.360
在让我如此心碎之后

31:18.660 --> 31:21.200

31:25.030 --> 31:29.000
扎克 你给我坐在沙发上
ack, you get your ass back on that couch.

31:29.430 --> 31:32.630
快带格瑞西走 快走
Get Gracey! Go!

31:41.660 --> 31:44.360
我给了你们机会
I gave y'all a chance.

31:44.360 --> 31:47.960
记住了
Remember that.

32:12.230 --> 32:16.600
打开22号门
Open on 22.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.800
伙计 你一定是疯了
Dude, you're crazy

32:22.800 --> 32:24.460
是不是别人都在这么说
Is that what the other cons are saying?

32:24.460 --> 32:26.430
是的 不错
- Yeah.- Good.

32:26.430 --> 32:28.800
不过你惹了班克斯
But you took it to Banks?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.230
我想没人敢惹那家伙的
I don't think you want to be messing with him, man.

32:30.230 --> 32:31.660
凡是惹我的人
I'll mess with anybody who

32:31.660 --> 32:33.800
我都不会给他好果子吃
tries to punk me out.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.760
嘿 你知道么
Hey, you know

32:35.760 --> 32:37.630
我是在...试试你而已
Hey, you know

32:37.630 --> 32:40.630
好吧 那你现在知道结果了吧
Yeah, well, the test results came back.

32:40.630 --> 32:42.630
上铺的床位得让给我了
And top bunk's mine now.

32:42.630 --> 32:46.600
你有什么问题吗?
You got a problem with that?

32:55.600 --> 32:56.860
什么事 斯托勒
Hey, what's up, Stolte?

32:56.860 --> 32:58.960
你惹祸 光头 惹大祸了
You screwed up, Brad, big-time.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.760
不 我只是宣布了一些事情
No, I had a message to send,

33:00.760 --> 33:02.500
我必须这样
and that message got delivered.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.830
你揍的那家伙 班克斯
The guy you schlocked-- Banks--

33:04.830 --> 33:08.400
他和值夜班的警卫有关系
he's got connections with the guards working nights.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.500
也就是说
Word is,

33:09.500 --> 33:13.030
班克斯今晚要把你从里面拖出来
Banks is gonna have you pulled out of your cell tonight.

33:13.030 --> 33:14.500
那你能不能帮我下
Well, can't you do nothing?

33:14.500 --> 33:17.230
我能先警告你下
Yeah, I can warn you,

33:17.230 --> 33:18.400
我现在正在帮你呢
which is what I'm doing.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.460
那 你能否
Well, can't you

33:19.460 --> 33:20.960
跟值夜班的兄弟去说说
talk to some of the guys working nights?

33:20.960 --> 33:23.700
他们值夜班就是因为你让他们值的
They're working nights 'cause you put them on nights.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.760
你之前真应该对他们好点
You should've treated the men better when you were here.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.800
他们不会帮你的 大光头
They ain't gonna do you any favors, Brad.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.230
我对你不错 不是吗
I treated you right, didn't I?

33:30.230 --> 33:32.000
帮帮忙吧 斯拖勒
Come on, Stolte.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.800
帮我一把吧 求你了
Please?

33:33.800 --> 33:36.560
你是对我不错
You did treat me right,

33:36.560 --> 33:38.830
但我现在也无能为力
but there is nothing I can do

33:38.830 --> 33:41.100
只能先通知你下
now except warn you.

33:41.100 --> 33:45.030
小心点吧
Watch your back.

33:51.160 --> 33:55.400
我们可以利用国家冰河公园里巡逻员用的消防通道
we can use the fire roads that the park rangers use in Glacier National Park.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.860
夜间他们不巡逻
They don't patrol them at night.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.500
然后我们从加拿大一直往东
We get up into canada, we head east,

33:58.500 --> 33:59.900
经过纽约
we cut down through new york.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.230
穿过边界不会遇到麻烦吗
The borders won't be a problem.

34:02.230 --> 34:04.460
别告诉我没人会理睬我们
No, nobody will look for us there.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.630
真的很好笑吗 特伦斯
this is.fun for you, Terrence, really?

34:06.630 --> 34:08.600
不 不 这不好笑
fun for you, Terrence, really?

34:08.600 --> 34:10.860
好笑的是当时我和凯若琳在谈论你
What was fun was when Caroline and I would talk about you,

34:10.860 --> 34:13.230
某个男生迷恋她
and the schoolboy crush that you had on her.

34:13.230 --> 34:17.600
还向她求婚
He proposed to her.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.160
你还以为你能成为 第一先生（女总统的丈夫）
you actually thought that you would be the first husband,

34:20.160 --> 34:23.700
奴隶也能当国王啊
the serf who would be king?

34:23.700 --> 34:27.530
那可真有趣啊...
we laughed so hard.

34:28.030 --> 34:29.660
你站那儿看着他们杀了维罗妮卡
you stood there and watched them kill Veronica!

34:29.660 --> 34:32.300
-布伦斯-而你什么都没做
-Burrows!-And you did nothing!

34:32.300 --> 34:35.300
她因你而死
She died because of you!

34:44.500 --> 34:49.800
-林肯-杀了他毫无意义 他没身份记录 杀了也仅是约翰 邓
Burrows, he has no value to us dead.He has no identity.You kill him, you have just a John Doe.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.100
-放下枪-林肯 我们就快成功了
Just put your gun down.Just put your gun down.
Lincoln We fast success.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
值得的 他害死那么多人 还毁了我的生活
Was it worth it?Killing those people, ruining my life?

34:57.200 --> 35:01.000
－我能处理的－闭嘴 没用的 林肯 你不应该这样做
Scofield, get a handle on your brother.Shut up. You're not helping. You're not helping.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.070
相信我 这不是你想要的
Linc, you don't want to do this.

35:02.070 --> 35:03.140
相信我
Trust me.

35:03.900 --> 35:04.900
这就是他想要的
This is what you want

35:06.030 --> 35:07.140
你不应该这么做的
You don't want to do this.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.800
好吗
Okay?

35:08.800 --> 35:11.770
相信我
Trust me.

35:26.840 --> 35:31.270
死了这么多人
So many people dead.

35:31.340 --> 35:34.400
他却还活着
And he gets to live.

35:38.070 --> 35:40.300
喂 喂
Hello. Hello.

35:40.300 --> 35:41.900
他们拒绝保释
They denied bail.

35:41.900 --> 35:42.970
什么
What?

35:42.970 --> 35:44.700
由于你 法官不买帐
Judge didn't buy that it was all you.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.500
马上要立案了
Judge didn't buy that it was all you.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.240
逃跑罪
Aiding an escaped con.

35:48.240 --> 35:51.400
她是成年人了 伙计
She's looking at major time, man.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.400
好吧 那...
All right

35:56.200 --> 35:59.500
呃...
uh.

35:59.870 --> 36:01.670
我要你转告她律师...
I want you to tell her lawyer--

36:01.670 --> 36:02.870
行么 你听我说...
all right,you listen to me--

36:02.870 --> 36:07.040
你告诉她律师...
you tell her lawyer.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.840
我爱你
I love you.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.440
和她律师说我会去自首 好么
Tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in, okay?

36:12.440 --> 36:13.940
不 凯西说你快逃吧
No. Kacee said you need to run.

36:13.940 --> 36:15.600
如果你去自首了
If you get busted or turn yourself in,

36:15.600 --> 36:16.900
迪迪就失去你们两个了
Dede won't have either of you.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.440
他们会把她扔进看护所
And they'll just throw her into foster care.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.370
听着 伙计 我要挂电话了
Look, man, I'm gonna hang up this phone right now,

36:21.370 --> 36:24.000
因为我怕说出些让我自己后悔的话
'cause I feel I might say something I regret.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.440
你...
Yo.

36:26.440 --> 36:30.500
你照顾好迪迪
you just take care of Dede.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.700
你们知道吗... 在我小时候
you know that.my daddy wasn't really in the picture

36:44.700 --> 36:45.870
父亲对我影响真的不是很深
much when I was growing up.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.940
所以呢
So as a result,

36:47.940 --> 36:51.940
我真的做不了一个好木匠
I never really learned the art of carpentry.

36:51.940 --> 36:54.300
不过我猜 上帝是个好木匠
But I figure, jesus was a carpenter,

36:54.300 --> 36:56.240
他老爹也没怎么教他
and his daddy wasn't around to teach him,

36:56.240 --> 36:59.900
所以我就自学成才了
so I taught myself.

37:00.070 --> 37:05.700
一直以来 我都非常善于用锤子
Over time, I got to be a pretty good swinger of the hammer.

37:05.900 --> 37:09.040
现在呢 好消息是 我不像我老爹
now, the good news is,unlike my papa

37:09.040 --> 37:15.000
也不像上帝他老爹  我会一直在这陪你们的
and the great almighty,I'm here for good.

37:15.100 --> 37:18.900
别误会
Don't make no mistake about it.

37:19.300 --> 37:21.670
我们会成为一家人...
We will be a family.

37:21.670 --> 37:26.640
死也要在一起
if it kills us.

37:43.340 --> 37:48.100
真甜蜜
So sweet.

37:52.470 --> 37:54.770
车子在前面了
car's out front.

让我们整理下出发吧
Let's get covered up and move out.

37:56.070 --> 37:58.070
这两人好像水火不容
These two are never gonna make it in a car together.

37:58.070 --> 37:59.700
你得看好你兄弟
You're gonna have to keep your brother in check.

37:59.700 --> 38:00.640
你不了解他
You don't know him.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.540
那就从他那把我的枪拿过来
Then get my gun from him.

38:02.540 --> 38:03.840
我们没多少时间了
We don't have time for this.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.270

你已经在监狱里了 特伦斯
Disgrace, life in prison?

就为了你能安全地待在林子的小木屋里
How many more people have to die
