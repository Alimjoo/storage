他的钱藏在了犹他
The money's in Utah,

00:31.860 --> 00:33.190

你是其中的一个 福克斯河 的逃犯
You're one of them Fox River boys.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.120
没有  让人捷足先登了
No.   Somee else does.

00:48.130 --> 00:49.320
在我毁掉他之前
Before I destroyed it,

00:49.330 --> 00:51.950
我已经记在我脑子里了
I committed it to my photographic memory.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.750

上面重新建造过了
The bastards built over it.

01:08.330 --> 01:11.930
完了
It's gone.

02:21.830 --> 02:23.920
我们还有15分钟就要开门了
we have to open up in 15 minutes.

02:23.930 --> 02:24.890
那不要紧
So, it doesn't matter.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.090
快来吧 我说过了  不
I dare you.I said...I said no.

02:27.100 --> 02:32.300
快来吧  求你了

03:04.260 --> 03:07.150
那个农场没了  迈克尔
The ranch is gone, Michael.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.600
是的  五百万可能还在
Well, the five million might not be.

03:09.730 --> 03:12.300
那你打算怎么找那些钱
And you gonna find it how?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.620
难道你纹了个探测器在你屁股上?
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?

03:14.630 --> 03:15.920
我不想听从你嘴里
I don't want to hear

03:15.930 --> 03:17.050
说出的任何话
anything out of your mouth

03:17.060 --> 03:20.890
除了你对地图的记忆，也把地图上的东西都给我说出来
other than what your photographic memory spits out regarding that map.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.920
你要注意你和我说话的语气  小子
You watch your tone with me, boy.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.920
我只会看着你被扔到
I will watch you get tossed

03:24.930 --> 03:27.890
马路上自生自灭  小子
to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.520
因为如果你想不起来那个地窖在哪
Because if you can't remember where that silo was,

03:30.530 --> 03:31.990
你对我们来说就是个废物
you're worthless to us.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.150
嗨  让我出去!
Yo, let me out!

03:34.160 --> 03:35.020

03:37.460 --> 03:39.790
好  好  好的
Okay, okay, all right, all right, all right

03:39.800 --> 03:40.950
那个农场... 那个农场
the ranch...the ranch was

03:40.960 --> 03:44.590
在一个方形区域当中  一边是雪普路
the ranch was in the center of a box--sheep road on one side,

03:44.600 --> 03:46.390
和可可辛路垂直交叉
kokosing road perpendicular.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.620
藏钱地的中心点
In the center of the property

03:47.630 --> 03:50.090
就是农场的房子
was the ranch house.

03:50.100 --> 03:55.860
房子的四周都是树
And the ranch house was surrounded by trees.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.950
这些树最多只种了一年
Every tree here is a year old at most.

04:07.960 --> 04:12.100
除了那些
Except those.

04:13.030 --> 04:16.790
地窖在哪?
Where is the silo?

04:16.800 --> 04:20.020
在...在树林里面
In...side the trees.

04:20.030 --> 04:22.790
我想可能是靠左边
I want to say on the left,

04:22.800 --> 04:25.990
但是  那应该有个谷仓啊
but that m have been a barn.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.920
我把能记住的都说了  伙计
I remembered the best I could, gents,

04:27.930 --> 04:29.720
但是没想到这个地方
but I didn't know this place

04:29.730 --> 04:32.020
现在盖了这么多房子在上面
would now be smothered in tract homes,

04:32.030 --> 04:35.200
所以  你知道我也没办法 但我并不是废物
so, you know,I'm sorry that I-I'm not rainman over here.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.100
我是马宏 你好!
Alex Mahone,How are you!

04:40.200 --> 04:41.390

谢谢  我需要的那些文件弄到了吗
Thank you.Do you have those files my office requested

04:50.700 --> 04:51.990
关于D.B. 库珀那个案子的
on the D.B. Cooper case?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.390
我们正在提取
We're pulling them now.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.220
- 就是那个30年前D.B. 库珀的案子吗? - 是的
- And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?- Correct.

04:56.230 --> 04:57.450
如果我能立即拿到那些文件
If I can get those files immediately,

04:57.460 --> 04:59.250
我会很感谢
I'd appreciate it.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.650
嗨  对不起  但我想问一下
Hey, sorry, but I have to ask.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.250
你不是为了福克斯河的八个逃犯来的吗?
Aren't you here for the Fox River eight?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.650
是的  而且他们就在犹他州
I am, and they're here in Utah

05:04.660 --> 05:08.750
为了D.B. 库珀的钱  那些文件怎么样了  莱尔?
to get D.B.Cooper's money,so how abouthose files, Lyle?

05:08.760 --> 05:10.550
地窖
Silo.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.350
地窖  地窖  地窖  地窖
Silo, silo, silo, silo.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.820
真是太蠢了
This is stupid.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.450
我们要把这个地方找出来
We're going to get made out here.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.290
啊  闭嘴  我想我记起来了
Ah, shut it.I think I remember.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.390
如果打赌的话  我敢很确定
If I had to bet, I'd lay

05:21.400 --> 05:24.020
地窖就在那个平房的左侧
it all on the silo being on the left of the ranch house

05:24.030 --> 05:25.950
在树林里面
inside the trees.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.750
不  是在树林外
No.It's outside the trees.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.290
在那
Right there.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.990
看见那两棵树了吗?
You see those two trees?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.790
它们比其他的都矮
They're shorter than the rest.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.850
它们都是在同一个时间种下的
They were all planted at the same time,

05:36.860 --> 05:39.050
但是那两棵树没有得到充足的阳光
but those two didn't get as much sunlight.

05:39.060 --> 05:40.850
有东西挡着它们
Something was in their way.

05:40.860 --> 05:43.520
地窖
The silo.

05:43.530 --> 05:46.420
我们的钱应该就在那间车库下面
Our money should be right there under that garage.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.250
你最好没猜错  小子
You better be right, boy.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.420
这不是一个重要的小镇
This isn't a high-end subdivision.

05:50.430 --> 05:52.550
他们马马虎虎很快造好了这个地方
They slapped this place up overnight.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.920
地窖的地基有可能还在那
The silo's foundation might still be there.

05:54.930 --> 05:57.020
为了省钱  他们可能就用混凝土
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete

05:57.030 --> 05:59.150
浇铸车库的地面就在地窖的上面
for the garage floor right on top of it.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.320
我们只要一直往下挖
We'll dig straight down.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.190
如果我们碰到地基的话就留下
If we hit the foundation, we stay.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.220
如果没有  我们就走人
But if not, we go.

06:04.230 --> 06:08.700
现在就开始吧
Let's do it.

06:08.830 --> 06:12.420
哦  妈的
Oh, man.

06:12.430 --> 06:15.730
哦  哦

06:19.400 --> 06:21.020
没问题  用把螺丝刀
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver

06:21.030 --> 06:23.100
在她太阳穴上开个洞就搞定了
to her temple won't fix.

07:04.330 --> 07:06.390
人总有一死  小子
people die all the time, boys.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.650
但五百万这一辈子可只有这一次
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.320
让我出去!
Let me out!

07:11.330 --> 07:13.290
好的  我们要做点什么
Well, we got to do something

07:13.300 --> 07:17.700
这次不要伤害任何人
and it's not going to involve hurting anyone.

07:21.130 --> 07:22.750
我有个主意
I got an idea.

07:22.760 --> 07:27.000
首先  我们需要一些装备
First, we're going to need some supplies.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.750
110%不同意
110% do not agree with this.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.350
每个人为了拿到钱都会竭尽全力
Everybody's got to pitch in to make this happen.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.250
但在监狱里
But back in the big house,

07:50.260 --> 07:52.050
那小子就被证实他不可靠
the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.

07:52.060 --> 07:53.450
所以我们才开车到这个地方
Which is why we're doing it here.

07:53.460 --> 07:54.550
如果他在镇上被捕
If he gets caught in town,

07:54.560 --> 07:57.090
他不会知道房子的具体位置
he ain't got a clue where the house is.

07:57.100 --> 08:02.100
另外  我们也不完全相信你
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.050
哦

08:07.060 --> 08:10.850
你知道吗   我在里面可能会憋死  老兄
You know, I could have died in there, man.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.620
嗯  你猜怎么着?
Well, guess what?

08:12.630 --> 08:14.650
我们需要你去做些事情
We need you to do something.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.690
我需要你为我做些事
I need you to do something for me.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.420
我想得到我那部分钱
I want my cut of the money.

08:18.430 --> 08:21.320
好的   等你证明我们可以相信你我们再谈
Well, we'll talk once you prove we can trust you.

08:21.330 --> 08:24.090
我去做什么
What do I got to do?

08:24.100 --> 08:26.750
回那个花卉店把这单字上写的东西拿来
I want you to go back to that garden center and get everything on this list.

08:26.760 --> 08:30.750
然后把车加满油
Then gas up the car.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.150
我们一个小时后在这里见面
And we'll meet you right back here in an hour.

08:34.160 --> 08:37.320
好的
All right.

08:37.330 --> 08:40.590
还有  大卫...
And David...

08:40.600 --> 08:43.620
别把这事搞砸了
don't screw this up.

08:43.630 --> 08:47.790
这里不再是福克斯河了  老兄
This ain't Fox River no more, man.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.990
这次才是真正的交易
You're looking at the real deal now.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.260
但我要我那部分钱
But I want my cut.

08:56.030 --> 09:00.430
一小时后我会回来的
I'll be back in an hour.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.950
我们走
Let's go.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.320
错误
Mistake.

09:08.330 --> 09:12.960
严重的错误
Big mistake.

10:09.830 --> 10:11.650
看到你真高兴啊
am I glad to see you.

10:11.660 --> 10:14.790
你走到这的?
Did you walk here?

10:14.800 --> 10:16.650
哦 不... 是...
Well, no...it's...

10:16.660 --> 10:18.550
说来话长啊  伙计
it's-it's just a long story, man.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.320
还以为你和你家人在一起了呢
Thought you were meeting up with your family.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.350
我碰到了... 碰到了点麻烦
I met a...I met a few roadblocks.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.490
你呢?
You?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.490
是的
Yeah.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.490
让我猜猜看... 你打算去图勒镇?
Let me guess...you're going to Tooele.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.990
是的
Yep.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.950
我们似乎都往同一个地方去啊
it looks like we're going in the same direction.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.190
希望不会太迟
Hopefully we're not too late.

10:38.200 --> 10:42.220
能搭个车吗?
Can I hitch a ride?

10:42.230 --> 10:45.530
嘿...
Hey...

10:46.930 --> 10:50.830
我会让你觉得是值得的
I'll make it worth your while.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.450

10:56.000 --> 10:59.650
在威斯康星州思达 格鲁夫的一家快餐店
Spotted at a burger joint in cedar grove, Wisconsin.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.690
马上交给当地警方办吧
Just hand it over to local authorities for now.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.520
我们今天就处理犹他州的事
The only thing we're working today is Utah

11:03.530 --> 11:04.590
还有D.B. 库珀这事
and D.B. Cooper.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.190
明白了
Got it.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.590

11:09.600 --> 11:11.490
在这个单子上有个人
Therers a guy here listed

11:11.500 --> 11:13.720
是我们找到唯一一个 收到过D.B. 库珀的钱的人哈罗德 詹金斯
as having the only D.B. Cooper bill ever found in circulation, Harold Jenkins.

11:13.730 --> 11:16.290
是的 D.B.库珀从詹金斯那里买过汽油
Yeah, D.B. Bought gas from jenkins

11:16.300 --> 11:18.590
在劫机那天用百元大钞买的

我们查过了序列号
We checked the serial numbers

11:20.000 --> 11:21.420
是吻合的
and they matched.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.820
你是负责这案子的?
You worked the case?

11:23.830 --> 11:25.450
新人刚毕业时
Fresh out of the academy.

11:25.460 --> 11:27.020
一直都没人能弄清楚这事
And nobody's cracked it yet.

11:27.030 --> 11:28.590
为什么你认为
What makes you think

11:28.600 --> 11:30.890
那些逃犯知道钱在哪?
that these escapees know where the money is?

11:30.900 --> 11:32.320
因为他们很可能是和
Because they may have been

11:32.330 --> 11:33.490
真正的D.B. 库珀关在一起的
locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.690
这个加油站的詹金斯
This Jenkins from the gas station,

11:34.700 --> 11:36.220

12:14.900 --> 12:17.350

I'm assuming why you're here

12:39.300 --> 12:40.690
呃  是的
Yes, um,

斯科菲尔德给她寄了邮件留了信息
Scofield sent her a message through the mail

12:43.830 --> 12:48.850
可那个电话号码打不通
that phone number that was disconnected.

12:48.860 --> 12:50.320
你知道  说实话
You know, to be honest,

12:50.330 --> 12:55.620
我想和总统做个简报
I was expecting to brief the president.

12:55.630 --> 12:57.990
呃  关于这个...
Yeah, about that,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.420
现在  你也知道  凯若琳非常忙
right now,as you can imagine, Caroline's quite busy.

13:02.430 --> 13:03.790
她一直都很忙
She's always been busy.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.850
我和她共事了15年
I've been working side-by-side with her for 15 years.

13:05.860 --> 13:08.950
保罗  她现在是美国总统了
Paul, she's the President of the United States now.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.490
是的  比尔  我帮她坐上这个位子
Yes, Bill, and I helped put her there.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.720
如果你还想她继续做下去
if you'd like for her to remain in office,

13:14.730 --> 13:15.890
你最好接受我的建议
you'll take my advice

13:15.900 --> 13:17.820
从现在开始离她远点
and just stay on the sidelines for now.

13:17.830 --> 13:21.520
她必须完全隔绝
She needs to be completely insulated

13:21.530 --> 13:26.690
任何和与林肯 布伦斯有关的事情
from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows

13:26.700 --> 13:30.730
我想和她谈谈
I want to talk to her.

13:31.330 --> 13:34.620
你现在只向我汇报  只有我
You report to me now, and only me.

13:34.630 --> 13:35.790
没有我的允许
without my approval,

13:35.800 --> 13:37.420
你不用再联系凯若琳
You're not to try and contact Caroline again

13:37.430 --> 13:42.800
未经通知你也不要在这出现
and you don't show up here unannounced.

13:42.830 --> 13:46.620
完成你的工作  抓到布伦斯
Finish the job you were given; get Burrows.

13:46.630 --> 13:49.690
如果你要说通过唐克雷蒂 莎拉可以抓到他
If you're telling me the road to him leads through Sara Tancredi,

13:49.700 --> 13:53.690
那就想尽一切办法去追查
by all means, pursue it.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.850
一旦这事完成了
And once that's been accomplished

13:54.860 --> 13:56.550
一切都结束了后
and this whole thing goes away,

13:56.560 --> 14:02.760
那时我们会考虑让你再回到凯若琳的身边
we'll go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.

14:03.460 --> 14:05.820
现在还有关于莎拉的其他消息吗?
Now do you have anything else on Ssara?

14:05.830 --> 14:08.850
总统是坚定不移地信任你
The President has unwavering faith in you.

14:08.860 --> 14:10.390
她希望你确保能够
Wants to make sure you

14:10.400 --> 14:12.220
通过参议院的正式批准
go through the Senate approval process with your eyes wide open.

14:12.230 --> 14:13.420
那么我们现在要应对什么?
So what are we up against?

14:13.430 --> 14:15.050
参议院和众议院的一些主要同盟者
Key allies in the House and Senate are

14:15.060 --> 14:17.650
梅耶霍夫 巴恩维尔还有萨默维尔
Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Summerville.

14:17.660 --> 14:18.650
我们要靠他们
We're counting on them

14:18.660 --> 14:19.620
去拉拢那些中立派
to sway the middle.

14:19.630 --> 14:20.650
那谁是我们的对手?
But who's the opposition?

14:20.660 --> 14:23.020
议员布拉克和奇乐
Senators Blake and Killoren

14:23.030 --> 14:24.550
他们公开表示反对你当选副总统
have openly vocalized their opposition to you as VP.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.290
知道为什么吗?
Any indications to why?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.090
政治上的反击吧
Political payback

14:29.100 --> 14:30.550
因为上个月总统通过了能源法案
for the President's vote on the energy bill last month.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.450
我们要出其不意
Took them by surprise

14:32.460 --> 14:35.830
他们不喜欢意外
and they don't like surprises.

14:39.030 --> 14:40.650
兰斯  这是我爸爸弗兰克
Lance, this is,my father Frank.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.420
很高兴见到你  先生
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

14:42.430 --> 14:43.790
没什么大不了的
It's nothing to lose sleep over.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.550
说实话  最大的问题
Frankly, the biggest issue

14:45.560 --> 14:48.290
是我们要集中精力对付
we have to address are

14:48.300 --> 14:50.450
对你女儿的指控
the charges facing your daughter.

14:50.460 --> 14:53.050
市长  你在听我讲吗?
Governor, are you with me?

14:53.060 --> 14:56.660
当然是
Absolutely.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.990
别吵了 混蛋
no, just chill, dawg.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.650
听着  我们一离开  一出城
Listen, once we ro out, we bounce out of town,

15:14.660 --> 15:16.590
我们会留下信息 然后他们会找到你的
we'll drop a dime and they will find you.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.720
安静点
Just be quiet.

15:18.730 --> 15:22.730
再忍忍吧  伙计
Just chill, man.

15:24.130 --> 15:28.360
我要杀了你
I'm gonna kill you!

15:35.900 --> 15:39.400
伍迪?
Woody?

15:39.500 --> 15:41.520
你在哪?
Where you at?

15:41.530 --> 15:44.700
伍迪?
Woody?

15:58.730 --> 16:01.320
我要找威廉姆斯警长
I need Sheriff Williams.

16:01.330 --> 16:05.900
是的  我在
Yeah, I'll hold.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.660
伍迪?
Woody?

16:29.060 --> 16:30.590
你在哪学的电工?
When'd you learn about electricity?

16:30.600 --> 16:33.150
我过去常常从配电箱偷铜线
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.790
然后在码头那边卖掉  赚点钱
Sell 'em on the docks, make a few bucks.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.700
当然了  那时你还在读书
When you were at school, of course.

16:47.800 --> 16:51.090
我只是看看  帅哥
I was just looking, pretty.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.520
有个老掉牙的笑话怎么说来着?
What's that old chestnut?

16:52.530 --> 16:54.420
我看看菜单
I can look at the menu.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.790
并不意味着我想吃
Doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.500
我们进去  拿到钱 然后出来  仅此而已
We get in, we get the money, we get out.That's it.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.960
那当然了
No, absolutely.

17:11.760 --> 17:15.130
行了
We're good.

17:16.360 --> 17:20.730
现在就看那小子的了
Now it's just up to the kid.

17:23.800 --> 17:24.950
东西都拿齐了吗?
Did you get everything?

17:24.960 --> 17:29.230
是的  是的  拿到了
Yeah.Yeah, I got it.

17:47.330 --> 17:48.390
出什么事了?
What?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.820
没事  冷静  我处理好了
Nothing.It's cool.I handled it.

17:49.830 --> 17:52.990
出了什么事?!
What?!

17:53.000 --> 17:54.750
好吧
Okay.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.490
看吧是这样
Check it.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.990
刚才有个笨蛋进了店里
This fool came in the shop.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.020
他悄悄溜进来的
He was acting all shady.

17:59.030 --> 18:00.850
他发现有点不对劲  所以就拿起了电话
He got a bad vibe, so he picked up his celly phone,

18:00.860 --> 18:03.050
他开始打电话  然后我就打晕了他
he started to make a call, so I popped him.

18:03.060 --> 18:04.050
你做了什么?!
You did what?!

18:04.060 --> 18:05.820
我用铁铲打晕了他  伙计!
I hit him with a shovel, man!

18:05.830 --> 18:07.990
我不知道该怎么办!
I didn't know what else to do!

18:08.000 --> 18:11.150
然后我就把他绑了起来放在里屋
So I just, I tied him up and in put him in the back room

18:11.160 --> 18:12.290
和另外那个乡巴佬一起
with that other country hick.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.650
这下好了  这下好了
Here we go.Here we go.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.090
我还是脱险了  你个变态!
I came through you gimp!

18:16.100 --> 18:17.090
他打电话给谁了?
Who was he calling?

18:17.100 --> 18:19.020
县治安官
The sheriff.

18:19.030 --> 18:21.950
伙计  伙计  我真的不知道
Man, man, I-I don't know, dude.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.320
真的事发突然...  电话有没有打通?!
It just, it set off...did the call go through?!

18:24.330 --> 18:26.820
- 也许  伙计...  - 也许是什么意思? 到底有没有打通?!
- Maybe, man...-what do you mean, maybe?Did the call go through?!

18:26.830 --> 18:29.350
是的  不  我不知道
Yes.No, I don't know!

18:29.360 --> 18:32.500
我真的不知道  伙计
I don't know, man.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.790
但我拿到了工具
but I got the gear.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.190
我们现在得赶紧行动了
We got to move on this now.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.250
谁啊?
yes?

18:40.260 --> 18:42.590
很抱歉打扰你  太太
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.820
你家是不是断电了?
Is your electricity out?

18:44.830 --> 18:47.420
打扰下  我要找一个叫 哈罗德 詹金斯 的人
Excuse me.I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.420
在这
Right here.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.390
亚历山大 马宏  联邦探员
Alexander Mahone, FBI.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.520
我一直待在她50英尺以外
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.

18:54.530 --> 18:56.750
她该死的到底还想怎么样?
What the hell else does she want?

18:56.760 --> 18:58.690
我来这不是为这个的
I'm not here about that.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.690
那是为了什么?
What are you here for?

19:00.700 --> 19:01.990
D.B. 库珀
D.B. Cooper.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.550
大家还想要知道那家伙的事啊?
People still want to know about that guy?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.320
真是难以置信
Unbelievable.

19:06.330 --> 19:08.450
你以前在美国福克加油站工作的
You worked the gas station in American Fork

19:08.460 --> 19:09.590
那个他加油的地方
where he filled up.

19:09.600 --> 19:13.190
是的  那家伙看上去很普通
Yeah.Normal-looking guy.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.350
没说几句话
Barely said a word.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.450
你的陈述里有些矛盾
There were some discrepancies

19:16.460 --> 19:17.590
你30年前填的那个
in the statement you filed 30 years ago.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.920
在报告里  记录着
In the report, it's noted

19:18.930 --> 19:21.920
你说他早上7点来加的油
that you said he filled up at 7:00 A.M.

19:21.930 --> 19:25.490
但在后来你又说是晚上7点
But on another occasion,you said it was 7:00 P.M.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.920
到底那个是真的?
Which was it?

19:26.930 --> 19:29.120
两个都是
Both.

19:29.130 --> 19:31.250
他加了两次油?
He gassed up twice?

19:31.260 --> 19:33.120
是的
Yeah.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.450
两次都是加满的?
Full tanks both times?

19:35.460 --> 19:37.020
是的
Yeah.

19:37.030 --> 19:38.950
为什么这么问?
Why?

19:38.960 --> 19:40.950
一个系统什么?
A systems what?

19:40.960 --> 19:43.950
一次系统诊断测试
It's a systems diagnostics test.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.190
探测显示了
Footage from our gopher cam picked up　exactly

19:45.200 --> 19:47.090
你的电线
where your line

19:47.100 --> 19:48.420
腐烂的准确位置
was corrupted.

19:48.430 --> 19:51.720
那是谁让它烂掉的  你们这些人吗?
And who corrupted it, you guys?

19:51.730 --> 19:52.990
也许
Maybe.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.650
我所知道的就是我的上级打电话来说
All I know is my supervisor called and said　he

19:55.660 --> 19:57.250
让我和我的同事来这里
wants me and my crew to get over here

19:57.260 --> 19:59.350
以最快的速度解决这个问题
and fix that problem double-quick, double-time.

19:59.360 --> 20:05.220
那... 你不是电力公司的?
So...you're not with the electric company?

20:05.230 --> 20:06.290
是的  太太
No, ma'am.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.190
当然你也完全可以打电话给电力公司
Now feel free to call your company,

20:08.200 --> 20:10.090
但是我要告诉你  他们会做的就是
but I should tell you, all they'll do

20:10.100 --> 20:12.790
派来些技术人员   如果你够幸运的话或许是明天
is send over some tech,maybe tomorrow if you're lucky.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.490
然后他会花一整天来找到问题
And he'll spend a whole day trying to find the problem

20:16.500 --> 20:18.420
之后再花一天时间来修好它
and another day trying to fix it.

20:18.430 --> 20:20.020
但我们现在就在这
But we're here right now

20:20.030 --> 20:23.950
我们马上就能使你喝到冰果汁
we're ready to turn your juice back on.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.820
果汁?
My juice?

20:26.830 --> 20:29.020
是的
That's right.

20:29.030 --> 20:32.120
那么  呃...
And, uh...

20:32.130 --> 20:38.760
那是你的人?
and that's your crew?

20:39.400 --> 20:42.190
是的  太太
Yes, ma'am.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.690
是的 丹尼尔.库博那时开的是一辆 1965年的雪威.诺瓦（雪佛莱汽车的一种型号）
Yeah, D.B.Cooper was driving a 1965 Chevy Nova.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.950
没有文档纪录说库博自己有车
There's no record on file that cooper even had a car.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.390
但查尔斯.韦斯特莫兰德有
But charles westmoreland did,

20:50.400 --> 20:52.390
他那个时候已经登记了
nd the car registered to him at the time

20:52.400 --> 20:55.550
是一辆1965年16加仑油箱的雪威.诺瓦
was a 1965 Chevy Nova with a 16-gallon gas tank.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.850
你知道  那个时候  这种型号的雪威
Back then, a chevy that size probably got what,

20:57.860 --> 20:59.350
用一加仑的油能跑上8英里?
eight miles to the gallon?

20:59.360 --> 21:01.950
现在库博开的那辆福特 正停在美国福克加油站
Now, D.B. Stopped at the station in american fork,

21:01.960 --> 21:04.720
不久前刚加了一次油   然后当天晚上又回来
gassed up once early that day and then came back later

21:04.730 --> 21:06.620
再加一次
that same night and gassed up again.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.720
现在  为什么一个要去墨西哥的人
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico,

21:08.730 --> 21:11.320
要24小时不停地绕一个大圈
which is a straight shot south,

21:11.330 --> 21:12.350
而不从大路直走
drive off the main road for an all-day detour?

21:12.360 --> 21:13.620
为了那钱
The money.

21:13.630 --> 21:16.920
对了  库博也就是韦斯特莫兰德跳下飞机时
Exactly.Cooper/westmoreland jumped out of a plane

21:16.930 --> 21:18.650
带着500万
with $5 million.

21:18.660 --> 21:21.950
但韦斯特莫兰德被捕的时候
when he was arrested.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.190
并没有发现那笔钱
But westmoreland didn't have the money on him

21:23.200 --> 21:25.350
他在被逮捕前就已经把钱给藏好了
He ditched it before he got caught.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.850
给我那支奇异笔
Give me that magic marker.

21:26.860 --> 21:28.850
从美国福克加油站开出   他不可能开得很远
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone　further

21:28.860 --> 21:30.850
不可能超出64英里的范围
than 64 miles in any direction.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.220
我要知道那个周长范围内 你得到的一切情况
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.

21:32.230 --> 21:34.390
那些罪犯就在其中的一个镇里
Those cons are in one of these towns,

21:34.400 --> 21:37.120
要是少了其中一个人
and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them,

21:37.130 --> 21:40.700
我要你马上通知我
I want to know about it.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.490
那根出了问题的电缆就在你的车库下面
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.

21:43.500 --> 21:48.700
我们得挖开地板才能找到
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.050
好吧  那谁来付这些钱
Well, who's gonna pay for this

21:52.060 --> 21:53.850
还有谁来负责清洁和重修这地方呢?
and what about the cleanup and the repair?

21:53.860 --> 21:57.090
放心吧  公司会负责这一切费用
Well, the company will cover all costs.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.590
我们只是挖出一条小槽
We'll just dig a small trench,

21:58.600 --> 22:00.520
等把电缆给修好了  我们会铺上水泥
once we're finished, we'll re-lay the cement.

22:00.530 --> 22:02.420
然后看起来就跟新的一样
It'll look as good as new.

22:02.430 --> 22:04.520
这要花多长时间啊?
How long is it going to take?

22:04.530 --> 22:07.550
总之  我们今天会做完的
One way or another,we'll be out of here today.
