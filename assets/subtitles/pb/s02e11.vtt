能遇上你我感到很幸运

03:47.060 --> 03:49.960
对不起 亨利

04:10.530 --> 04:13.550
掌握政府是为了公司的利益
It's about corporate interests taking over the government--

04:13.560 --> 04:16.850
买到选票 打仗

04:16.860 --> 04:19.490
有人会死 他们从而得利

04:19.500 --> 04:21.590
我们想要阻止这些

04:21.600 --> 04:24.450

Just a handful of senators, congressmen,

04:26.900 --> 04:29.550
以及像我那样曾经为公司出过力的人
people like me that once worked for the company.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.350
人们想要揭露总统
People willing to expose

04:31.360 --> 04:33.220
揭开他的本来面目--
the president for what she is--

04:33.230 --> 04:35.020
一个公司抛出去的诱饵

04:37.830 --> 04:39.620
这和我有什么关系?

因为我们拉她下台的办法就是让你获得自由的办法

04:42.900 --> 04:45.720
大约一礼拜前 我们终于取得了突破

04:45.730 --> 04:49.190
一位国家安全局的分析师同意了我们的计划
An nsa analyst sympathetic

04:49.200 --> 04:55.350
他最终想办法进入并弄明白了那个梯次程序
to our cause finally worked his way up and got clearance into the Echelon program.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.990
全国各地的电子邮件以及电话
E-mails, cell phone calls all across this country,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.550
只要被传送 就会通过那个梯次程序
if it's transmitted, it goes through Echelon.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.020
会被分类 翻译 并且储存下来
It's calogued, interpreted,and then stored

05:02.030 --> 05:04.690
为了国家的安全
for homeland security.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.450
他们什么都不会放过
Nothing is missed by them.

05:06.460 --> 05:07.920
任何一切
Nothing.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.550
包括 一次偶然的机会
Including, by accident,

05:10.560 --> 05:13.590
在9-11后几个月...
for a few months after 9-11...

05:13.600 --> 05:15.520
白宫
the white house.

05:15.530 --> 05:21.590
那分析师监听到了总统和特伦斯·斯蒂德曼的电话
The analyst got his hands on a phone conversation the president had with Terrence Steadman...

05:21.600 --> 05:23.550
两周以后
two weeks after

05:23.560 --> 05:26.300
就会安排你杀了他
you supposedly killed him.

05:26.460 --> 05:33.130
后来 那分析师想要把这情报带出来
Now, the analyst tried to get this information out of the building...

05:33.530 --> 05:35.820
...但后来发现有其他人也在监听
but it turns out, someone else was snooping, too.

05:35.830 --> 05:38.820
(想知道真相就打开)
If you really want to know

05:38.830 --> 05:44.230
某些其他人 想要知道总统的一些事

05:47.430 --> 05:49.650
艾尔多和林肯想要单独待着
Aldo and Lincoln want to be left alone.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.300
当然了 我明白
Sure, I understand.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.250
24小时后 唐克雷蒂州长死了
24 hours later, tancredi is dead,

05:58.260 --> 05:59.320
那分析师也失踪了
the analyst is missing,

05:59.330 --> 06:04.830
而且白宫的梯次程序录音带也从主机上被删了
and the white house Echelon tapes have been deleted from the mainframe.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.590
那卷录音应该还在
The tape is still out there.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.790
想想他们对唐克雷蒂·莎拉追的那么紧
And judging by how hard they're going after Sara tancredi,

06:11.800 --> 06:14.990
我很肯定他们认为录音带就在她那
I'm pretty sure they think she has it.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.990
而且我想他们是对的
And I think they're right.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.890
她是整件事的关键
She's the key to this whole thing,

06:18.900 --> 06:22.860
林肯
Lincoln.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.200

08:45.360 --> 08:49.100
我明白
I understand.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.350
你也该知道了
As you can see,

08:58.360 --> 09:03.030
我不叫兰斯 也不是个吸毒者
hi, my name is not lance,and I'm not an addict.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.150

09:05.160 --> 09:09.320
现在我有件事对你来说很重要
There is one thing about me that should mean a great deal to you right now.

09:09.330 --> 09:11.550
那就是我是一个通情达理的人
That is I am reasonable.

09:11.560 --> 09:14.450
只要你告诉我你所知道的 我就放你走
If you tell me what you know, you get to go.

09:14.460 --> 09:15.890
好吧 或许
Okay, and then maybe

09:15.900 --> 09:17.190
考虑到我们之间的关系
when this is all behind us,

09:17.200 --> 09:20.090
你应该想一想我们以前的老交情
we get to grab a piece of pie for old times' sake.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.330
好吗
Okay.

09:27.660 --> 09:30.050
我不知道迈克尔在哪
I don't know where Michael is.

09:30.060 --> 09:33.290
这和迈克尔无关 是关于你父亲的
This is not about Michael; this is about your father.

09:33.300 --> 09:34.550
他在华盛顿留了些东西
He left washington with

09:34.560 --> 09:36.120
一些不属于他的东西
something that didn't belong to him.

09:36.130 --> 09:37.620
我们想要回来
We need it back.

09:37.630 --> 09:38.720
就为了这你杀了他?
And you killed him for it.

09:38.730 --> 09:43.220
不 我没有 这不值得我这么做
I didn't, no, for what that's worth.

09:43.230 --> 09:45.550
但我也希望他的死
But I hope that his death

09:45.560 --> 09:51.060

10:01.330 --> 10:02.720
在哪?

10:02.730 --> 10:05.490
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.690
莎拉 对这事我还有进一步的办法
Sara, there's a next step involved in this,

10:08.700 --> 10:13.860
你一定不会想尝尝的
and you don't want to experience that.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.750
我向天发誓 我真的不知道你说什么
I swear to god I don't know what you're talking about.

10:18.760 --> 10:22.390
我爸爸没给我任何东西
My father didn't give me anything.

10:22.400 --> 10:27.100
我真的不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:49.630 --> 10:51.490

bless me, father, for I have sinned.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.490

How long has it been since your last confession?

10:53.500 --> 10:55.220
这是第一次
This is my first time.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.390
有生以来
In a long time.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.090
你知道你的罪行的本质吗?
Are you aware of the nature of your sins?

11:01.100 --> 11:04.930
本质?
The nature?

11:05.330 --> 11:07.990
我不太确定
I'm not really sure.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.930
在你内心深处你是知道的
Deep down inside your heart, you know.

11:12.330 --> 11:15.590
也许是正义的吧
Righteousness, maybe.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.190
相信到最后能为我的所做所为正名
Believing the ends justify the means.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.250
你的最后目的是什么？
What are those ends?

11:21.260 --> 11:22.890
拯救一个人的生命
Saving someone's life.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.050
那你的所做所为呢?
And the means?

11:25.060 --> 11:30.220
我几乎破坏了所有的法律
I've broken just about every law you can name.

11:30.230 --> 11:33.660
但这不仅仅是我所做过的事...
But it's not just what I've done.

11:34.330 --> 11:37.350
还有其他人做的事...
It's what others have done...

11:37.360 --> 11:40.820
...因为是我让他们做的
because I let them.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.950
因为我觉得自己在做正确的事
Because I was doing what I thought was right.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.890
本来这次我应该更明白的...
I should have known better this time.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.800
这次?
This time?

11:50.230 --> 11:54.100
当我还是个孩子的时候...
When I was a kid...

11:54.460 --> 11:58.260
我眼看着一个人流血致死
I watched a man bleed out and die.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.490
而且我很高兴...
And I was glad...

12:03.500 --> 12:04.920
因为这是他应得的
because he deserved it.

12:04.930 --> 12:06.120
生命

12:06.130 --> 12:08.820
-是只有上帝才有权赋予或者带走的  孩子-突然间
is only for god to give and take, my son.-Suddenly,

12:08.830 --> 12:12.920
在我内心就有了阴影
there is this dark space inside of me.

12:12.930 --> 12:16.060
我知道那是不对的
And I knew it was wrong.

12:17.030 --> 12:18.450
但事已至此
But here I am.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.020
有办法来挽回的
There is a way to stop this.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.620
把你的意志交给上帝
Surrender your will to god.

12:22.630 --> 12:25.520
如果我现在放弃
If I surrender now,

12:25.530 --> 12:28.290
我会失去我所爱的一切
I lose everything that I love.

12:28.300 --> 12:34.360
会失去你的灵魂吗?
But do you lose your soul in the process?

12:36.330 --> 12:41.700
人人都有自己的信仰
Well, we all have our crosses to bear.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.060
你还好吗?
You okay?

12:48.660 --> 12:50.250
这永远都不会停止
This is never gonna stop.

12:50.260 --> 12:53.200
他们会不断来追杀我们
They're gna keep coming after us.

13:08.300 --> 13:12.100

13:13.260 --> 13:14.890
搞定了吗?

和你派来杀我儿子的其他人一个下场
Just like anyone else you send to take out my son.

13:27.960 --> 13:31.150

13:32.830 --> 13:33.920

我会亲手掐死你

13:39.200 --> 13:42.400
你都不知道我是谁
You don't even know who I am.

13:49.730 --> 13:52.090

你能把门打开吗?
Can you open the gate?

15:38.260 --> 15:42.420
我还需要辆车
And I need a new vehicle.

15:42.430 --> 15:44.320
我想你还不够了解我
There's something you should know about me.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.450
我不太喜欢直接参与到行动中
I don't like being out in the field.

15:46.460 --> 15:50.360
只有出了茬子我才会来
I only do so when there's been a screwup.

15:50.930 --> 15:53.420
我现在也参与了  亚历山大
I'm out in the field, Alex.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.950
那么你为什么不把门打开?
Then why don't you open the gate?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.490
然后就赶快回华盛顿去
You can hurry back to D.C.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.490
免得把鞋弄脏了
before your shoes get dirty.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.120
我们有个线索可以知道林肯
We have a lead as to where Burrows

16:01.130 --> 16:02.420
和他弟弟碰头的地点
will be meeting up with his brother.

16:02.430 --> 16:04.650
一个他叫波茨瓦波什的地方
It's a place he referred to as "Bolshoi Booze."

16:04.660 --> 16:06.520
你知道那个地方吗?
Does that mean anything to you?

16:06.530 --> 16:08.750
是的  那是斯科菲尔德身上的一百多个纹身之一
Yeah, it's one of a hundred tattoos on Scofield's body.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.290
是什么意思?
What does it mean?

16:10.300 --> 16:11.590
我现在还不知道
I don't know yet.

16:11.600 --> 16:12.850
你必须要在接下来的
You'll need to figure it out

16:12.860 --> 16:14.050
几个小时里面破解出来
within the next couple of hours.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.690
如果斯科菲尔德和布伦斯越过了边境
If Scofield and Burrows cross the border,

16:15.700 --> 16:16.990
他们就在你的司法权之外了
they'll be out of your jurisdiction,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.900
你对我们也就没价值了
and you'll be of no further value to us.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.290
开门
Open the gate.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.590
然后你能做什么?
So you can do what?

16:26.600 --> 16:28.290
我想先听听
I want to hear it.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.790
这位本来指望着帮我们结案的人打算怎么做
Straight from the mouth of the guy who's supposed to be our closer.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.820
我会抓住斯科菲尔德
I'll get Scofield

16:31.830 --> 16:34.790
和布伦斯...还有剩下的人
and Burrows...and all of the rest of them.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.320
之后你和我
And then me and you

16:37.330 --> 16:38.790
还有凯勒曼
and Kellerman,

16:38.800 --> 16:40.550
各走各的路
we're going to part ways.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.760
我只希望你动机明确
I just hope you're properly motivated.

16:54.400 --> 17:00.600
因为只要你尽职了 我们就不会记起查尔斯的事
'Cause as long as you do your job, we'll forget about Shales.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.320
然后你就能回科罗拉多去见你的儿子
And then you can go back to Colorado and visit your son.

17:04.330 --> 17:05.790
卡麦隆
Cameron.

17:05.800 --> 17:09.030
他五岁了  是吧?
He's five, right?

17:10.200 --> 17:13.620
不许你再提起他的名字
Don't you ever mention his name again.

17:13.630 --> 17:16.490
这就对了
There he is.

17:16.500 --> 17:20.430
这就是我想听的
That's what I wanted to hear.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.550
去破解它  亚历山大
Get cracking, Alex.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.600
好多人就指望着你了
A lot of people are relying on you.

17:36.460 --> 17:39.750
珍妮会照顾好的  你可以信任她
Jane will take care of it; you can trust her.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.690
我知道这很不容易
I know this is hard,

17:41.700 --> 17:45.900
但是会好起来的  相信我
but it will work out--you have my word.

17:45.930 --> 17:49.900
-谢谢-多加小心
-Thank you.-Be careful.

17:58.030 --> 18:01.590
听着  恩...
Listen, uh...

18:01.600 --> 18:05.150
我明白
I know.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.390
珍妮会照顾你的
Jane's gonna look after you.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.990
我都不认识她
I don't even know her.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.120
她没问题的
She's all right.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.120
她为爸爸做事已经有段时间了
She's been working for Dad for a while.

18:12.130 --> 18:16.230
我会...
I'll, uh...

18:16.600 --> 18:19.830
我很快就会见到你的  我保证...
I'll see you soon, I promise.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.290
是不是你爸爸也这么跟你说过?
Isn't that the same thing your dad told you?

18:22.300 --> 18:25.960
是的  但我说话算话
Yeah, but I mean it.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.250
是我
Hey.Hey, it's me.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.390
收到给我打个电话好吗?
Just call me when you get this, okay?

20:03.400 --> 20:06.760
有要紧事
It's important.

20:38.960 --> 20:44.160
这是数字
the numbers...

21:38.400 --> 21:41.460
这个是我的报酬吗？
Is that my payment?

21:41.930 --> 21:43.690
医用硝化甘油
Medical nitroglycerine?

21:43.700 --> 21:46.760
我答应过你的
As promised.

21:52.660 --> 21:57.820
你可不了解要弄到这样的货色有多难
You have no idea how hard it is to get this kind of grade.

21:57.830 --> 21:58.920
就算利用我的关系也未必可以
Even with my contacts.

21:58.930 --> 22:00.820
那么该是你实现交易的时候了
It's time for your end of the deal.

22:00.830 --> 22:02.690
飞机在哪里？
Where's that plane gonna be?

22:02.700 --> 22:07.550
降落前几小时他们会打电话告诉我地点的
They call me a couple of hours before with the drop-off point.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.350
为了甩掉药品管理局的追踪
It keeps the DEA off our backs.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.090
既然还有一会时间
Since it's going to be a while,

22:11.100 --> 22:13.550
进去避避太阳吧
you might want to stay out of the sun.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.800
(西班牙语)

22:25.360 --> 22:26.450
有问题吗？
Is there a problem?

22:26.460 --> 22:30.300
他们是我的表兄弟
They're my cousins.

22:39.600 --> 22:43.220
在你父亲得到消息之前
Now, after your father accessed

22:43.230 --> 22:45.960
他用手机打了3个电话
this information, he made three calls from his cell phone,

22:46.830 --> 22:48.920
全都是给你的
all to you.

22:48.930 --> 22:50.850
他告诉了你什么？
What did he tell you?

22:50.860 --> 22:52.790
他刚从芝加哥回来
Just that he was coming back to Chicago.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.390
好
Good.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.020
你现在变老实了 很好
You're being honest. Good.

22:56.030 --> 22:59.250
在你父亲飞机降落和你到家的时候
Now, there's a half an hour between when your father landed

22:59.260 --> 23:01.950
有半个小时的间隔 我不清楚
and when he got home that is unaccounted for.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.520
我知道你曾在他办公室停留过
I know you stopped by his office.

23:03.530 --> 23:06.050
-你见到了他吗？-没有
-Did you see him there?-No.

23:06.060 --> 23:08.690
我最后次见他是在书房 但是已经死了
The last time I saw my father,he was dead in his study.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.050
他让其他人给你任何消息了吗?
Did your father have anyone give you anything?

23:11.060 --> 23:12.390
你认为我会隐瞒你什么吗？
Do you think that I'm just withholding information

23:12.400 --> 23:13.750
因为我喜欢和你在一起
because I like hanging out with you?

23:13.760 --> 23:14.920
所以如果我知道什么事情
If I knew something,

23:14.930 --> 23:16.320
我会告诉你的  但是我不知道
I would tell you; I don't.

23:16.330 --> 23:18.450
我对此一无所知
I don't know anything about any of this.

23:18.460 --> 23:19.490
真的?
Really?

23:19.500 --> 23:21.590
那么为什么你会给他
Then why did you give your father the file

23:21.600 --> 23:23.150
关于林肯布伦斯的资料
on Lincoln Burrows?

23:23.160 --> 23:24.990
为什么你会为斯科菲尔德开门
Why did you open the door for Scofield,

23:25.000 --> 23:26.650
帮他逃出监狱
and help him escape?

23:26.660 --> 23:28.590
为什么他寄给你这些密笺?
Why did Scofield send you those coded notes?

23:28.600 --> 23:33.160
为什么你会来新墨西哥见他?
Why did you come to New Mexico to meet him?

23:34.400 --> 23:36.820
别和我耍花样
Don't try to float a babe-in-the-woods routine by me.

23:36.830 --> 23:39.320
你这样会让我很生气 那么...
It's really going to piss me off, so...

23:39.330 --> 23:42.860
说吧
Come on.

24:00.800 --> 24:04.630
没事的
You're okay.

24:09.830 --> 24:13.890
听着 莎拉
Look, Sara.

24:13.900 --> 24:18.400
你知道  我们正在达成共识  对吧
We're going to have to come to an understanding.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.550
是的 你是对的 他们是预谋好的
Yeah, you were right;they are coordinates.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.890
在GPS上定好他们的坐标
Plug them into your GPS.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.650
他们会带你去一个地方
They'll take you to a spot in the New Mexico desert.

24:32.660 --> 24:35.420
大概在沙漠的某个中心
It's in the middle of nowhere, basically.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.520
谢谢
Thanks.

24:36.530 --> 24:37.690
好的 没问题
Yeah, no problem.

24:37.700 --> 24:41.020
长官  你在和谁见面?
Sir, who are you meeting?

24:41.030 --> 24:42.450
他究竟在干什么?
What the hell is he doing?

24:42.460 --> 24:47.430
让我们别插手  他就在干这个
He's keeping us out of the loop,that's what he's doing.

24:47.860 --> 24:50.720
多次逃过了法律的制裁
Constantly running from the law with a bad heart...

24:50.730 --> 24:53.020
墨西哥  我的故乡 有许多好东西
Mexico, where I'm from has got a lot of great things,

24:53.030 --> 24:56.290
但是...没有好的医疗条件
but... health care ain't one of them.

24:56.300 --> 24:58.220
你还好吧?
You all right?

24:58.230 --> 24:59.950
你有点紧张
You look a little nervous.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.120
我可不是天天都干这个的
I don't do this every day.

25:02.130 --> 25:03.750
我想知道关于这架飞机
I just want to get the information on that plane

25:03.760 --> 25:05.090
还有
and, uh...

25:05.100 --> 25:07.020
继续上路
move on.

25:07.030 --> 25:08.320
就这样？
Is that it?

25:08.330 --> 25:09.990
就这样
Is that it?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.090
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.250
你看上去有点紧张
You don't have to worry

25:15.260 --> 25:16.950
我们不会和联邦探员有交易
we can't go within 100 feet of a federal marshal

25:16.960 --> 25:18.390
去领奖赏的
to collect the reward,

25:18.400 --> 25:21.990
因为我们的脑袋在美国和墨西哥都没有保障
'cause we got U.S. and Mexican warrants on our heads.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.720
但是至于去巴拿马的飞机
But this plane to Panama...

25:24.730 --> 25:28.930
坐下吧
Sit down.

25:33.730 --> 25:36.120
这全都是为了你的哥哥?
This is all for your brother?

25:36.130 --> 25:38.720
是的
Yes.

25:38.730 --> 25:41.420
我有4个兄弟 2个在监狱
I got four brothers,two in prison.

25:41.430 --> 25:43.150
帮个小忙?  没问题
Accept a call? Yes.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.120
不过帮他们逃出来?  太疯狂了
But break them out? Loco.

25:45.130 --> 25:47.690
我的哥哥给了我一个棒球手套
My brother gave me a baseball mitt

25:47.700 --> 25:50.120
作为14岁的生日礼物
for my 14th birthday.

25:50.130 --> 25:51.990
所以 我欠他的
I owed him.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.050
你这个作兄弟的比我好啊
You're a better man than I am.

25:54.060 --> 25:57.130
让时间来见证吧
Time will tell.

26:04.860 --> 26:07.890
他们到现在应该打电话来了吧
Shouldn't they have called by now...about the plane?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.650
是的
Yeah.

26:09.660 --> 26:13.920
但是  我有个问题
You know, I...I have a question.

26:13.930 --> 26:15.520
我想
I thought

26:15.530 --> 26:17.620
我觉得这些应该是玻璃管装
that these came in glass vials,

26:17.630 --> 26:20.120
不是塑料装的
not plastic.

26:20.130 --> 26:24.450
我也怀疑过 但是卖我的人说
I thought so, too, but the guy I bought it from said

26:24.460 --> 26:26.220
就是用塑料管包装的
he packed it in plastic

26:26.230 --> 26:29.250
再运输过程中防碎 防火
for transportation over long distances to prevent a fire

26:29.260 --> 26:31.450
或者防爆炸
or an explosion.

26:31.460 --> 26:33.750
真的?
Really?

26:33.760 --> 26:36.900
怎么从来没有听过
I never heard of that.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.990
怎么了
I never heard of that.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.450
我们要做一些品质鉴定
We're going to do a little quality control test.

26:49.460 --> 26:50.850
这是最好的现货
It's the best available.

26:50.860 --> 26:54.460
我们不急
We got time.

27:26.830 --> 27:28.750
上次 一些二十出头的黑人
For the last time,some black male, early 20s,

27:28.760 --> 27:30.050
从我后面跳了出来
jumped me from behind.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.920
我连他们的脸都没看清楚
I didn't get a good look at his face.

27:31.930 --> 27:33.490
凶手从背后袭击的你？
The assailant attacked you from behind?

27:33.500 --> 27:34.920
就是这样
That's what I just said.

27:34.930 --> 27:37.420
他试图攻击你的前额
Yet he managed to make contact square on your forehead.

27:37.430 --> 27:38.650
对啊
That's right.

27:38.660 --> 27:40.320
用什么敲的?回旋镖?
With what? A boomerang?

27:40.330 --> 27:42.150
别这样 告诉我到底发生了什么了
Come on, why don't you tell me what happened?

27:42.160 --> 27:44.690
听着 我是一个退休的伊利诺斯州狱警
Look, I'm a retired correctional officer out of Illinois.

27:44.700 --> 27:49.460
要不要展示下我的专业礼仪？ 宝贝
How about showing some professional courtesy, honey?

27:57.500 --> 27:59.150
我是罗伊 格雷  请留言
This is Roy Geary.Leave a message.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.420
你这个狗娘养的
You thieving son of a bitch.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.190
最好跪下来
You better get down on your knees

28:03.200 --> 28:04.820
向上帝祈祷别让我找到你
and pray to God that I don't find you,

28:04.830 --> 28:06.520
如果你被我逮到
because, if I do,mark my words,

28:06.530 --> 28:09.460
小心你的小命
I'm going to gut you bow to stern.

28:11.830 --> 28:14.150
今天早上总统莱娜斯在佛罗里达州塔拉哈西市
President Reynolds was in Tallahassee, Florida,

28:14.160 --> 28:17.850
参加了一个为正在重选的
early this morning, attending a $5,000-a-plate breakfast fund-raiser

28:17.860 --> 28:21.890
参议员马丁 奎汉茨举行的筹款会
for senator martin kleinhenz,who's running for reelection.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.350
今天下午  记者招待会被搅乱了
Later this afternoon, her press conference was derailed

28:24.360 --> 28:26.290
一个记者要求评论
when a reporter asked her to comment

28:26.300 --> 28:29.050
关于林肯逃狱的事情
on Lincoln Burrows'escape from custody.

28:29.060 --> 28:30.450
她拒绝了
She declined.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.520
这表明了在她上任一个月以来
It's become clear in her first month in office

28:32.530 --> 28:36.190
都不能脱离和这次猎捕行动的关系
that she cannot separate herself from this manhunt.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.450
只要猎捕行动还在进行
And as long as it continues...

28:39.460 --> 28:42.400
...专家们分析关于布伦斯的问题会继...
...pundits say that questions about Burrows will contin...

28:44.960 --> 28:46.690
女士们
Ladies.

28:46.700 --> 28:49.750
让我们开始狂欢吧
Let's get this party started.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.250
在过去30年中我恨你
The last 30 years,I've hated you.

28:52.260 --> 28:56.660
你抛弃了我
You walked out on me.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.950
你都没有见过迈克尔
You haven't even seen Michael.

28:59.960 --> 29:03.220
我见过了
I've seen him before.

29:03.230 --> 29:06.150
不是在报纸上 爸爸
Not in the papers, Dad.

29:06.160 --> 29:11.330
我一直在想什么样的男人会放弃家人
Been trying to work out what kind of man abandons his family.

29:11.630 --> 29:16.200
现在我在做同样的事情
Now I'm doing the same damn thing.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.020
你会见到他的
You'll see him again.

29:18.030 --> 29:21.360
我保证
I'll make sure of it.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.720
还要开多久
How much further?

29:24.730 --> 29:27.700

29:35.030 --> 29:36.450
我的兄弟就到这里了
My brother should be here soon.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.720
可能我应该出去 确保他能够看见我
Maybe I should go outside and make sure he can see me.

29:38.730 --> 29:39.890
好主意
That's a good idea.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.350
我派伊内斯多去做
I think I'm gonna send Ernesto to do it.

29:41.360 --> 29:45.360

Ernesto, por favor.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.150
你好

Was that the call?

30:10.500 --> 30:11.590
关于飞机的?

30:11.600 --> 30:17.690

30:19.930 --> 30:21.720
你犯了个大错误
You just made a big mistake,blanquito.

30:21.730 --> 30:23.450
对不起 对不起 好吗?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

30:23.460 --> 30:24.750
我不是个化学家
I'm not a chemist.

30:24.760 --> 30:28.020
卖给我的家伙发誓说是医用硝化甘油
The guy I bought it from swore it was medical nitro.

30:28.030 --> 30:29.220
我们都被耍了
We both got screwed.

30:29.230 --> 30:31.120
是的 但是只有一个人会付出代价
Yeah, but only one of us is gonna pay for it.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.150
听着 我只想从这出去
Look, I just want to get out of here,

30:32.160 --> 30:33.420
而你想得到你要的报酬
and you want your payment.

30:33.430 --> 30:34.850
我的兄弟很快就来了
My brother's gonna be here soon.

30:34.860 --> 30:36.490
我们可以商量
We'll work something out.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.920
出个价吧
Just name your price.

30:38.930 --> 30:41.790
我已经出价了
I already named my price.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.200
但你没有兑现
You didn't go through.

30:55.030 --> 30:56.520
你的兄弟到底什么时候到
When's your brother getting here?

30:56.530 --> 31:00.090
你一直在盘算着利用我们  对不对
You were planning on turning us in the whole time, weren't you?

31:00.100 --> 31:01.250
他什么时候能到
When's he supposed to meet you here?!

31:01.260 --> 31:02.520
(西班牙语)

31:02.530 --> 31:04.520
放下枪  否则我就开枪了
Drop it, or I'm gonna shoot him.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.020
让他走  否则我就杀了你
Let him go, or I'll shoot you.

31:36.100 --> 31:39.090
林肯 布伦斯吗?
Lincoln Burrows.

31:39.100 --> 31:42.520
街头的暴徒而已
Street thug.

31:42.530 --> 31:43.750
你为什么会那么想?
And why is that your concern?

31:43.760 --> 31:45.520
我是说 这难道是医生立下的誓言吗
I mean, is there somewhere in the Hippocratic Oath

31:45.530 --> 31:49.890
所谓的 我保证会冒着生命危险去救毫不关心我的人
where it says,"I pledge to risk my life for those who don't care about mine"?

31:49.900 --> 31:51.820
他们是不会关心你的生死的
'Cause they don't care about yours.

31:51.830 --> 31:56.850
布伦斯和迈克尔 斯科菲尔德是在利用你
Burrows and Michael Scofield just used you.

31:56.860 --> 31:58.990
你是否感到很惊讶这个世界上还是有人会
Are you that surprised that there are people in the world

31:59.000 --> 32:01.390
勇敢的抵抗像你这样的人?
who will stand up to people like you?

32:01.400 --> 32:02.490
你连这都不知道吗?
Are you that far gone?

32:02.500 --> 32:05.090
很可爱
That's cute.

32:05.100 --> 32:07.320
真是悲哀啊
Sad.

32:07.330 --> 32:10.330
但很可爱
But cute.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.250
克里夫兰什么?
A Cleveland what?

32:26.260 --> 32:28.220
别担心  我会慢慢跟你说的
Don't worry,I'll talk you through it.

32:28.230 --> 32:33.200
我们这儿有张玻璃咖啡桌
And we got a glass coffee table right here.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.450

Hell no.

32:34.460 --> 32:36.260

33:08.660 --> 33:11.900
闪人
Leave.

33:14.130 --> 33:15.890
你知道
You know,

33:15.900 --> 33:21.590
在军品店你能买到很多不可思议的东西
it's amazing what you can pick up at an Army-Navy store.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.420
那些折磨你的手段都是贝利克的主意
All that torture stuff,that was Bellick's idea.

33:24.430 --> 33:27.290
我也觉得他做的太过分了
And if you ask me, he took the whole thing way too far.

33:27.300 --> 33:28.850
听着
Listen,

33:28.860 --> 33:31.120
我分你一半钱  然后我们就此了解?
why don't I just give you half the money,and we call it a day?

33:31.130 --> 33:33.120
好吧  六四开

飞机会降落在哪儿?
Where's the plane going to land?

33:44.000 --> 33:46.700
去死吧混蛋
Kiss my ass, cobarde.

33:51.260 --> 33:52.620
我们该怎么做?
What are we going to do?

33:52.630 --> 33:54.090
我也不知道
I don't know yet.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.790
我们不能从地面穿越边境
We're not going to get across the border on the ground.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.590
没飞机我们就完了
Without that plane,we're screwed.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.090
他失血过多了
He's losing too much blood.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.690
他这样活不下去的
He'll never make it like this.He should have thought

34:01.700 --> 34:02.950
在他开枪打我们的时候就应该想明白的
of that before he tried to kill us.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.220
我们必须要送他去医院
We got to take him to a hospital,

34:04.230 --> 34:05.450

就算我知道也不告诉你
Even if I knew,I wouldn't tell you.

41:58.460 --> 41:59.950
不告诉我?  是吗？
You wouldn't? Really?

41:59.960 --> 42:01.420
你有那么笨?
Are you that stupid?

42:01.430 --> 42:03.150

因为你现在必须要死了!
Because now you're going to die!

42:05.300 --> 42:07.920
你要死了 除非你告诉我
You're going to die,and all you had to do

42:07.930 --> 42:11.750
你父亲给了你什么
is tell me what your father gave you.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.320
我知道我的处境
I know my options.

42:13.330 --> 42:16.020
要么什么也不说的死  或者说了
I can not tell you and die,or I can tell you

42:16.030 --> 42:17.520
还是死
and still die.

42:17.530 --> 42:19.190
错了
No. Wrong.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.720
莎拉
Sara.

42:20.730 --> 42:22.690
得了  放聪明点吧!
Come on, smarten up!

42:22.700 --> 42:24.950
哪怕你一辈子就这么一次
For once in your life.

42:24.960 --> 42:29.800
拜托了
For once in your life.

42:33.530 --> 42:38.330
去死吧
Go to hell.

42:40.700 --> 42:44.590
溺死是很恐怖的   别误解我
Huh? Drowning is horrific--don't get me wrong--

42:44.600 --> 42:47.550
但是一到你憋不住让水进到肺里
but once you give in and let the water come into your lungs,

42:47.560 --> 42:48.620
会产生某种快感
there's a certain

42:48.630 --> 42:50.620
我听说的
euphoria... I hear.

42:50.630 --> 42:52.250
我猜作为一个瘾君子
I guess as a junkie,

42:52.260 --> 42:55.660
我想你大概会喜欢那样
I thought maybe you'd appreciate that.

42:56.960 --> 43:00.660
是你让自己落到这种下场的
You did this to yourself.
