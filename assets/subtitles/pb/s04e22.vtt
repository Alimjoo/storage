天啊  什么都没有

00:09.960 --> 00:12.170
他们就要弄清楚了
They're figuring it out.

00:13.260 --> 00:15.470
这是种什么样的炸药
What kind of explosives are we talking about?

00:15.640 --> 00:16.760
自制炸药
Little home brew.

00:16.930 --> 00:19.310
迈克说它能释放出C4塑胶炸药
Michael says it has the energy release of C4.

Almost C4?

00:30.610 --> 00:32.190
是的

低头  我们开始
Yeah, put your head down, let's go.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.550
开始
Let's go.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.650
随着时间的流逝
You know, someday,weeks will go by. Maybe even years.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.020
我们会淡忘这些事
It won't even cross our minds.

01:12.190 --> 01:14.150
只要我们活下去
Yeah, all we gotta do is survive.

01:14.990 --> 01:16.280
我们会的
We will.

01:17.070 --> 01:18.820
我保证
Promise.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.330
-发生什么事了  -没反应
-What happened? -Nothing.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.040
引爆器一定失灵了
The detonator must have failed.

01:27.210 --> 01:29.750
拖住他们  我们五分钟后到
Distract them. We'll be there in five minutes.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.630
-我们没有时间了  -那你必须手动引爆
-No, we don't have five seconds. -Then you'll have to trigger it manually.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.800
我有多少时间
How much time is that gonna give me?

01:39.760 --> 01:41.800
滚出来  马上
Out. Now.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.850
阿历克斯
Alex?

01:46.810 --> 01:48.270
阿历克斯
Alex?

01:48.440 --> 01:50.650
这里面什么都没有
It's wiped clean.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.900

-That's not possible.-Really?

01:53.070 --> 01:57.070
-那它在哪  数据在哪  -我拿的时候还好好的
-Then where is it? Where is the data? -It was intact when I took it.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.490
听着
I'll tell you what.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.700
如果它10秒钟内没反应
It doesn't boot up in 10 seconds...

02:00.870 --> 02:03.700
我会让你脑浆迸发
...I'm gonna splatter your skull all over these walls.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.830
是我来主动找的你
I came to you.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.210
我想结束这一切  我不会陷自己于不义
I want this over, I wouldn’t jeopardize that.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.710
我不相信迈克就这么让你拿走
I don't believe that Michael just let you have it.

02:14.340 --> 02:17.630
他没有  趁他不在时我拿的
He didn't. He left me alone in a room and I took it.

02:18.220 --> 02:21.390
他就一点没怀疑你
And that wasn't the least bit suspicious to you?

02:21.550 --> 02:23.470
也许吧  我
Maybe, I--

02:24.640 --> 02:25.770
我不知道
I don't know.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.390
你是在耍我吧
Are you lying?

02:32.360 --> 02:33.650

你呼吸困难  是不是很痛
Your breathing's short? Does it hurt?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.330
-我还好  -你好像是肺部虚脱
-I'm fine.-Like hell, you collapsed your lung.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.580

Buried.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.360
你个废物

03:57.520 --> 04:00.150
莎拉是我们的唯一筹码
Sara was the only leverage we had.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.030
斯科菲尔德是个全才  可啥时候成蜘蛛侠了
Scofield's donned many a chapeau, but human fly?

04:04.200 --> 04:07.240
我哪知道他会飞檐走壁
I should anticipate him scaling the building?

04:07.410 --> 04:11.000
布饶发  给我枪
Move on Panama. Broffer, your .9.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.840
巴格威尔  为我卖命的人
Men in my employ, Bagwell...

04:21.170 --> 04:22.550
要履行职责
...anticipate.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.260
尽忠职守
They cover their bases.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.640
他们都能完成任务
They refuse to fail...

04:27.800 --> 04:31.810
但你却一事无成
...which you seem to do with unyielding consistency.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.270
莎拉的手机
That's gotta be Sara's phone.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.940
我必须接
I should answer it.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.690
将军  你不会有什么损失的
What do you got to lose, general?

04:44.700 --> 04:46.160
喂
Hello.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.620
谁
Who the hell is this?

04:47.780 --> 04:50.580
是费尔南多·苏克雷吗  谢天谢地
Is this Fernando Sucre? Oh, thank you, God.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.620
-巴格威尔
-Bagwell?

04:52.790 --> 04:55.830
我们是一条船上的  一条船
And we're on the same team, brother. Same team.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.380
我正处于水深火热中  
The old boy's in a hell of a pickle.

04:58.540 --> 04:59.590
迈克在哪
Where's Michael?

05:01.170 --> 05:04.630
他妈妈抓走了他还有唐克雷蒂跟林肯
Uh, his mother snatched him and Tancredi, Linc too.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.550
而我吃了一记闷棍
And I, personally, took a nasty beat down.

05:07.720 --> 05:11.010
-她把他们关哪了  -我知道  但不能在电话里说
-Where does she have them? -I got an idea, I can't say on the phone.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.310
我得小心点  朋友
I'm running scared, amigo.

05:12.470 --> 05:14.560
冷静
Okay, cool it, you know what?

05:14.730 --> 05:17.940
我们找到个人能帮我们  但我要找到迈克
We got somebody who can help us but I need to get ahold of Michael.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.610
我们应该碰碰头  通通信息
We should, uh, get together and pool our resources.

05:20.770 --> 05:23.610
72大街的公园  1小时后见
The park on 72nd Avenue. Uh, in an hour.

05:26.030 --> 05:29.160

你找到能帮忙的人了
You got someone who can help on his cause.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.750
我相信他能引出斯科菲尔德
I'm certain he can draw out Scofield.

05:35.910 --> 05:37.920
你相信个屁
You're certain of nothing.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.460
但我一小时后要跟斯科菲尔德的朋友见面
Yet I do have a sit-down with Scofield's friend in an hour.

05:41.630 --> 05:43.460
将军  你没有更好的办法了
You got no better hand, general.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.680
跟着他去
Go with him.

05:48.510 --> 05:51.930
如果他有古怪  打爆他的头
If he gets squirrelly,put a bullet in his brain.

06:42.310 --> 06:44.570
你还真是稀客
You are a sight for sore eyes,my friend.

06:44.730 --> 06:45.860
少来了
Can the reunion.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.740
-迈克和林肯在哪  -他们处境不妙
-Where can I find Michael and Lincoln? -Apparently they're at dire straits.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.320
你聋了吗
Are you deaf?

06:51.450 --> 06:54.910
好着呢  刚才还听到你身上的硬币响
Unlikely, amigo, I just heard the dime drop on your sorry ass.

06:55.080 --> 06:59.250
看到我左肩旁的人吗
From the bench over my left shoulder,the gentleman in the Wayfarers.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.290
你脑袋还像在福克斯河一样不好使  
Like in Fox River,you never thought things through.

07:03.420 --> 07:07.380
告诉我要帮那兄弟俩的人是谁
You're gonna name the friend who said he'd show up and help out the brothers.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.970
把莎拉的手机给我  不然我打破你的脸
No, you're gonna hand Sara's phone or I'll break your face.

07:11.130 --> 07:14.180
说我是聋子  我看你是瞎子
You accuse me of being deaf,you're the one who's gone blind.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.810
那家伙可是公司一流的杀手
The man's a Company operative-trained assassin.

07:22.190 --> 07:23.480
伙计  你好啊
What's up, Jethro?

07:33.280 --> 07:35.830
我们可不是在福克斯河了  T-Bag  走吧
We're a long way from Fox River,T-Bag. Let's go.

07:40.330 --> 07:42.160
我拿到唐克雷蒂的电话了
Yeah, I got Tancredi's phone.

07:42.330 --> 07:45.330
往一个号码打了很多次
There's a bunch of calls made to a single number.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.340
应该是迈克的号
I think it's Michael's.

07:53.260 --> 07:55.680
他有糖尿病吗  是否忘了吃药
Is he diabetic? Medication he may have missed?

07:55.850 --> 07:58.010
不清楚  他是不是装的
I have no idea.Any chance he's faking it?

07:58.180 --> 07:59.770
不是  瞳孔放大
No, pupils are dilated.

07:59.930 --> 08:02.560
他需要CT透视  心电图和胸部X光
He needs a head CT stat,EKG and a chest x-ray.

08:02.730 --> 08:05.650
可能是脑淤血或心脏病
May have bled into his brain or had a heart attack.

08:05.810 --> 08:09.150
弗朗哥  仓库里不仅有斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯
Franco. It wasn’t just Scofield and Burrows.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.030
还有赛尔夫
This is the team that Self had at the warehouse.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.490
前联邦探员
Former federal agent.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.620
赛尔夫干了些不法勾当
Yeah, Self was into something nasty.

08:17.950 --> 08:19.580
赛尔夫  能听到吗
Agent Self, can you hear me?

08:19.740 --> 08:21.540
弗朗哥探员  我们要把他转移
Agent Franco, we have to move him.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.290
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯在哪
Where are Scofield and Burrows?

08:23.460 --> 08:25.330
我们要走了
We're going now.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.550
等等  他的手动了  他能听见
Wait, his finger moved.He can hear me.

08:30.130 --> 08:32.260
赛尔夫探员  你能帮助我们吗
Agent Self, can you help us?

08:33.340 --> 08:34.720
他哪都不能去
He's not going anywhere.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.640
迈克  计划是什么
Michael, what's the plan?

08:38.810 --> 08:40.140
我们能相信谁
Who do we trust?

08:40.310 --> 08:42.310
没有人
No one.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.850
我们别无选择
We're out of options.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.400
我们应该把它毁了
Then maybe we destroy it.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.480
别无选择吗
Is that it?

08:51.610 --> 08:52.990
穷途末路了吗
Is that where we're at?

08:54.570 --> 08:57.030
如果将军决定报复应该怎么办
What if the general decides to retaliate?

08:57.200 --> 08:59.450
即使我们给了他  他也会的
He will even if we give it to him.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.910
我们可以把它弄碎  烧了
We can crush it, incinerate it.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.000
扔到海里
Throw in the ocean.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.870
-都行  -阿历克斯
-All three sound good.-Alex?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.170
好吧
All right.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.130
就这么决定了
Then it's decided.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.720
喂
Hello?

09:21.890 --> 09:23.970
你好  迈克
Hello, Michael.

09:24.890 --> 09:26.190
凯勒曼
Kellerman.

09:28.770 --> 09:30.980
你可真不好找啊
You're a tough man to get ahold of.

09:39.450 --> 09:41.530
听说你死了
I heard you were dead.

09:41.700 --> 09:45.040
那些流言言过其实了
Those rumors were greatly exaggerated.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.370
我没有
No, I was, um...

09:47.540 --> 09:50.040
我被与公司的对着干的一个组织救了
...freed by a group working against the Company.

09:50.210 --> 09:52.920
你父亲成立的组织  我跟他们一起工作
The group founded by your father,I'm working with them.

09:53.090 --> 09:55.300
我从那时起就一直跟他们工作
Now I've been working with them ever since.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.010
可以帮我一把
Could have used a hand, Paul.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.550
我来了
Here I am.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.100
你拿到锡拉了吗
Do you have Scylla?

10:01.260 --> 10:02.550
你认为呢
What do you think?

10:02.720 --> 10:04.640
你拿到了
I think you do.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.600
我也知道警察和联邦局的人在找你
I also know that you're wanted by the police and the feds.

10:08.770 --> 10:11.940
现在说说将军和你母亲
Not to mention the general and your mother.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.820
她不成问题
She won't be a problem.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.940
今天5点钟有联合国的专员到迈阿密
There is a U.N. attaché who will be in Miami today at 5:00...

10:17.110 --> 10:18.820
从你那里拿走锡拉
...to receive Scylla from you.

10:18.990 --> 10:20.660
就这些吗
Is that so?

10:20.820 --> 10:24.120
他是联合国秘书长的首席顾问
He's chief counsel to the secretary general of the United Nations.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.910
秘书长了解锡拉项目
The secretary has been briefed on the Scylla program.

10:27.080 --> 10:31.500
他决定承担起责任  你只要把它交出来
He's prepared to assume responsibility.All you have to do is deliver it.

10:31.630 --> 10:34.590
我们需要摆脱将军
We need to stop the general from coming after our families.

10:34.710 --> 10:36.670
没问题  但你要安排这次见面
Fine, but you need to make this meeting.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.260
我为什么要相信你
Why should I trust a word coming from your mouth?

10:39.430 --> 10:43.100
一旦交出锡拉  你们的罪行就会一笔勾消
Once Scylla is delivered,your slate is wiped clean.

10:43.850 --> 10:44.890
你们所有人
All of you.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.770
你会自由
You're free.

10:47.350 --> 10:49.140
那不是答案
That's not an answer, Paul.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.610
毫不夸张地说  我猜你知道你拿的东西
I assume you know that what you have can--

10:53.770 --> 10:58.030
可以让世界变得更好
And this is no exaggeration.--change the world for the better.

10:58.820 --> 11:01.700
你只需要交出它
All you have to do is deliver it.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.580
你不用相信我  你只需要
And you don't need to trust me,just trust the people...

11:04.700 --> 11:06.740
相信联合国的工作人员
...that worked at the United Nations.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.670
手机没电了
Phone died.

11:14.130 --> 11:16.710
-他还没有好转  -来  我们把他扶起来
-He's not getting any better. -Come on. Let's get him up.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.510
-我去拿点用品  -好
-I gotta get some supplies.-Okay.

11:26.390 --> 11:28.350
弗罗斯特探员和巴格威尔都没有音信
No word from Agent Frost or Bagwell.

11:28.520 --> 11:32.230
那个滑头  要是他擅离职守  我活剥了他
That simpering little rat.If he's AWOL, I'll skin him alive.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.570
他不可能搞定弗罗斯特  他可能被抓或者死了
No way he got over on Frost,he's captured. Or dead.

11:36.690 --> 11:39.440
就是说我们暴露了
So we're exposed here.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.030
就这么结束了吗
This is the end.

11:42.530 --> 11:44.030
真是凄惨啊
Whimpering.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.740
我们可以撤走等待东山再起
There's no shame in retreating to regroup, sir.

11:48.330 --> 11:51.620
那可没那么简单
That, son, is a tremendous load.

11:54.710 --> 11:56.210
喂
Yeah.

11:59.590 --> 12:02.170
塔台发现林肯·布鲁斯的手机信号
Lincoln Burrows' phone.Pinged to cell tower downtown.

12:02.340 --> 12:03.380
我们找到他的位置了
We have his location.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.470
那你还愣着干嘛
Then what are you doing here?

12:14.940 --> 12:16.110
是
Yeah.

12:16.730 --> 12:18.230
好
Okay.

12:21.110 --> 12:22.440
是凯勒曼
And that was Kellerman.

12:22.610 --> 12:25.490
这个阿拉巴马拖车男干的好事
This Alabama trailer trash has been making good.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.620
你投奔了克兰兹将军
You hooked up with General Krantz.

12:27.740 --> 12:30.830
-管你什么事  光头  -将军现在在哪
-What is it to you, rug head? -Well, where is the general now?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.710
跟你爹在一个地方  没人知道
Same place as your daddy.Location unknown.

12:44.550 --> 12:48.390
还记得排队等饭那一天吗
Do you remember that day we were in the chow line?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.220
在福克斯河
Fox River.

12:50.390 --> 12:52.810
你对我的侮辱
You made that off-handed comment to me.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.100
我相信一定带了民族色彩
I believe it had a racial bent to it.

12:55.270 --> 12:56.480
说对了
Yeah.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.480
还记得你脱臼的下巴吗
Do you remember your broken jaw?

13:00.110 --> 13:03.860
现在赶快想出点事关生死的正经事
Now, just imagine what I can do to you now with something real on the line.

13:04.030 --> 13:05.400
比如
Such as?

13:05.570 --> 13:09.030
我们想要索菲、L.J.和帕姆·马宏安全
We want safety for Sofia, L.J.and Pam Mahone.

13:09.370 --> 13:11.740
也就是说我们需要知道将军的位置
That means we need the general's location.

13:11.910 --> 13:14.250
我会有什么好处
-What's in it for me?

13:14.410 --> 13:17.210
我们把锡拉交出
If we take Scylla to the place it's supposed to be...

13:17.380 --> 13:19.380
会有一个赦免名单
...there'll be an immunity list.

13:19.540 --> 13:20.590
可以有你的名字
You could be on it.

13:20.750 --> 13:24.470
我的阵营虽然稍占劣势
No, where I'm sitting,I'll be momentarily compromised.

13:24.630 --> 13:27.680
但你们站错队营了  斯科菲尔德搞不定的
You're backing the wrong horse.Scofield cannot pull this out.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.470
我们把他交给将军  我们一辈子就不用愁了
You help me get him to the general,we are set for life.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.430
我没时间废话
I don't have time for this, man.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.560
你应该抓紧时间站到赢的一方  黑鬼朋友
It's time you back the winner for once,my chocolate friend.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.520
坐下
Sit down.

13:39.690 --> 13:41.060
将军在哪
Now, where is the general?

13:45.820 --> 13:49.780
将军在哪
Now, where is the general?

13:56.160 --> 13:58.290
能挺住吗
You holding up?

14:00.540 --> 14:02.540
你要把锡拉交给凯勒曼吗
You're gonna give Scylla to Kellerman?

14:05.130 --> 14:08.180
不知道  你相信他吗
I don't know. Do you trust him?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.430
不相信
No.

14:12.220 --> 14:14.810
自由之身听上去很美
The thought of walking free from this sounds good.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.350
那是我们奋斗的目标
I mean, that was the goal.

14:16.980 --> 14:19.980
迪克兰广场  5点钟  街对面
Five o'clock, Declan Plaza.It's right across town.

14:22.980 --> 14:26.440
林肯  我不会离开你的  你是我的哥哥
I'm not leaving you, Linc.You're my brother.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.610
克里斯蒂娜可不这么想
Not according to Christina.

14:30.780 --> 14:32.950
别听她胡说八道
Don't let her mess with your head.

14:33.120 --> 14:37.080
也可能是事实
Oh, maybe it's true, you know.

14:37.250 --> 14:40.460
我一直回忆小时候的事
I keep playing things over my head from our childhood--

14:40.630 --> 14:42.380
她说什么无关紧要
It doesn't matter what she said.

14:42.540 --> 14:45.500
不会改变什么的
It doesn't change anything.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.510
不管你喜不喜欢  我都跟定你了
You are stuck with me whether you like it or not.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.850
他们在哪  这里吗
So where are they? Here?

14:59.810 --> 15:03.150
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯藏在迈阿密吗
Scofield and Burrows are hiding here in Miami?

15:03.860 --> 15:06.110
写下是哪条街

15:16.330 --> 15:18.870
医生说可以做CT扫描了  我们要把他带走了
Doc said the CT scan is free. We gotta take him now.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.290
不说哪都别想去
He stays till he talks.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.960
他比10分钟前的情况要糟  他不会说的
He's worse than he was 10 minutes ago, he won't talk.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.040
但你可以写出来
Yeah, but you can write, can't you?

15:25.210 --> 15:28.510
写下我要的信息  你会得到一流护理和退休金
So you give what I need and you'll get top-notch care and a pension.

15:28.670 --> 15:31.380
不然就等着
Or you can waste away in front of us...

15:31.550 --> 15:34.640
脑袋缩成花生吧
...until you have the brain capacity of a peanut.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.600
你自己选择
Your choice.

15:37.600 --> 15:42.600
去死吧

15:43.900 --> 15:46.570
冷静  冷静  好了  好了
All right, all right, all right, come on. That's enough.

15:46.730 --> 15:48.440
别管他了
Just leave him.

15:49.190 --> 15:51.570
冷静  好吗  冷静
Cool it, all right? Just cool it.

15:51.740 --> 15:53.530
-我没事  -他要做CT扫描了
-I'm good.  -He's gonna take a CT scan.

15:53.700 --> 15:54.910
你要待在这里
You're gonna stay here.

15:55.070 --> 15:56.330
-明白  -好吗
-Got it.  -All right?

15:56.490 --> 15:58.540
要团结
Bring it together.

16:50.090 --> 16:51.380
打扰一下
Excuse me.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.720
能问两句吗
May I speak to you for a second?

17:00.100 --> 17:01.310
我刚才
I was--

17:25.080 --> 17:28.000
阿历克斯被抓了  是联邦探员
Alex was arrested, federal agent.

17:28.170 --> 17:29.420
我们要把他救出来
We need to get him.

如果我们把锡拉交给凯勒曼
If we give Scylla to Kellerman...

17:32.510 --> 17:34.760
阿历克斯就会免罪  他没事的
...Alex gets exonerated, he's fine.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.800
他没事的
He's fine.

17:36.970 --> 17:40.300
要把脓水抽出来  减轻压力  帮助呼吸
We need to get the fluid out, ease the pressure, help him breathe.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.140
能握住吗
Can you hold that?

17:47.100 --> 17:49.020
撑不了很久  但不影响赶路
That won't last long but we can go.

17:56.820 --> 17:58.910
我来开吧
Mind if I drive?

18:08.040 --> 18:09.580
巴格威尔  T-Bag
The general, T-Bag...

18:10.540 --> 18:12.380
将军在哪
...where is he?

18:13.300 --> 18:17.010
在伊拉克我看到一些肮脏行径
You know, I saw some pretty nasty behavior in Iraq.

18:17.970 --> 18:19.470
很恶心
Disgusted me.

18:20.050 --> 18:24.430
我背叛了指挥官  结果惹了一身麻烦
I ratted at the chain of command and it got me a whole world of trouble.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.020
不是什么善事吧
No good deed, eh?

18:29.150 --> 18:31.560
所以我们也要
So the fact that we are about to get busy...

18:31.730 --> 18:35.610
干跟毁了我事业一样的事了
...with some of that same stuff that ruined my career...

18:36.690 --> 18:38.280
我会这样做的
...the irony doesn't escape me.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.320
你们好好想想
Hell, as long as you got your thinking cap on...

18:41.490 --> 18:44.740
到底谁更有赢的把握
...why don't you consider who's really the one in power?

18:49.830 --> 18:51.750
是我们
We are.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.800
满脸憔悴  伤痕累累
Battered and bruised.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.430
死神逼近
Staring death in the face.

19:01.590 --> 19:05.890
居然还不见棺材不落泪
Surprising that you need more assurance that you've come to the end of the line.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.600
锡拉不在我们手上
We don't have Scylla.

19:08.390 --> 19:10.190
迈克
Michael...

19:10.350 --> 19:12.650
你哥哥危在旦夕
...your brother is dying.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.610
看他脸上的血色一点点消失
It's fascinating...

19:17.740 --> 19:20.860
可真迷人啊
...to watch the blood drain from his face.

19:21.780 --> 19:26.120
你认为他想看到同样的事发生在女朋友身上吗
Do you suppose that he would like to see that happen to his girlfriend?

19:36.090 --> 19:38.000
索菲
Sofia.

19:40.930 --> 19:47.810
要不给我锡拉  要不看着索菲被割喉
You give me Scylla or he can sit there and watch as Sofia's throat is slit.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.060
两分钟内
In two minutes...

19:56.190 --> 20:00.440
你的眼球会爆炸
...you're eyeballs are gonna pop out of your head.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.740
那比死还难受啊
Now, that's worse than death.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.950
我不能背叛
I can't betray.

20:08.700 --> 20:11.960
我注定要
My destiny is to be...

20:12.120 --> 20:15.080
成为一个令人敬仰的绅士
...a respected gentleman.

20:15.210 --> 20:18.420
你个混蛋  将军在哪
Where's the general,you son of a bitch?

20:20.130 --> 20:21.510
表可是在转哦
Clock's ticking.

20:29.930 --> 20:33.770
鲁格迷你14  口径223  杀死纳温·巴纳及的枪上

20:36.690 --> 20:39.480
监控上看到你和布鲁斯在案发现场溜达
We have video of you outside the crime scene with Burrows.

20:39.650 --> 20:40.980
难道不能是巧合吗
Isn't that a coincidence?

20:42.450 --> 20:45.780
我没有见过比当·赛尔夫更丢人的事了
You know, I never thought I'd see a bigger disgrace than Don Self...

20:45.950 --> 20:48.240
-但你瞧啊  -你不知道
-...but lo and behold. -You have no idea...

20:48.410 --> 20:51.870
-你到底在说什么  -但我看得到
-...what you're talking about. -Yeah, I got eyes, don't I?

20:52.040 --> 20:55.370
你以前获过勋章  但现在你却教唆谋杀他人
You had a badge and now you're abetting an assassination.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.460
林肯没杀巴纳及
Lincoln didn't kill Banarjee.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.550
他是被陷害的
He was set up.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.210
谁陷害他
Well, then by whom?

21:12.180 --> 21:14.140
公司
It was the Company.

21:14.270 --> 21:16.230
公司  明白我的意思吗
Company, you know what I'm talking about?

21:16.400 --> 21:18.690
他们发明了一种叫做锡拉的设备
They've developed a device that's called Scylla.

21:18.860 --> 21:21.320

Wait, no, can we just stop for two seconds, please?

21:21.480 --> 21:23.570
叫做锡拉的设备
Device called Scylla? Ha, ha.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.820
马宏  我们现在在哪个星球
What planet are we on now, Mahone?

21:25.990 --> 21:29.910
如果你想重见光明  把斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯交出来
If you wanna see the light of day as a free man, give us Scofield and Burrows.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.370
你们把黑白颠倒了
You're missing what's right in front of your face.

21:33.540 --> 21:36.370
他们兄弟俩没杀人
The brothers didn't kill anybody.

21:38.580 --> 21:41.670
你们不是说想伸张正义吗
You say you're here because you wanna do the right thing?

21:41.840 --> 21:43.170
那就听我说
Then listen to me.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.720
相信我说的话
Listen to what I'm telling you.

21:47.220 --> 21:50.050
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯
Scofield and Burrows...

21:50.220 --> 21:52.430
他们在哪
...where are they?

21:54.640 --> 21:56.100
索菲
Sofia.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.440
就算是生死决择
Granted, it is a fretful decision.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.440
你们也考虑地够久了
But you pondered it long enough.

22:02.610 --> 22:03.860
我在你手上
You have me.

22:04.030 --> 22:07.820
林肯  你算什么  我只想要属于我的东西
I don't really care about you, Lincoln.I just want my property.

22:07.990 --> 22:11.910
好吧  就当我知道它在哪  我凭什么告诉你
All right. Let's say I do know where it is,why should I tell you?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.700
说不说你都是要杀我们
You're just gonna kill us anyway.

22:13.870 --> 22:16.830
没错  你们兄弟俩横竖都是死
True. You and your brother are walking dead...

22:17.000 --> 22:20.500
但如果我能在半小时内拿到锡拉
...but if I get Scylla within the next half hour...

22:20.670 --> 22:22.250
我会放了索菲
...I'll release Sofia.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.380
那莎拉呢
And what about Sara?

22:26.340 --> 22:29.050
我们现在只谈索菲
We're negotiating for Sofia right now.

22:29.220 --> 22:32.350
-我要你放了她  -迈克  那就快决定
-I want you to let her go. -And I want a decision, Michael.

22:32.510 --> 22:33.970
放她走
Let her go!

22:40.810 --> 22:42.310
好了
All right.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.730
别动
Don't move.

22:52.700 --> 22:53.830
放了索菲
Let Sofia go.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.990
马上就放  打电话
Now. Make the call.

23:05.420 --> 23:07.420
放她走
Just let her walk away.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.510
是  马上
Yes, immediately.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.150

-Kill him. -No. We leave.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.570
-迈克  听她的  -杀了他
-Listen to her, Michael. -Kill him.

23:34.740 --> 23:37.120
我只是个一无所有的
I'm just an old man.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.830
糟老头
Who's lost everything.

23:39.830 --> 23:42.040
迈克  你赢了
You win, Michael.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.670
还有你  林肯
And you, Lincoln.

23:43.830 --> 23:46.090
迈克  你赢了
You win, Michael.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.050
你们都赢了
You both win.

23:48.210 --> 23:50.840
这就是一场游戏  不是吗
Because it's all just a game, isn't it?

23:51.010 --> 23:53.510
迈克  当你像我一样老时
When you get to be as old as I am,Michael...

23:53.680 --> 23:56.510
如果你能活那么长
...should you survive so long...

23:56.680 --> 24:00.310
你也会发现这就是一场游戏
...you, too, will see that that's exactly what all this is.

24:00.430 --> 24:01.640
杀了他
Kill him.

24:01.810 --> 24:03.690
听我说
Listen to me.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.400
听我说
Just listen to me.

24:06.570 --> 24:10.070
我冒着危险来这不是为了报复
I didn't risk everything to come down here for our revenge.

24:13.740 --> 24:16.370
我是为了洗刷清白
I'm here to clear my name.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.580
锡拉还在不
Do you have Scylla?

24:23.790 --> 24:25.540
在
Yes.

24:27.130 --> 24:28.380
那我们走吧
Then let's go.

24:35.010 --> 24:37.100
走吧  将军
Come on, general.

24:41.060 --> 24:43.640
从没料到见到你会如此兴奋
Never thought I'd be so happy to see you.

24:43.810 --> 24:45.400
-告诉我  -什么
-Tell me something. -Yeah.

24:45.900 --> 24:48.570
你确定凯勒曼可以信任吗
Are you sure we can trust Kellerman?

24:48.730 --> 24:52.110
我们别无选择
You know the only thing I'm sure of is that he's our last option.

24:53.150 --> 24:54.650
先生们  该走了
Gentlemen, we gotta leave.

24:56.780 --> 24:58.410
快点  我们走
Come on. Let's go.

25:33.940 --> 25:35.900
等等我
Wait for me.

25:46.830 --> 25:49.170

Freeze or I'll shoot.

25:53.130 --> 25:55.130
走  快走
Go, go.

25:55.670 --> 25:57.340
迈克  开车
Michael, go.

26:21.530 --> 26:24.120
再不去医院  他就撑不住了
He's not gonna make it much longer without a hospital.

26:24.290 --> 26:26.120
等这一切结束再说
No. Not till this is done.

26:26.290 --> 26:28.870
林肯  林肯
Linc. Linc.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.170
