I was set up.

00:08.070 --> 00:10.200
把枪放下

00:31.600 --> 00:32.870
证据确凿
The evidence was cooked.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.240

只要不在这儿
Not be here.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.540
精神病院?
Halfway houses.

03:54.550 --> 03:58.010

Urine tests. Keeping a job.

04:01.740 --> 04:03.610

No.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.500
为什么这么问?
Why'd you ask?

04:05.510 --> 04:09.110

04:09.120 --> 04:11.290
告诉贝利克长官

04:32.150 --> 04:35.360

Yeah.

05:18.670 --> 05:20.650
为了把我变成白痴
To keep me dull.

05:20.660 --> 05:24.400
用一双无形的手铐锁住我
To keep me in their invisible freaking handcuffs.

05:24.410 --> 05:27.420
不过说真的  那纹身真不错
Seriously. Those tattoos,they're beautiful.

05:27.430 --> 05:30.610
介意我完整的看看么?
You mind if I,you know,look at the whole thing?

05:30.620 --> 05:33.600
事实上  我介意
I do,actually.

05:33.610 --> 05:34.910
为什么?
Why?

05:34.920 --> 05:37.140
你 站开
Yo. Stand clear.

05:37.150 --> 05:40.410
需要理由么?
Does there need to be a reason?

05:47.060 --> 05:48.830
苏克雷

05:48.840 --> 05:51.720
我不能和你说话  伙计

What's the problem?

06:32.540 --> 06:34.180

06:34.190 --> 06:35.880
我知道有事

06:35.890 --> 06:39.530
我在院子那头就看出事情有些不对了
I could tell by looking at you from across the yard.

06:39.540 --> 06:43.000
伙计们  我就说有事情不对吧?
Guys,didn't I say there was a problem?

06:43.010 --> 06:45.500
到底是怎么回事?
So what's the problem?

06:45.510 --> 06:48.340
你自己看
You're looking at it.

06:48.620 --> 06:49.790
什么? 海威尔?
What,Haywire?

06:49.800 --> 06:53.400
没错  我的新狱友
Yup. He's my new cell mate.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.840
这就有问题了
That's a problem.

06:54.850 --> 06:55.980
他从不睡觉
He doesn't sleep.

06:55.990 --> 06:57.390
那你都什么时候挖?
So when do you dig?

06:57.400 --> 06:59.330
我没法挖
I don't.

06:59.340 --> 07:02.680
嘿  咱俩现在可是在一条船上

07:02.690 --> 07:03.820
你答应过我
You made me a promise.

07:03.830 --> 07:06.770
你说过咱们会逃出去的
You said that we were gonna get out of here.

07:06.780 --> 07:10.330
要是食言  我就宰了你
You renege now,and I'm gonna cut you.

07:10.340 --> 07:12.890
你好自为之吧
You better take care of your business.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.730
要不然我就给你好看
Or I will take care of you.

07:15.740 --> 07:18.910
祝你今天过得愉快
Have a nice day.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.610
真的能弄好么?
It's really coming together,isn't it?

08:08.620 --> 08:09.870
是的
Yup.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.530
能按时完工?
You think it'll be done in time?

08:11.540 --> 08:15.260
虽然我觉得里面要是 再有个凉亭会好一些
Well,I figure we still have the interior alcoves.

08:15.270 --> 08:17.530
而且柱子的工作量也不小
Pilasters to do,which is no small task.

08:17.540 --> 08:22.260
但是  我想按时完工没问题
But,yes. I think so.

08:22.270 --> 08:24.160
我不得不说  我...
Listen,I have to say I

08:24.170 --> 08:28.950
你为我所做的我真是感激不尽
I really appreciate all the effort that you put into this.

08:28.960 --> 08:34.140
真希望有什么能补偿你 比如付你工钱 或是...
I wish there was some way I could,you know,pay you,or something.

08:34.150 --> 08:37.890
有件事还真要请您帮忙
There is one thing you could do for me.

08:38.170 --> 08:39.940
我的狱友
My cell mate.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.550
啊 那个不用睡觉的疯子?
The inimitable Charles Patoshik.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.530
海威尔?
Haywire?

08:43.540 --> 08:45.230
原来你知道
Then you know.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.590
你就忍忍吧
Hold it right there.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.580
贝利克长官负全权责犯人的调度
Officer Bellick is in charge of cell transfers.

08:49.590 --> 08:51.630
你得找他商量商量
You're gonna have to talk to him about that.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.950
我试过  他好像认为我俩是天生的一对
I tried. But he seems to think we're a good match.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.090
他威胁到你了没有?
Has he threatened you?

08:56.100 --> 08:59.880
谁  海威尔还是贝利克?
Who? Haywire or Bellick?

08:59.890 --> 09:03.690
不幸的是  除非能证明有暴力
Unfortunately,unless there's some evidence of violence.

09:03.700 --> 09:06.970
或者性侵犯事件发生在你们之间
or sexual predation between cell mates.

09:06.980 --> 09:11.200
其余的请求一般是不予受理的
those kinds of requests fall on deaf ears around here.

09:11.210 --> 09:16.140
监狱里可没人有时间来管 什么性格不和之类的事情
Prison system's a little too crowded for requests based on personality.

09:16.150 --> 09:20.030
这里可不是什么度假胜地
It's not exactly Sandals out there.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.400
监狱长?
Warden?

09:23.410 --> 09:25.810
不好意思  您妻子来了

 She's not supposed to be here till four o'clock.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.800
贝蒂  无论如何也不能让她进来这里
Becky,do not let her come in here under any circumstances.

09:33.810 --> 09:36.220
不能在结婚纪念日之前让她看到这个
She's not supposed to see this until our anniversary.

09:36.230 --> 09:38.770
我这就出去
I'll be right out.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.490
嗨  亲爱的
Hi,sweetheart.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.900
来这么早
You're early.

09:47.910 --> 09:50.470

Let's go eat.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.340
你看起来怎么这么滑稽?
You're acting funny.

09:52.350 --> 09:53.100
有么?
I am?

09:53.110 --> 09:54.670
里面到底在干什么?
What's going on in there?

09:54.680 --> 09:57.700
只是在看一些文件
Just going over some files.

09:57.710 --> 10:00.440
贝蒂说你在开会
Becky said you were in a meeting.

10:00.450 --> 10:04.330
不会又是托莱多事件吧?
This isn't Toledo all over again,is it?

10:04.340 --> 10:05.940
托莱多?
Toledo?

10:05.950 --> 10:07.970
怎么可能?
How can you say that?

10:07.980 --> 10:09.640
那就不介意我进去看一下了
Then you won't mind if I look.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.090
朱蒂
Uh,Judy...

10:12.550 --> 10:15.450
监狱长  我没法再继续合作下去了
Warden,I'm not gonna be able to cooperate.

10:15.460 --> 10:18.320
再这样下去  我会被杀死的
I'd get killed if I did.

10:18.330 --> 10:21.680
约翰逊还在考虑
Johnson's still deciding.

10:21.690 --> 10:24.610
好 没你事了
Then you and I are done.

10:26.950 --> 10:29.120
你该早点告诉我
You should have just told me.

10:29.130 --> 10:32.500
每当你接触犯人的时候  你知道我有多紧张
Well,you know how anxious I get when you come around the inmates.

10:32.510 --> 10:35.310
贝蒂  叫警卫把约翰逊押回牢房
Becky,have a guard escort Johnson back to his cell.

10:35.320 --> 10:39.590
我稍后再处理 走吧  咱们吃饭去
I'll deal with him later.Come on,let's eat.

10:54.510 --> 10:55.880
你来这里干嘛?
What are you doing here?

10:55.890 --> 10:58.370
我是你的律师
I'm your attorney.

10:58.650 --> 11:02.340
代理你的案件
I'm representing you now.

11:02.950 --> 11:06.490
如果你不介意的话
If that's all right with you.

11:07.330 --> 11:09.980
上次我见到你时 还说我是个骗子
Last time I saw you,you called me a liar.

11:09.990 --> 11:12.200
世事难料
Things have changed.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.990
我现在相信你了
I believe you now.

11:26.960 --> 11:32.110
我和克拉博·西蒙斯 的前女友莱提莎谈过了
I got in touch with Crab Simmons' ex-girlfriend,Leticia.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.900
她证实了你的事情
She corroborated your story.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.690
她会作证么?
Will she testify?

11:37.700 --> 11:40.050
她失踪了
She's missing.

11:40.060 --> 11:42.700
我也说不好  我认为她被特情局盯上了
I don't know.I think the Secret Service got to her.

11:42.710 --> 11:43.930
特情局?
Secret Service?

11:43.940 --> 11:45.470
他们也牵扯进来了
They've been poking around.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.330
他们一出现  她就消失了 你怎么看?
They show up,she disappears.What do you think happenned?

11:48.340 --> 11:54.190
我没想到能牵扯到高层
I didn't realise it was that high up,you know?

11:54.690 --> 11:56.620
你知道我们面对的是什么人么?
Do you know what we're up against?

11:56.630 --> 12:00.770
我只知道凭借咱们中的 任何一个人都应付不了的
I know it's a lot more than either of us can handle on our own.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.890
司法公正处
Project Justice.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.390
好像听说过?
Why have I heard of them?

12:04.400 --> 12:06.190
命案都是他们处理
They handle death penalty cases.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.690
那里有个叫本·福斯克的
There's a guy,Ben Forsik.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.480
我把我所有掌握资料的拷贝都给他了
I sent him copies of everything I had.

12:09.490 --> 12:10.880
你到那说明一下情况
You could tell him what you found.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.780
或许他会帮助咱们
Maybe it'll be enough to bring him on board.

12:13.790 --> 12:16.330
好的
OK.

12:18.340 --> 12:22.490
塞巴斯蒂安怎么样了?
So,uh,how's Sebastian?

12:22.870 --> 12:25.170
你指什么?
What do you mean?

12:25.180 --> 12:30.690
你来这里找我  我是说 他不会介意吧?
Well,you being here.I mean,is he cool with it?

12:31.110 --> 12:35.180
我没告诉他
I haven't talked to him.

12:37.330 --> 12:39.970
婚约解除了
The engagement's off.

12:39.980 --> 12:43.960
真对不起
Sorry.

12:43.970 --> 12:47.410
你最好真是那么想的
You could at least say that like you mean it.

12:47.420 --> 12:49.580
真的
I do.

12:50.510 --> 12:55.300
你真是个差劲的说谎者
God,you always were a lousy liar.

12:55.910 --> 12:58.160
是的
Yeah.

12:59.770 --> 13:02.850
我还是去找司法公正处吧
I better get to Project Justice.

13:11.650 --> 13:12.420
维罗妮卡?
Veronica?

13:16.850 --> 13:19.090
多谢
Thank you.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.940
我剩下的时间不多了
 I didn't have a whole lot.

13:20.950 --> 13:24.780
等你出来后再谢我也不迟
You can thank me when I get you out of here.

13:40.980 --> 13:43.930
宝贝  是我  你在么?
Baby,it's me. Are you there?

13:43.940 --> 13:45.630
喂? 你在么?
Hello? Are you there?

13:45.640 --> 13:50.520
嘿  就算她在  她也显然不想理你
Hey. If she is,she obviously don't want to talk to you.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.660
今天是星期三  宝贝儿
It's Wednesday,babe.

13:53.670 --> 13:56.440
你会来看我的  对么?
You were gonna come around today,right?

13:56.450 --> 13:58.080
好吧  我得挂了
Look,I gotta hang up now.

13:58.090 --> 13:59.990
我得回去了
I gotta go back in the block.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.080
你会来的  对么?
but...you're gonna be here today,right?

14:03.090 --> 14:05.910
不要忘了我  亲爱的  我爱你
I'm your man,baby,and I love you.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.750
永远爱你
I do.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.610
像是某个地方
It's a pattern.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.020
你说什么?
What did you say?

14:27.030 --> 14:29.430
你的纹身...像是某个地方
Your tattoo. It's a pattern.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.410
你看错了
You're seeing things.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.800
让他和海威尔住在一起的是下策
Putting him in with Haywire is a low blow.

14:41.810 --> 14:45.330
什么? 他已经没事了
What? The shrinks cleared Haywire for re-entry into Gen Pop.

14:45.340 --> 14:48.080
而且他每天都会吃药  简直就像小猫一样乖
He's so doped up on meds he's like a kitten.

14:48.090 --> 14:50.030
一只杀死亲生父母的小猫
A kitten who murdered both his parents.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.390
出于尊敬  长官
With respect,sir.

14:51.400 --> 14:56.430
您要是再给斯科菲尔德特权的话 会影响到您的信誉的
If you give Scofield preferential treatment,it'll undermine your credibility.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.910
我知道您偏爱他  因为他很有头脑
I know you got a so spot for the guy because he's got brains.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.380
并且能帮您弄那个玩意儿
And he's helping you with that contraption.

15:02.390 --> 15:04.420
但他是个有暴力倾向的罪犯
But the guy's a violent criminal.

15:04.430 --> 15:07.080
正如其他的犯人一样 受到惩罚是罪有应得
He deserves punishment as much as the rest of these guys.

15:07.090 --> 15:08.600
你来这么久了也该知道
You've been here long you've to know that.

15:08.610 --> 15:11.600
我是感化重于惩罚
I'm less interested in punishment than I am in rehabilitation.

15:11.610 --> 15:15.460
把他和海威尔放在一起不是我的作风
And sticking him in with Haywire is not rehabilitation in my book.

15:15.470 --> 15:18.120
老板 是您授权我负责调配犯人的
You delegated authority over Gen Pop to me,boss.

15:18.130 --> 15:19.060
这我知道
I know I did.

15:19.070 --> 15:21.790
那您就让我做自己的工作 或者让别人来做好了
You gotta let me do my job or pass it on somebody else.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.200
布赖恩  别激动
Now,Brian,go easy.

15:24.210 --> 15:29.100
我赋予你越来越多的责任是有原因的
There's a reason I'm giving you more and more responsibility.

15:29.750 --> 15:34.980
我退休后  是要推荐你来坐我的位子的
When I retire,I'm recommending you to take my place.

15:34.990 --> 15:37.780
别让我后悔
Don't make me regret it.

15:37.790 --> 15:40.970
我想说的是  再考虑一下斯科菲尔德的情况
All I'm saying is,take another look at the Scofield situation.

15:40.980 --> 15:43.990
我相信你的判断
I trust your judgment.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.930
是的  长官
Yes,sir.

15:57.780 --> 15:59.380
喂  喂  等一下  等一下
Hold up.

15:59.390 --> 16:01.580
今天不是开放探亲日么 我们来这儿做什么?
This is supposed to be an open visitation. Why we doing it here?

16:01.590 --> 16:04.470
去问你的访客
Ask your visitor.

16:09.740 --> 16:12.010
你来这儿干嘛? 玛丽克鲁兹呢?
What are you doing here? Where's Maricruz?

16:12.020 --> 16:14.670
她以后再也不会来了
She's not gonna be coming any more.

16:14.680 --> 16:15.760
她病了?
Is she hurt?

16:15.770 --> 16:20.010
不  没有  她很好  好极了  她只是...
No,no,she's fine,she's fine.She's just,uh...

16:22.320 --> 16:24.580
她现在和我在一起了
She's with me now.

16:24.590 --> 16:26.600
和你在一起?
She's with you now?

16:26.610 --> 16:27.870
别逗了?
It's ajoke,right?

16:27.880 --> 16:29.440
不  她已经决定了  伙计
No,she made a decision,man.

16:29.450 --> 16:31.620
她选择了稳定的生活
She decided she needed stability.

16:31.630 --> 16:32.720
她能从你那里得到么?
Is she gonna get that from you?

16:32.730 --> 16:37.740
听着 你看 不管你怎么看我 但是...
You can think what you want about me but...

16:37.750 --> 16:39.970
我至少没坐牢
I'm not the one who's in prison.

16:39.980 --> 16:41.990
明白么
See?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.460
至少在某方面我能为她做点什么
I actually can do something for her.

16:45.470 --> 16:49.780
她让我先来这里和你谈谈 免得你失去理智
She wanted me to talk to you first in case you got mad...

16:57.420 --> 17:01.520
你和我想的一样
You just proved my point.

17:01.530 --> 17:08.140
你是个犯人  一辈子都是
You're a con.And that's all you'll ever be.

17:25.490 --> 17:28.730
抓紧时间
Make it quick.

17:56.530 --> 17:58.990
没错  他的确在这里
Yeah. He's right in here.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.750
走开  乔奇
Take a walk,Choppy.

18:06.090 --> 18:08.580
斯科菲尔德
Scofield.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.260
这里是禁区
You're in a restricted area.

18:11.270 --> 18:14.640
我正在院子里做狱工  我们需要些肥料
I'm doing yard work for PI.We need some fertiliser.

18:14.650 --> 18:18.240
那你来工料区干什么?
Then why are you in the masonry section?

18:28.170 --> 18:32.340
对了  你的脚怎么样了?
Oh,by the way,how's the foot?

18:39.490 --> 18:43.940
不要再背着我去找监狱长了
Don't ever go around me to the Pope again.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.820
滚吧
Now,move.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.500
你知道么  海威尔?
You know what,Haywire?

19:10.510 --> 19:13.500
我觉得咱们无法相处
I don't think we're gonna work out.

19:14.620 --> 19:19.460
既然是我先来这里的 我觉得该走的是你
And since I was here first,I think you should go.

19:20.360 --> 19:24.230
高中时有一次我拉屎在裤子上
I crapped myself once in junior high.

19:24.650 --> 19:25.800
在上体育课的时候
During PE,

19:25.810 --> 19:28.400
当时我们在打羽毛球
we were playing badminton,

19:28.410 --> 19:31.640
我要从很多同学身边经过
and I knew I had to walk past a bunch of the other students

19:31.650 --> 19:34.440
你知道  我要回更衣室
to get back to the locker room,

19:34.450 --> 19:36.610
于是...
and so

19:36.620 --> 19:38.870
我走了过去
I just started walking.

19:38.880 --> 19:43.460
想找点乐子  做点别人从未做过的事情
And I tried to make fun of it,you know,before anyone else did.

19:43.470 --> 19:45.980
我转过身...
So I turned around behind me,

19:45.990 --> 19:49.630
然后说 "看那  我长尾巴了"
and I said,"Look,I have a tail."

19:55.680 --> 19:58.280
我告诉了你我的秘密
I just shared a secret with you.

19:58.290 --> 19:59.820
现在轮到你了
Now it's your turn.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.620
想知道纹身画的是什么?
You want to know what the tattoos mean?

20:01.630 --> 20:04.560
-没错  -什么也不是
-Yeah.  -Nothing.

20:08.220 --> 20:10.650
嘿  嫩鸡
Hey,fish.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.360
有什么进展么?
Making any progress?

20:14.370 --> 20:17.920
你指和那个睡美人还是挖地道?
With Sleeping Beauty back there?Or with the digging?

20:17.930 --> 20:19.050
都有
Either.

20:19.060 --> 20:21.120
没进展
No.

20:21.130 --> 20:23.140
但我知道该怎么做了
But I know what to do.

20:23.150 --> 20:25.030
噢  真的么?
Oh,yeah?

20:25.040 --> 20:32.290
只可惜  你没这个胆
Problem is,you don't got the stugots to do it.

20:35.590 --> 20:38.530
阿布鲁奇  快走
Abruzzi,let's go.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.470
回见
See ya.

20:52.520 --> 20:53.380
真的么?
Yeah? Really?

20:53.390 --> 20:55.080
替我向那个婊子养的问好
Well,tell the crazy son of a bitch I said hi.

20:55.090 --> 20:55.750
时间到了
Wrap it up.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.690
鲁思姑妈怎么样? 出院了没有?
How's Aunt Ruth? She out of hospital?

20:57.700 --> 21:00.050
－时间到了  -等一下  妈妈
-Wrap it up.  -Hold on,Ma.

21:00.060 --> 21:02.560
咬我嘛
Bite me.

21:03.300 --> 21:05.810
看来你有麻烦了  伙计
OK. We got a problem now,man.

21:05.820 --> 21:09.010
老子随便你
Let's handle it then.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.450
没屁眼的杂种
That's what I thought.

21:18.460 --> 21:19.420
喂?
Hello?

21:19.430 --> 21:22.880
玛丽克鲁兹  是我  亲爱的 到底是怎么回事?
Maricruz? It's me.What's going on?

21:22.890 --> 21:24.300
你和赫克托到底是怎么回事?
What's the deal with you and Hector?

21:24.310 --> 21:25.750
你还打算瞒我多久?
When were you gonna tell me?

21:25.760 --> 21:26.500
我瞒你什么了?
What?

21:26.510 --> 21:28.970
丽塔·桑德拉去看过你了
That Rita Salda? A's been visiting you.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.320
什么? 没错  赫克托告诉我的
What?  Yeah. Hector told me.

21:31.330 --> 21:33.370
赫克托告诉你的 赫克托告诉你的
Hector told you.Hector told you.

21:33.380 --> 21:36.010
他当然会这么说了 他是条毒蛇  是个骗子
Of course he told you.Baby,that guy is a snake. He's a liar.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.510
他为什么要撒谎?
Why would he lie?

21:37.520 --> 21:39.640
他为什么要骗你? 因为他想要占有你
Why would he lie?Because he's been trying to get into your pants

21:39.650 --> 21:42.810
自从我们开始约会时他就那样了  这就是原因
since the minute we started dating.That's why.

21:42.820 --> 21:44.740
你知道么?
You know what?

21:44.750 --> 21:46.460
我不知道该去相信谁
I don't know what to believe.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.600
我 亲爱的 相信我
Me,mami. Believe me.

21:48.610 --> 21:51.460
是的  每周在电话旁等候两次
Yeah,while I wait by the phone twice a week.

21:51.470 --> 21:53.960
亲爱的  你这是怎么了?
Baby,where is this coming from?

21:53.970 --> 21:56.780
我也不知道
I don't know.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.590
听着 最近发生了很多事
Look,there's just so many things.

22:02.150 --> 22:05.290
昨天 我去找特里萨
Yesterday I went to Teresa's house,

22:05.300 --> 22:07.800
看到她的宝宝
and I saw her baby.

22:07.810 --> 22:10.840
就因为这个? 你等不及了么?
Is that what this is about?Your clock is ticking?

22:10.850 --> 22:13.740
再过几年我就30岁了
Well,I am gonna be 30 in a few years.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.360
亲爱的  你才25岁
You're 25.

22:15.370 --> 22:17.580
你想要孩子? 咱们现在就可以
You want to get pregnant?Let's get pregnant right now.

22:17.590 --> 22:19.480
亲爱的 你知道我不能在婚前怀孕的
I can't get pregnant until I'm married.

22:19.490 --> 22:21.600
咱们会结婚的
We're gonna get married.

22:21.610 --> 22:24.680
16个月后
In 16 months.

22:26.870 --> 22:31.220
但是赫克托说  如果再出什么问题的话
Yeah,well,Hector says that if something goes wrong in there,

22:31.230 --> 22:35.490
很可能会服全刑
you could serve your full sentence.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.860
我可等不了10年
I can't wait ten years.

22:37.870 --> 22:40.530
我不能再等10年啊  亲爱的
I can't wait ten years,baby.

22:40.540 --> 22:44.820
再有16个月我就会出去了
I'm gonna be out in 16 months.

22:45.440 --> 22:48.050
那要是再出什么差错呢?
But what if something does happen,huh?

22:48.060 --> 22:51.200
亲爱的  我等不了那么久的
Baby,I can't wait that long.

22:52.730 --> 22:55.520
我不能
I can't.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.730
对不起  我得挂了
I'm sorry,I gotta go.

22:58.740 --> 23:02.950
亲爱的...喂...
Hello? Baby,wait... Hello?

23:12.780 --> 23:14.270
即使莱提莎·巴里斯肯出庭作证
Even if Leticia turned up,

23:14.280 --> 23:16.090
她的证词也不会起太大的作用
her testimony would be worthless.

23:16.100 --> 23:20.530
大多数有前科的瘾君子的证词是没人信的
By and large,most junkies with criminal records don't shine on the stand.

23:20.540 --> 23:23.040
我只找到了这些证据
I just found all this out in the past couple days.

23:23.050 --> 23:25.200
但我有信心能查出更多的
I'm confident I can find out more

23:25.210 --> 23:27.600
我在这个案子上会全力以赴的
now that I'm devoting all my time to the case.

23:27.610 --> 23:30.940
莱提莎在你办公室时特情局特工来过了
The agent who came to visit when Leticia was in your office,

23:30.950 --> 23:32.110
他想要干嘛?
what did he want?

23:32.120 --> 23:34.610
尼克  不要这样 你应该能理解的  多诺万女士
Nick,please. You've got to understand,

23:34.620 --> 23:37.010
除非你能提供一些新的线索
unless there's new information for us,

23:37.020 --> 23:40.260
布伦斯先生的案子我们已经审查过了
we've already reviewed Mr Burrows' case thoroughly.

23:40.270 --> 23:42.570
你还能提供其他的证据么?
Do you have any new evidence?

23:42.580 --> 23:43.430
不能  但是我...
No,but I...

23:43.440 --> 23:44.450
但是...
But.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.590
我想知道到底是有还是没有?
That is what you're telling us,right?

23:46.600 --> 23:47.980
我需要确定一下
I need to clarify here.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.450
是的 这正是我要说的
Yes. That is what I'm telling you.

23:50.460 --> 23:53.020
但是福斯克先生 你不用一味的强调我没有证据
But,Mr Forsik,you don't need to point out what I don't have.

23:53.030 --> 23:55.150
这点我很清楚
I'm well aware of that.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.620
我来这是想寻求你的帮助的
I'm asking for your help.

23:56.630 --> 24:00.460
我不想让一个无辜的人 为从未做过的事而承担死刑
I don't think a man should be killed for something he didn't do.

24:00.470 --> 24:03.770
我相信这也是你们大厅里的那个宣言
That's what it says on your mission statement in the lobby.

24:03.780 --> 24:06.300
我们有上万个诉讼请求需要受理
We get many requests for representation.

24:06.310 --> 24:07.130
这点我知道
I'm sure you do...

24:07.140 --> 24:08.120
我需要知道  哪些案件
And I have to decide which cases

24:08.130 --> 24:11.440
是我们有能力做的
we're going to devote our limited resources to.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.740
跑腿的活就让我来吧  福斯克先生
I will do all of the legwork,Mr Forsik,

24:13.750 --> 24:16.120
但我在处理死刑犯的案件上没有经验
but with no experience in death penalty cases,

24:16.130 --> 24:20.710
我只是恳请您能指点我一下
I'm just asking you to point me in the right direction.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.500
求你了
Please.

24:25.510 --> 24:27.270
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

24:27.280 --> 24:31.580
我们实在没有人手来管
We just don't have the manpower.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.620
打扰您了
Thank you for your time.

24:50.630 --> 24:53.250
她刚走
She's just leaving now.

24:53.260 --> 24:57.790
这种交通下她到家至少还需半个小时
It'll take her a half-hour to get across town in this traffic.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.430
用不了那么久
We're not gonna need nearly that much time.

25:05.550 --> 25:10.330
我想我找到了
I've turned up quite a bit already.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.450
嘿  你看到我的牙膏了么?
Hey. Hey,have you seen my toothpaste?

25:20.460 --> 25:21.820
就放这儿了
It was right here.

25:21.830 --> 25:23.340
没见过
I haven't seen it.

25:23.350 --> 25:25.610
我总是放在同一个地方的
I always put it in the same place.

25:25.620 --> 25:28.890
肯定能找到的
I'm sure it'll turn up.

26:09.450 --> 26:12.270
那个纹身  是个迷宫
The tattoos - there's a maze.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.040
离我远点
Get away from me.

26:14.050 --> 26:17.800
我只是想看看...让我看一下 我简直为它着迷
I need to see 'em.You gotta show 'em to me.It's pulling me in.

26:17.810 --> 26:22.410
我说了... 离我远点
I said,get away from me.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.590
好的
OK.

26:27.600 --> 26:31.390
他在身上纹了个迷宫图
He's got a maze on his skin.

26:32.740 --> 26:36.010
是的  他在身上纹了个迷宫图
Man's got a maze on his skin.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.030
为什么呢?
Why?

26:40.040 --> 26:43.230
他为什么要这样做呢? 为什么?
Why would he do that? Why?

26:43.240 --> 26:47.500
他为什么会把迷宫纹在身上呢?
Why would he put a maze on his skin?

26:47.510 --> 26:51.010
我不知道
I don't know.

27:10.570 --> 27:12.960
能找一下那个看守化学试剂的人吗?
How are your contacts in chemical lockup?

27:12.970 --> 27:14.430
看是谁了
Depends who's asking.

27:14.440 --> 27:18.190
我需要一瓶下水道除草剂  越快越好
I need a bottle of drain line root control,sooner than later.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.370
号子里长草了?
You got weeds growing in your cell?

27:21.380 --> 27:24.840
一瓶就够
Just one.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.430
你找我?
Looking for me?

27:29.440 --> 27:32.760
是的  我想就林肯·布伦斯 的案子问您几个问题
I wanted to ask some questions about the Lincoln Burrows case.

27:32.770 --> 27:33.560
是么?
Yeah?

27:33.570 --> 27:37.180
维罗妮卡·多诺万 林肯的辩护律师
I'm Veronica Donovan.I'm representing Lincoln on his appeal.

27:37.190 --> 27:38.440
想问些什么?
What about it?

27:38.450 --> 27:40.400
你是案发后
You were the first one

27:40.410 --> 27:42.360
第一个到林肯家的人  对么?
to Lincoln's apartment the night of the murder.Right?

27:42.370 --> 27:43.240
没错
Right.

27:43.250 --> 27:46.490
我非常感激你能确切的 告诉我你都看到了什么
I'd really appreciate it if you could just tell me exactly what you saw.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.970
有人举报称
Dispatch called.

27:47.970 --> 27:51.970
看到布伦斯从 特伦斯·斯蒂德曼遇害的那间车库跑出来
Burrows was seen running from the garage where they found Steadman.

27:51.980 --> 27:54.790
然后我们就去布伦斯家
So we went over to Burrows' place.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.870
接着开始搜查
We spread out,

27:55.880 --> 27:57.250
进入浴室
I took the bathroom.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.590
然后看到您的代理人在洗血衣
I saw your client washing out the bloody pants.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.180
警察 把手举起来
Police! Hands up.

28:01.190 --> 28:03.750
我不用再告诉您那是斯蒂德曼的血了吧?
I don't need to tell you it was Steadman's blood.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.700
按照当晚的报告
In the report you typed up,

28:05.710 --> 28:09.020
你只说看到林肯站在浴室里  仅此而已
you said you saw Lincoln in the bathroom. That's all.

28:09.030 --> 28:11.500
然后你又说看见他在洗血衣
Later,you testified that you saw him washing the pants.

28:11.510 --> 28:12.900
到底哪个是真的?
Which one is it?

28:12.910 --> 28:14.260
这重要么?
Does it matter?

28:14.270 --> 28:16.970
你到底看没看见他在洗血衣?
Did you see him washing the pants or not?

28:16.980 --> 28:18.050
是的
Yes.

28:18.060 --> 28:19.520
他站起来  转过身
He stood up,turned around,

28:19.530 --> 28:22.420
手还是湿的  一看就知道是他干的
his hands were all wet,looking guilty as hell.

28:22.430 --> 28:26.390
是你的证词给他定罪的  你知道么?
Your testimony factored into his conviction.You know that,right?

28:26.400 --> 28:29.810
夫人  如果你有任何疑问的话
You know,lady,if you got any other questions,

28:29.820 --> 28:33.670
直接去找相关部门吧
just go through the department.

28:44.870 --> 28:46.180
多诺万小姐
Ms Donovan?

28:46.190 --> 28:49.790
我无意吓到你
I didn't mean to scare you.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.260
你来这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

28:51.270 --> 28:53.580
司法公正局的 尼克·萨维恩
Nick Savrinn,with Project Justice.

28:53.590 --> 28:56.520
我知道你是谁 你来这里干什么?
I know who you are,but what are you doing here?

28:56.530 --> 28:59.700
我的上司可能认为林肯的案子不值一提
Look,my boss may not think Lincoln's case is worth looking into,

28:59.710 --> 29:03.480
但我不这么想
but I do.

29:18.030 --> 29:22.250
有个更快速的办法帮你解决烦恼
There's a quicker way to take care of your problem.

29:27.440 --> 29:30.900
还有最聪明的办法
There's smarter ways,too.

30:16.030 --> 30:18.370
大部分的有关死刑犯的案子
What stood out was that most death penalty cases

30:18.380 --> 30:20.850
往往有10年左右的上诉期
take ten years to exhaust all appeals.

30:20.860 --> 30:23.080
林肯却只有三年的时间
Lincoln got there in three.

30:23.090 --> 30:24.530
一切显得那么顺理成章
So for it to be expedited,

30:24.540 --> 30:27.250
定是出于某种政治的考虑  对么?
there had to have been some political influence,right?

30:27.260 --> 30:29.960
特伦斯·斯蒂德曼是副总统的哥哥对么?
Steadman was the vice-president's brother.

30:29.970 --> 30:31.400
这就不难相信了
It's not hard to believe.

30:31.410 --> 30:34.480
怎么可能? 他们搞定了所有的法官?
How? They got to every judge that rejected his appeal?

30:34.490 --> 30:37.420
根本用不着法官
It doesn't take ajudge.

30:37.690 --> 30:41.150
只要她的手下稍微做些手脚就行了
All it takes is a little special attention from one of his clerks.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.620
我对林肯被处死刑之快没有兴趣 我关心的是他们为什么要这么做
But how Lincoln got fast-tracked doesn't interest me. It's why.

30:44.630 --> 30:47.030
若他真是被陷害的 究竟又是为了什么呢?
If he was set up,then why?

30:47.040 --> 30:50.760
可能只有被害人才知道
I think the answer to that might lie in the victim.

30:50.770 --> 30:53.530
我们知道什么? 他是菲尔德公司的首席执行官对么?
What do we know? He was a CEO of EcoField,right?

30:53.540 --> 30:55.330
还是替代能源的倡导者
 He was pushing alternative energy.

30:55.340 --> 30:57.800
而且他做的很成功
Successfully pushing alternative energy.

30:57.810 --> 31:01.480
于是石油公司  沙特人  甚至是我们的政府...
Oil companies,the Saudis,even our government ...

31:01.490 --> 31:05.550
若斯蒂德曼消失的话 很多人都会从中受益
a lot of people stood to benefit with Steadman out of the picture.

31:06.300 --> 31:09.550
你为什么现在才受理这案子?
Why did you wait till now to take up this case?

31:09.560 --> 31:13.530
我也和别人一样  原以为是他干的
I thought he did it,like everybody else.

31:13.540 --> 31:15.760
希望还为时不晚
I just hope it's not too late.

31:15.770 --> 31:17.560
很可能已经晚了
It very well may be.

31:17.570 --> 31:20.770
你要有心理准备
You need to prepare yourself for that.

31:21.860 --> 31:24.220
那你呢?
What about you?

31:24.230 --> 31:28.020
为什么选择干这行?
Why death penalty work?

31:28.650 --> 31:32.070
我父亲含冤入狱15年
My father did 15 years for a crime he didn't commit.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.430
我深知一旦你被政府盯上了
I know that when the government gets you in their cross hairs,

31:34.440 --> 31:37.030
就很难再翻身了
you stand very little chance.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.260
这就是为什么
That's why.

31:42.150 --> 31:47.380
那么现在...需要我帮忙么?
Now,do you want my help?

32:09.030 --> 32:10.330
-我想加入  -太晚了
-I want in. -Too late.

32:10.340 --> 32:12.090
让我做什么都行  看见这双手了么?
I'll do anything.See this hand?

32:12.100 --> 32:13.270
简直就是挖掘机
These hands are digging machines.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.860
你想去中国? 我就挖到中国
And if you want to go to China ,I'll get you to China.

32:14.870 --> 32:17.210
我会像疯狂的穿山甲一样为你打地洞
I'll dig like a psychotic rodent if I have to.

32:17.220 --> 32:19.350
嫩鸡... 你一定要带上我
Fish,I gotta be back in.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.390
就目前来看  你没法回来
As of right now,there is no in.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.730
那边的凡高兄弟  是我的新狱友
Van Gogh over there is my new cell mate.

32:23.740 --> 32:25.010
你总会有办法的  对么?
But you're gonna do something about it ,right?

32:25.020 --> 32:27.380
-你会把他弄走的  -如果必要的话 我会的
-You're gonna get rid of him. -I'll do what's necessary.

32:27.390 --> 32:30.520
爱死你了
You're my boy.

32:31.980 --> 32:33.520
那你打算怎么办?
So how you gonna do it?

32:33.530 --> 32:35.590
只好这样了
Let's just put it this way.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.660
有人得受些皮肉之苦了
Someone's gonna get hurt.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.820
我们怎么没注意到这个?
How did we miss this guy?

32:47.830 --> 32:51.010
斯科菲尔德的父亲 在他出生时就已经不在了
Scofield's father was out of the picture by the time he was born.

32:51.020 --> 32:52.560
于是就跟了母亲的姓
Took his mother's name.

32:52.570 --> 32:56.870
斯科菲尔德没有前科 而且还是个全职的工程师
All right. Scofield had no priors and a full-time job as an engineer?

32:56.880 --> 32:57.640
没错
Correct.

32:57.650 --> 33:01.950
有一天他突然去抢银行  然后弃械投降
Then he goes and robs a bank,discharging a gun in the process,

33:01.960 --> 33:05.170
宣判的时候  他海申请被关在狐狸河监狱
so in sentencing he could manoeuvre his way to Fox River,

33:05.180 --> 33:08.580
同时他哥哥在那里的日子却不到一个月了
where his brother's scheduled to die in less than a month.

33:08.590 --> 33:10.310
显然他是有预谋的
Obviously,something's up.

33:10.320 --> 33:14.600
不过兄弟同在一所 监狱服刑倒也不稀奇
With all due respect,brothers are incarcerated together all over in the country.

33:14.610 --> 33:16.500
或许只是巧合
It may just be a coincidence.

33:16.510 --> 33:18.430
把弟弟弄走
Move on the younger brother.

33:18.440 --> 33:24.790
做干净点 以免坏了咱们的大事
Do it pre-emptively,before anything rises up,bites any of us in the ass.

33:36.990 --> 33:39.570
是路径图...
It's a pathway.

33:39.580 --> 33:42.100
它到底通向哪儿?
Where does it lead?

33:43.430 --> 33:46.160
你要把我带哪儿去?
Where are you taking me?

33:51.600 --> 33:54.360
你疯了么?
What? Are you nuts?

33:54.670 --> 33:55.920
长官
Officer!

33:55.930 --> 33:58.990
我要见长官
I need an officer!

33:59.000 --> 34:01.170
出什么事了?
What the hell's the problem down here?

34:01.180 --> 34:03.030
噢...这个婊子养的
What the... Son of a bitch.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.380
打开40号
Open up on 40.

34:05.390 --> 34:08.430
他身上有张路径图  通向某处
He's got the pathway on his body.It leads somewhere.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.760
退后  海威尔
Back off,Haywire

34:09.770 --> 34:12.710
不  看他的纹身  是张路径图
No,look.Look at his tattoos. It's a pathway.

34:12.720 --> 34:15.180
海威尔  我说了"退后" 你要来点胡椒水么?
Haywire.I said back off.You want a hot shot?

34:15.190 --> 34:16.790
我都说了  你看他的...
I'm telling you, look... Argh!

34:16.800 --> 34:19.270
退后  伙计 快进来帮忙
Back off, man.

34:19.280 --> 34:19.950
把他带走
Let's go. Get him out of here.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.920
那是通向地狱(之路)
It leads to hell!

34:21.930 --> 34:23.650
通向地狱
It leads to hell!

34:23.660 --> 34:26.050
通向地狱之路
It's a pathway to hell!

34:26.060 --> 34:30.260
他要把我们带到地狱
He's taking us all to hell!

34:47.000 --> 34:52.790
老伙计又团聚了 真是不错啊
So, the gang's all back together again.Well, ain't that swell?

34:52.800 --> 34:55.390
告诉过你不要背着我去找监狱长
I told you not to go around me with the Pope.

34:55.400 --> 34:59.030
可你就是不听  是不是?
But you just keep making waves, don't you?

35:07.790 --> 35:11.200
回来真好  欢迎归来
Good to be back, man. Good to have you back.

35:14.710 --> 35:19.080
咱们什么时候开始?
So, when do we get started?

35:45.590 --> 35:47.480
下午好 斯科菲尔德先生
Good afternoon, Mr Scofield.

35:47.490 --> 35:49.640
你好
Hello.

35:49.650 --> 35:51.710
今天感觉如何?
How are you feeling today?

35:51.720 --> 35:54.070
很好
Real good.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.400
又怎么了?
What happened?

35:57.410 --> 36:02.290
打篮球时吃了一暗肘
Caught an elbow playing basketball.

36:05.210 --> 36:06.790
我能看一下么?
Mind if I take a look?

36:06.800 --> 36:09.370
当然
By all means.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.300
你会把命丢了的  知道么?
You know you're gonna get killed in here, right?

36:19.310 --> 36:22.370
要是再不小心点的话
If you're not careful.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.240
我答应你
I'll make you a bet.

36:25.250 --> 36:28.980
要能活着出去
When I get out of here, alive,

36:28.990 --> 36:31.820
就请你共进晚餐
I'll take you to dinner.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.100
午餐或者咖啡什么的
Lunch. Cup of coffee.

36:35.110 --> 36:39.080
迈克尔  这种表达魅力的方式
Michael, this charm act

36:39.090 --> 36:43.740
正是你惹祸上身的原因
could be exactly what's getting you into trouble out in the yard.

36:47.770 --> 36:50.340
往前点
Lean forward.

37:00.880 --> 37:01.720
好的...
All right.

37:01.730 --> 37:02.950
你来到停车场
You went to the parking garage,

37:02.960 --> 37:05.460
特伦斯·斯蒂德曼就已经死了
Terence Steadman is already dead.

37:05.470 --> 37:06.550
没错
That's right.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.070
你发现后就跑掉了... 带着枪
You saw that, you ran? Took the gun?

37:09.080 --> 37:10.760
把枪扔了  扔哪儿了?
 Dumped the gun. Where?

37:10.770 --> 37:12.880
下水道  位于范布伦和威尔士
Storm drain. Van Buren and Wells.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.910
至今未被发现
Nobody ever found it.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.760
好的  那之后你做了什么?
What did you do after that?

37:16.770 --> 37:18.280
回到家?
Go back to your apartment?

37:18.290 --> 37:20.670
是的
Yeah.

37:22.360 --> 37:25.980
我吓坏了  想弄明白是怎么回事
I was freaking out,trying to figure out what had happened.

37:25.990 --> 37:30.070
然后发现浴缸里有条血迹斑斑的裤子
Then I saw the bloody pants in the tub.

37:32.310 --> 37:35.210
一分钟之后警察就赶到了
The cops, they busted in a minute after I got there.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.900
裤子上有斯蒂德曼的血迹
The pants, with Steadman's blood on them.

37:37.910 --> 37:41.380
第一个到现场的警察说亲眼 看到你在浴缸里洗那条裤子
First cop on the scene says he saw you washing them in the tub.

37:41.390 --> 37:42.150
他在说谎
He's lying.

37:42.160 --> 37:45.360
我手湿是因为洗脸弄的
My hands were wet after splashing water on my face.

37:45.370 --> 37:48.690
警察 把手举起来 把手举起来
Police! Let's see the hands! Hands up!

37:48.700 --> 37:51.320
我从未碰过那条裤子
I never touched those pants.

37:51.330 --> 37:53.080
再说说枪的事
Which brings us back to the gun,

37:53.090 --> 37:54.360
被你扔掉的那把枪
the one you dumped.

37:54.370 --> 37:55.110
这是设计好了的
It was planted.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.020
只能这么解释
Only way it could have got there.

37:57.030 --> 37:58.630
弹道完全吻合
Ballistics matched it to a slug...

37:58.640 --> 38:01.020
枪是嫁祸的 他们设计好了的
The gun was planted.

38:01.030 --> 38:02.560
就像血裤一样
Just like the pants.

38:02.570 --> 38:06.340
枪上有你的指纹
Your fingerprints were all over the gun.

38:08.730 --> 38:11.050
博...
Bo.

38:14.430 --> 38:15.530
博是谁?
Who's Bo?

38:15.540 --> 38:19.120
这一切都是他安排的
He's the guy who arranged everything.

38:20.030 --> 38:21.860
他让我前一天的晚上去找他
He had me come round the night before,

38:21.870 --> 38:24.370
试了几把枪  看哪把最适合
try a few guns, see which one felt right.

38:24.380 --> 38:25.980
那时就设计好了
That was the setup.

38:25.990 --> 38:27.860
凶器肯定就在那些枪之中
One of those must have been the murder weapon.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.310
枪上也就有了我的指纹
That's how they got my fingerprints on the gun.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.780
一定是这样
Had to be.

38:32.790 --> 38:34.780
那么这个叫 博的人...
All right. So this Bo,

38:34.790 --> 38:40.280
他逼你做这个  来偿还那9万元的欠款
he coerces you into doing this, all to clear a $90,000 debt?

38:40.500 --> 38:43.380
还扬言要杀了我儿子
He was gonna kill my son.

38:43.390 --> 38:44.240
进展如何?
Well?

38:44.250 --> 38:46.950
一大堆"不是我干的" 这些又起不了作用
Lot of "I didn't do it", don't count for much.

38:46.960 --> 38:49.380
监控录像  记录林肯扣动扳机的那盘...
The tape that shows Lincoln pulling the trigger.

38:49.390 --> 38:50.940
还在你手里么?  是的
 You got it?  Yeah.

38:50.950 --> 38:53.350
如果林肯说的属实  那盘录像就是伪造的
If Lincoln's telling the truth, the tape's lying

38:53.360 --> 38:57.480
咱们应该好好看看 看能不能发现什么
I think we should have a look,decide for ourselves.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.770
没人
You're clear.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.890
既然化学试剂能够腐蚀钢管
If the chemicals can eat through the iron pipes,

39:24.900 --> 39:27.520
为什么牙膏筒却没事?
how come they can't eat through the tube?

39:27.530 --> 39:31.100
只有当两种试剂混合才会发生发应
When the chemicals are combined,they become a corrosive.

39:31.110 --> 39:33.190
你是学化学的?
You studied chemistry or something?

39:33.200 --> 39:35.840
不是在学校学的
Not in school.

39:50.730 --> 39:53.560
你在医务室做什么了
But what you're doing up there in the infirmary,

39:53.570 --> 39:55.840
又和这里的事情有什么联系呢?
what's it gotta do with this here?

39:55.850 --> 39:58.930
打通这堵墙只是个开始
Getting through this wall is just the beginning.

39:58.940 --> 40:03.270
这里和外墙之间还有很多房间
There's a whole lot of real estate in between here and the outside walls.

40:03.280 --> 40:08.190
医务室是最靠近外墙的建筑
The infirmary's the closest building to those walls.

40:12.010 --> 40:15.100
...也是安全措施中最薄弱的环节
And the weakest link in the security chain.

40:15.110 --> 40:17.650
酷
Cool.

40:22.950 --> 40:26.430
我想挖的已经差不多了
I think I've removed enough grout to bust through.

40:26.440 --> 40:29.870
现在帮我弄点噪声
I'm gonna need you to make some noise.

40:38.430 --> 40:42.780
就这么点本事么?
Is that the best you can do?

40:42.850 --> 40:44.650
要相信我  哥们
Have some faith,papi.

40:44.660 --> 40:47.200
要相信我
Have some faith.

40:49.370 --> 40:51.650
闭嘴
Shut up!

41:35.800 --> 41:38.140
都给我闭嘴
Not one more word.

41:38.150 --> 41:43.330
谁再出声就关禁闭
Next inmate that opens his mouth goes in the hole.

41:55.820 --> 41:58.540
没事了
We're good.

42:25.360 --> 42:27.480
你还好吧?
You OK?

42:29.950 --> 42:32.340
工作的事
Work.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.900
没什么
It's fine.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.640
我来
I got it.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.100
还算顺利吧?
Everything all right?

42:44.110 --> 42:46.170
非常的顺利
Couldn't be better.

42:46.180 --> 42:48.900
进来坐会么? 我们正要吃晚餐呢
You want to come in?We just sat down to eat.

42:48.910 --> 42:53.410
不  我只想私下和你聊聊
No. I just wanted to stop by to tell you in person.

42:54.630 --> 42:56.650
问题解决了
Problem solved.

42:56.660 --> 42:58.090
这是什么?
What's this?

42:58.100 --> 43:00.340
移送申请
That is a transfer request.

43:00.350 --> 43:05.470
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德 明天就会被转走了
Michael Scofield is getting shipped out tomorrow.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.690
晚安
Have a good night.
