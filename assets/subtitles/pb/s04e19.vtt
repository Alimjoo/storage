00:40.130 --> 00:42.560

00:47.560 --> 00:49.900

01:35.360 --> 01:36.400
你什么意思

01:36.400 --> 01:39.190
他不是一个无关的人  林肯

他和克里斯蒂娜一直互通邮件

01:42.460 --> 01:43.760
电话  等等等等

01:49.260 --> 01:52.500

01:53.100 --> 01:56.330
离开这里  迈克

01:56.330 --> 01:57.730
林肯

02:01.800 --> 02:03.930
"锡拉"在什么地方
Where's Scylla?

02:03.930 --> 02:05.000
我不知道

02:05.000 --> 02:06.560
"锡拉"在什么地方
Where's Scylla?!

02:15.700 --> 02:17.800

02:48.300 --> 02:50.090
喂  克里斯蒂娜

02:51.900 --> 02:53.090
我希望 你对我说实话

02:53.090 --> 02:55.330

Let's start with Vincent Sandinsky.

02:56.290 --> 02:57.760
文森特·圣丁斯奇  那个科学家吗
Vincent Sandinsky the scientist?

02:57.760 --> 03:00.090
他是我的老朋友
He, uh, he's an old friend of mine.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.400
有点让人讨厌  你觉得呢
A bit of a bore, don't you think?

03:02.400 --> 03:04.500
但谁管他呢
But who cares about him?

03:04.500 --> 03:06.560
我更想谈谈你的问题
I'd rather talk about you.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.060
我想和你面对面谈
I'd rather meet you face-to-face.

03:09.060 --> 03:12.600
除非你把"锡拉"带来  否则免谈
Unless you're bringing me Scylla, I'm not interested.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.400
没有"锡拉"  就别想见面
No Scylla, no meeting.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.000
这是我唯一的条件
That's all I can offer.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.300
你的目标是什么

03:19.300 --> 03:21.260
十分钟内给我答案

03:26.260 --> 03:28.160
找到他了

03:28.160 --> 03:31.600
他在埃尔波特尔的工业区
He's in an industrial park in El Portal.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.700
就在海边
Right up the coast.

03:32.700 --> 03:33.830
很好
All right,

03:33.830 --> 03:36.230
我们行动
Let's go.

03:36.230 --> 03:39.330
你撒谎  你撒谎
You're lying, you're lying.

03:39.330 --> 03:40.430
我不是公司的人
I don't work for the company,

03:40.430 --> 03:42.660
你就是谎话连篇
Six words that never prove true.

03:42.660 --> 03:45.330
你玩完了  认命吧
Come on, man, this is over, look around!

03:45.330 --> 03:46.630
你还想耍什么把戏
What are you doing here?!  

03:46.630 --> 03:47.830
我发誓什么都不知道
I swear I don't know anything, I do.

03:47.830 --> 03:49.430
他说的我一点都不知道
I don't know what he's talking about.

I am here for a conference,

03:51.290 --> 03:53.080

03:53.080 --> 03:53.790
我知道了
I do,

03:54.040 --> 03:55.050
迈克也一句实话没说
And Michael's also full of crap.

03:55.050 --> 03:57.300
-他没理由撒谎  -事实上  他有
- He's got no reason to lie.  - Actually, he does.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.160
迈克给我们假情报  就能找机会插手
Michael's leading us off the scent, so he can get in...

03:59.160 --> 04:00.780
他和我们一样  
He doesn't want Christina to have Scylla

04:00.780 --> 04:01.790
不想让克里斯蒂娜得到"锡拉"
Any more than we do.

04:01.790 --> 04:04.090
他对我们撒谎  不是一两次了
It's not the first time he's lied to us.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.160
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.830

Vincent and I need to talk.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.600

这样你就明白来龙去脉了吧  布鲁斯
That brings you full circle, doesn't it,Burrows?

05:38.300 --> 05:40.000
但是  你早就知道了
But you knew that already.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.360
你准备什么时候告诉我

05:44.400 --> 05:46.630

他一个人就能解决

这就是迈克打电话的地方
This is where Michael's signal is coming from?

07:57.130 --> 07:58.760

10:12.840 --> 10:15.480
"锡拉"在哪里
Where is it?

10:15.480 --> 10:18.450
你知道我不会说的  对不对
You don't really expect me to answer that, do you?

10:18.550 --> 10:20.610
实际上  你会说

10:20.610 --> 10:23.080
不说你就死命一条
Because your life depends on it,

10:23.080 --> 10:24.480
根据你的记录

10:24.480 --> 10:25.780
我可以很保守地估计
I think it's safe to assume

10:25.780 --> 10:29.010
你总是为自己着想
That you're always looking out for number one.

10:29.010 --> 10:33.240
迈克  这一天我等了25年了
I've waited 25 years for this moment, Michael.

10:33.250 --> 10:36.980
我不可能把我知道的全告诉你
There's no way I can say everything I want to say.

10:36.980 --> 10:37.950
我为什么要让你说
Why should I let you?

10:37.950 --> 10:40.010
因为我是你的母亲
Because I'm your mother.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.750
有些事情是改变不了的
That's something you can't change.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.750

10:54.750 --> 10:57.850
至于其他  我就不敢那么说了
In other ways, i'm not so sure.

林肯让你走了一条艰难的路
Lincoln has led you down a dark path.

11:01.050 --> 11:02.680
我自己决定的
I make my own decisions.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.410
你帮林肯逃出监狱
You break Lincoln out of prison

11:04.410 --> 11:07.210
他却帮克兰兹将军做事
And he goes to work for general Krantz.

11:07.210 --> 11:10.010
他有他自己的理由
And he has his reasons.

11:10.010 --> 11:12.950
如果你想找我们之间的共同点
But if you're looking for some kind of common ground

11:12.950 --> 11:14.850
我觉得就那么多了
Between us, maybe that's it.

11:14.850 --> 11:17.880
我也不想让林肯给公司卖命
I don't want to see Lincoln working for the company, either.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.440
最少你不再给他找借口了
At least you've stopped making excuses for him.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.710
我只是不再用主观考虑问题
I stopped making judgments.

11:22.710 --> 11:24.580
我已经不能那么做了
Something I couldn't afford.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.480
这些都是以前的问题了
But that was a long time ago,

11:26.480 --> 11:28.710
这不是我们谈话的主题
And that's not why we're here.

11:28.710 --> 11:30.410
我知道
No.

11:30.410 --> 11:32.880
你是对的
You're right.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.640
我们都不想公司得到"锡拉"
None of us wants to see Scylla go back to the company.

11:36.650 --> 11:38.850
如果我们能摒弃前嫌
So, if we can put the past behind us,

11:38.850 --> 11:41.410
我们还是可以做到的
Maybe we can work something out.

11:42.010 --> 11:43.850
举个例子
Like what?

11:43.850 --> 11:45.010
做个交易
Like a deal.

11:45.010 --> 11:47.450
交易
"A deal"?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.140
好吧
All right,

11:50.150 --> 11:51.610
你告诉我"锡拉"在哪
You tell me where Scylla is,

11:51.610 --> 11:53.780
我们再讨论细节
And we'll work out the details later.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.410
我们五五分
We'll go 50-50.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.740
母子行动
A mother-son operation?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.010
可能
Maybe.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.810
首先  "锡拉"
But first, Scylla.

12:01.810 --> 12:05.550
算了吧  迈克  我更了解
Please, Michael, I know better.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.280
我们是一类人
We're very similar.

12:11.350 --> 12:13.850
我知道  当我们看着一个事物
I know what it's like to look at the big picture,

12:13.850 --> 12:16.480
想到的却是所有小的零件
See all the little moving parts...

12:16.480 --> 12:20.450
手术之后大脑更灵活了
How much easier it is to think after the surgery.

12:20.750 --> 12:23.150
我了解你
I know you.

12:23.150 --> 12:25.610
这就是为什么你不可能
That's why you'll never be able to manipulate me

12:25.610 --> 12:28.380
像操纵其他人一样操纵我
Like you do the rest of the world.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.780
你没时间了
You're running out of time.

12:54.210 --> 12:56.210
里面没人
All right, there's no one back here!

12:56.210 --> 12:57.680
他们刚刚还在 
Well, they were here, but of course,

12:57.680 --> 12:58.740
但是现在肯定没人
There's nobody here now.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.080
总是这样
'Cause that's what happens.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.940
你们说呢
You know, this

13:01.950 --> 13:04.480
所有的事情
Whole thing...

13:04.480 --> 13:06.610
全部都是
It's just...

13:06.610 --> 13:09.050
全部都是垃圾
It's just... crap!

13:09.950 --> 13:11.580
我们总是比别人慢一步
We're always one move behind,

13:11.580 --> 13:12.980
每次都是这样
Every step of the way.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.180
而且巴格韦尔现在小人得志
Yeah, and it's just going to get worse now that 

13:15.180 --> 13:16.780
更让我们觉得难受
Bagwell is breathing down our backs.

13:16.780 --> 13:18.710
你怎么能犯那种错误
How do you make that kind of mistake, huh?!

13:18.710 --> 13:21.810
让那个垃圾和我们在一起
And let that inbred get anywhere near us.

13:21.810 --> 13:24.110
不  我们就不该为克兰兹做事
No, no, no, the first mistake was working for Krantz.

13:24.110 --> 13:25.090
对  那是第一个错误  
Okay, that was the first mistake. 

13:25.090 --> 13:25.910
那你觉得以后会怎么样
what do you think's going to happen now 

13:25.910 --> 13:27.910
他和他的狐朋狗友作威作福
that he's in town and he has his goons

13:27.910 --> 13:30.150
我们现在怎么办
Calling the shots? what's going to happen now?

13:30.150 --> 13:31.980
我在这些事情发生前
Yeah, I should've known better

13:31.980 --> 13:34.080
就应该想到的
Than to get anywhere near this.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.110
好了  我们该走了
All right, you know what? we should go.

13:36.110 --> 13:37.350
-我们走吧  -我们不能走
- Let's go.  - No, we can't go,

13:37.360 --> 13:39.010
你看过那些照片了
Because you saw the photos,right?

13:39.010 --> 13:40.110
所以你应该知道
You saw the photos, so you know

13:40.110 --> 13:41.280
他会对他们做什么
what he's going to do with them.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.740
我们早该知道他会对他们做什么了
We should have known what he was going to do with them!

13:43.750 --> 13:45.870
我们应该早就知道  
That's what we should've... 

13:45.870 --> 13:46.580
冷静下来
Hey, hey, hey! just calm down.

13:46.580 --> 13:48.180
说实话吧  交易吹了
You know what, the deal is over.

13:48.180 --> 13:49.510
你知我知
Okay? you know it, i know it.

13:49.510 --> 13:51.580
所有人都知道  我们永远也逃不掉了
Everybody knows it. we're not getting out of here!

13:51.580 --> 13:53.610
要不我们自己走向绞刑架
We're going to take a walk right to the gallows,

13:53.610 --> 13:56.480
要不就是其他人把我们干掉
Or somebody else is going to stab us in the back!

13:56.480 --> 13:58.010
我以前也遇到过  但我活下来了
I did that walk and I survived.

13:58.010 --> 14:00.680
就算我们赢了
Even if we win,

14:00.680 --> 14:01.780
我们就真的赢了吗
Do we win?

14:01.780 --> 14:03.010
你也不信的  对吧
You don't believe that, do you?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.580
我会去做该做的
Look, i'm going to do what i got to do.

14:04.580 --> 14:07.080
你要不想和我一起  随你
If you don't want to roll with me, that's fine.

14:11.610 --> 14:12.980
这是什么
What is that?

14:12.980 --> 14:15.280
租借收据  银色小货车
Rental receipt, a silver minivan.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.080
这是什么
What is this?

14:29.850 --> 14:31.280
你对这个了解多少
What do you know about this?

14:31.280 --> 14:32.740
我们在小古巴
We found a whole

14:32.750 --> 14:34.380
发现了一箱子这个
Box of them down in Little Cuba.

14:34.380 --> 14:35.410
还有很多枪
Guns, too.

14:35.410 --> 14:38.710
你对这个了解多少
What do you know about this?

14:41.250 --> 14:43.410
她想让我在那儿演讲
She wanted me to speak there.

14:43.410 --> 14:45.110
是关于锡拉吗
About Scylla?

14:45.110 --> 14:46.540
她说会提前给我讲稿  
She said she'd give me the script beforehand, 

14:46.540 --> 14:47.880
我只知道这个
that's all I know.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.840
她说只是纯粹对科学感兴趣
She said her interest was purely scientific.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.280
她的兴趣是财富
Her interest was financial.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.680
一年前她找到我  说了自己的想法
She came to me about a year ago with an idea.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.740
她并不想利用锡拉作为永久的基石
Rather than build our organization

14:58.750 --> 15:00.550
来巩固我们的组织
With Scylla as the permanent cornerstone,

15:00.550 --> 15:02.710
而是想利用这项发明
She wanted to use the technology

15:02.710 --> 15:04.780
赚取短期利润
To make a quick profit.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.680
如果发生了什么
If certain events occurred,

15:06.680 --> 15:08.640
很多国家会觉得
Various nations might feel the need

15:08.650 --> 15:11.250
这种现代防御系统很有必要
For a more modern defense system,

15:11.250 --> 15:13.610
他们就会问我们要
And they'd come to us for the answers.

15:13.610 --> 15:15.210
太阳能武器
Solar weaponry.

15:15.210 --> 15:17.210
水去盐技术
Water desalination.

15:17.210 --> 15:18.740
现在告诉我们吧
Now, what do you know about all this?

15:18.750 --> 15:21.550
知道的我都说了
I told you all I know.

15:23.050 --> 15:26.080
这主意太疯狂了
Well, I thought it was a crazy idea.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.710
外行人的计划
Plan of an amateur.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.580
但我猜她会火冒三丈
But I figured she'd be angry.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.050
她没资格持有卡
She wasn't allowed to hold a card.

15:33.510 --> 15:35.680
你想说什么
Now, what was that?

15:36.880 --> 15:39.180
远不止这些
I think it's more than that.

15:39.180 --> 15:41.380
是嘛
Really?

15:41.380 --> 15:43.650
她告诉你什么了
What did she tell you?

15:44.750 --> 15:46.910
我知道公司运作的方式
I know how the company operates.

15:46.910 --> 15:49.610
像艾克菲尔德那样的假公司
Shell corporations like Ecofield,

15:49.610 --> 15:52.150
大量的经费滥用
Rampant misuse of funds.

15:53.050 --> 15:56.350
你的确是坐在金矿上
You're literally sitting on a gold mine.

15:56.350 --> 15:57.610
但你的领导
But your leadership

15:57.610 --> 15:59.280
只利于你和你朋友
Only benefits you and your friends

15:59.280 --> 16:01.080
及今后十代的发展
Ten generations in the future.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.840
而你
And you

16:03.850 --> 16:07.410
希望看到公司从内部瓦解
Would like to see the company implode?

16:08.280 --> 16:11.580
我希望看到改观
I want to see something happen.

16:11.580 --> 16:14.880
你简直是鼠目寸光
You think too small.

16:16.510 --> 16:17.610
老挝
Laos?

16:17.610 --> 16:20.940
得利前  我们都会没命
We'll all be dead before that pays off.

16:20.950 --> 16:23.880
老挝指什么
Uh, "Laos," sir?

16:23.880 --> 16:25.810
你不必多问
Don't trouble yourself.

16:28.610 --> 16:30.210
布鲁斯
Burrows?

16:30.210 --> 16:31.840
我有个问题问你的朋友
I got a question for your friend.

16:31.850 --> 16:33.110
什么问题
What is it?

16:33.110 --> 16:35.980
问他DMB是什么意思
Ask him what the letters "DMB" mean.

16:36.650 --> 16:41.480
DMB对你  有什么特殊含义吗
Do the letters "DMB" mean anything to you?

16:45.380 --> 16:47.110
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

16:47.980 --> 16:49.780
我以为你有点眼色的
I thought you understood me.

16:53.350 --> 16:56.740
她说东西放在
She said her place was

16:56.750 --> 16:59.910
戴德迈阿密银行那儿
On the same block as Dade-Miami bank.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.640
听到了吗
Did you hear that?

17:03.650 --> 17:04.680
知道了
I got it.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.710
他最好说的是实话
He'd better be telling the truth.

17:08.180 --> 17:09.610
看教授还知道什么
See what else the doctor knows.

17:09.610 --> 17:12.480
-不要啊  -克里斯蒂娜的计划是什么
- No... - What's Christina's plan?!

17:17.680 --> 17:19.010
我不知道
I don't know.

17:19.010 --> 17:20.410
不知道
I don't know.

17:20.410 --> 17:22.080
也许我们应该
Maybe we should've...

17:22.080 --> 17:24.410
也许我们应该跟踪她什么的
Maybe we should've followed her or something.

17:26.050 --> 17:28.240
坐下
Sit down for me.please.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.450
我和她谈谈如何
How about I talk to her?

17:35.110 --> 17:36.840
也许我有不同的理解
I might have some perspective.

17:36.850 --> 17:39.680
毕竟我妈妈没有在我6岁时丢下我
She didn't leave me when I was six.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.080
好的
Okay.

17:52.580 --> 17:54.780
莎拉  很遗憾我们以这种方式见面
I'm sorry we had to meet this way, Sara.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.010
我很遗憾我们竟然会见面
I'm sorry we had to meet at all.

17:57.010 --> 17:57.880
迈克在去年经受了
Michael's been through a lot in

17:57.880 --> 17:58.810
太多痛苦
the last year at some point.

17:58.810 --> 18:00.380
他已经不堪重负
It's going to be too much for him.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.980
迈克可以处理好的
Michael can handle it.

18:01.980 --> 18:04.680
他习惯于充满变化的生活
He's never known a life without change.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.150
你说得好像很了解他一样
Oh, you say that like you know him.

18:06.150 --> 18:07.680
没错
Oh, I do.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.080
比你了解多了
Better than you.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.250
这不太可能吧
I don't see how that's possible.

18:11.250 --> 18:14.650
你生下孩子时就知道了
Well, you will when your child's born.

18:17.050 --> 18:19.330
起初我并不确定  
See, I wasn't sure at first, 

18:19.600 --> 18:21.380
但你脸色不好
But you do have that drawn look.

18:21.380 --> 18:22.740
而且我看到你面对危险时
And I see the way you protect yourself

18:22.750 --> 18:24.810
保护自己的方式
when you sense danger.

18:24.810 --> 18:29.680
你自己察觉不到  这是本能
You don't even know you're doing it. It's instinct.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.740
你对母性本能了解多少
And what is it you know about maternal instinct?

18:31.750 --> 18:35.250
我尝试当个好母亲
I've tried to be a mother.

18:35.250 --> 18:36.980
甚至是对于林肯
Even to Lincoln.

18:36.980 --> 18:38.910
你怎么好意思说
How can you say that?

18:38.910 --> 18:43.710
你一句话不说就抛下他们
You left them without so much as an explanation.

18:43.710 --> 18:45.040
但如果迈克听...
But if Michael would listen...

18:45.050 --> 18:47.040
知道吗  你可以停手了
You know what? you can stop.

18:47.050 --> 18:49.850
你没资格为自己的行为辩解
You can't justify what you did.

18:51.050 --> 18:53.940
迈克不知道你怀孕了
Michael doesn't know you're pregnant,

18:53.950 --> 18:56.710
对吧
Does he?

19:02.010 --> 19:04.010
怎么了
What happened?

19:05.210 --> 19:07.810
她什么都没说
Uh... I got nothing.

19:23.950 --> 19:26.180
你好  乔伊丝
Hello, Joyce.

是6468号
It's actually box 6468.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.040
有许可吗
Is he authorized to access it?

19:42.050 --> 19:43.440
这就是问题了  他没有
See, that's the problem. he's not.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.410
但我们可以填写单据
But we're willing to fill out all the paperwork...

19:45.410 --> 19:47.510
抱歉  只有获得许可的个人

Where's your boss?

19:51.750 --> 19:53.540
先生  有什么要帮忙的吗
Sir? sir, can I help you?

19:53.550 --> 19:55.810
我要拿到我妈妈的安全箱
Yeah.I need to get in my mom's safe deposit box.

19:55.810 --> 19:57.440
-你有法院命令吗  -没有
- Do you have a court order?  - No. no.

19:57.450 --> 19:58.840
DMB政策不允许任何人...  
DMB policy prevents anyone... 

19:58.840 --> 19:59.340
这就是政策
Here's the policy.

19:59.350 --> 20:01.080
我要开6468号箱子  就现在
Okay, I need to open box 6468. Right now. 

20:01.080 --> 20:03.250
我是当·赛尔夫  国土安全局的

他刚离开
He just left.

20:08.310 --> 20:10.750
是一个带着银色手提箱的男的
It was the guy with the silver suitcase.

20:17.010 --> 20:18.880
他在那里
There he is.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.010
看起来像是大使馆里的那个
Hey, that looks like the guy from the embassy.

20:45.380 --> 20:47.080
班纳吉先生  你好吗
Mr. Banerjee, how are you?

20:47.080 --> 20:49.010
我试着联系克里斯蒂娜·汉普顿
I'm trying to reach Christina Hampton.

20:49.010 --> 20:50.790
她现在正在开会
She's in a meeting right now.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.710
五点前无法联系上
I don't talk to her before five.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.750
交易就取消
The deal is off.

21:15.610 --> 21:17.040
听好
Okay.

21:17.050 --> 21:19.840
这是我的最后提议
This is my final offer.

21:19.850 --> 21:21.510
你带我找到"锡拉"
You're going to take me to Scylla,

21:21.510 --> 21:22.910
就可以走了
And then you can walk.

21:22.910 --> 21:24.910
没有质问
No questions.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.180
也没人去告诉将军
No one tells the General.

21:26.180 --> 21:27.910
你下半辈子可以安稳生活
You can live the rest of your life

21:27.910 --> 21:29.040
就像这一切没有发生过
Like this never happened,

21:29.050 --> 21:31.110
但是"锡拉"是我的
But Scylla is mine.

21:31.110 --> 21:33.910
林肯绝不会放手不管的
Lincoln would never let that happen.

21:33.910 --> 21:35.980
他没必要知道
He doesn't have to know.

21:35.980 --> 21:37.980
你们小时候就总是不合
Even as children, you couldn't agree.

21:37.980 --> 21:40.180
你们常常争吵
You fought about everything.

21:40.180 --> 21:43.910
你们俩太不一样了
The two of you couldn't be more different.

21:43.910 --> 21:46.910
但你知道的  是吧  迈克
But you know that, don't you, Michael?

21:46.910 --> 21:48.380
这不关林肯的事
This isn't about Lincoln.

21:48.380 --> 21:50.810
你的眼睛是蓝色的  而他是绿色的
You have blue eyes, he has green.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.580
他去玩卡车
He played with trucks.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.540
而你把电视机给拆了
You took apart the television set.

21:55.550 --> 21:57.540
我没必要指出
And I don't need to point out

21:57.550 --> 21:59.080
你们的智商
The difference in IQ

21:59.080 --> 22:01.950
或者是性情的区别
Or temperament.

22:02.910 --> 22:04.250
你知道我在说什么
You know what I'm getting at,

22:04.250 --> 22:06.450
是吧  迈克
Don't you, Michael?

22:07.180 --> 22:09.340
我不知道
I don't have any idea

22:09.350 --> 22:11.640
你在说什么
What you're talking about.

22:11.650 --> 22:14.810
心底里你其实一直都知道
You've always known it deep in your heart.

22:14.810 --> 22:18.810
只是没人能来证实
You just had no one to confirm it.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.910
林肯
Lincoln...

22:25.550 --> 22:28.250
不是你的亲生哥哥
...Isn't your brother.

22:39.950 --> 22:42.710
这是真的
It's true.

22:42.710 --> 22:44.840
我应该早点告诉你
I should have told you before,

22:44.850 --> 22:48.980
但你一直很敬仰他
But you always looked up to him, and

22:48.980 --> 22:51.810
我没想到事情会发展到这个地步
I had no idea things would happen like this.

22:51.810 --> 22:53.880
你不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you're saying.

22:54.850 --> 22:56.380
你有见过
Have you ever

22:56.380 --> 22:59.780
林肯婴儿时候的相片吗
Seen pictures of Lincoln as a baby?

22:59.780 --> 23:02.180
-当然  -没有
- Yes. - No.

23:02.180 --> 23:04.810
根本就没有
There aren't any.

23:06.310 --> 23:10.870
他3岁时你父亲收养了他
Your father didn't adopt him until he was three years old.

23:11.980 --> 23:15.250
他父母为公司效力
His parents worked for the company.

23:15.250 --> 23:19.180
他们在马尼拉的一次爆炸中丧生
They were killed in an explosion in Manila.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.010
奥尔多第二天把他带回家
Aldo brought him home the next day.

23:22.010 --> 23:24.080
他觉得那是他的责任
He felt it was his duty.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.550
却无视我的感受
He didn't ask me how I felt.

23:28.780 --> 23:30.980
我和他之间从未有过
I...I never bonded with him

23:30.980 --> 23:33.540
母子之间的感情
Like mother and son.

23:33.550 --> 23:38.080
所以他总是很气愤
He was always so angry.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.810
就算可以理解
Understandably so...

23:39.810 --> 23:44.340
但他还是太小  记不清他的亲生母亲
He was too young to remember his mother, but

23:44.350 --> 23:48.580
可他一直都知道少了什么东西
He always knew something was missing.

23:48.580 --> 23:52.610
可恶  你竟然用这一招
I can't believe you're playing this card.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.280
对不起  迈克
I'm sorry, Michael.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.710
但我对你的感觉是不同的
But I felt differently about you.

24:00.710 --> 24:04.280
你能体会到
And you could tell.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.980
所以你才一直有内疚感
That's why you always felt guilty.

24:05.980 --> 24:09.210
所以你总在林肯必死无疑时  
Why you were always throwing yourself over the cliff

24:09.210 --> 24:11.110
奋不顾身  前来救他
After Lincoln was already dead at the bottom.

24:11.110 --> 24:13.980
所以你才进了监狱  毁了原来的生活
It's why you went to prison and pissed your life away.

24:13.980 --> 24:16.410
你不会明白为什么
You don't know why I did

24:16.410 --> 24:17.580
我会做这些
The things I did!

24:17.580 --> 24:20.210
你根本就不在我身边
You weren't there!

24:21.710 --> 24:24.880
天知道你本该有多大的成就
Who knows what you could have accomplished.

24:26.210 --> 24:29.180
可你一直觉得必须收敛自己的锋芒
But you always felt like you had to make less of yourself

24:29.180 --> 24:34.150
才不至于让林肯太可悲
To make Lincoln look less pathetic in comparison.

24:34.150 --> 24:37.830
林肯胜过亲兄
Lincoln was more of a brother to me 

24:37.830 --> 24:40.940
而你枉为人母
than you were ever a mother.

24:40.950 --> 24:43.080
你抛弃了我
You left.

24:43.080 --> 24:46.150
他陪伴着我
He stayed.

24:46.150 --> 24:49.710
他供养我
He fed me.

24:49.710 --> 24:51.740
让我不至于颠沛流离
Kept me off the streets.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.310
供我读书
Put me through school.

24:53.310 --> 24:54.980
怎么做到的
How?

24:54.980 --> 24:57.510
让你不停的陷入麻烦吗
By getting in trouble over and over again,

24:57.510 --> 25:00.310
就像他现在那样
Just like he is right now.

25:00.310 --> 25:01.940
现在是什么意思
What do you mean, right now?

25:01.950 --> 25:03.280
他在哪
Where is he?

25:03.280 --> 25:04.610
他在路上
He's out

25:04.610 --> 25:07.940
去找"锡拉"  但他是不会找到的
Looking for Scylla, and he's not going to find it.

25:07.950 --> 25:11.150
也许你该打电话告诉他
Maybe you should call him and tell him.

25:11.150 --> 25:13.980
除非你们之间
Unless there's too much

25:13.980 --> 25:16.350
感情很差
Bad blood between you.

25:16.980 --> 25:19.150
或根本毫无感情
Or no blood.

25:46.850 --> 25:48.710
谁打过来的
Who's the guy in the ring?

25:48.710 --> 25:51.540
是迈克吗
Is it Michael?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.880
他会没事的  别紧张
He's gonna be all right. Just relax.

25:57.750 --> 26:00.180
他在哪
Where is he?

26:02.050 --> 26:05.410
快跟上他  快
All right, keep up with him, come on.

26:05.410 --> 26:07.150
我正在做  少罗嗦
I am. Just shut up.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.680
不是我不想帮你
It's not that I don't want to help you.

26:15.680 --> 26:19.920
只是我不愿再看见你为了他牺牲自己
It's just that I hate to see you go running after him again.

26:21.050 --> 26:22.510
迈克  别这样
Michael. Come here!

26:23.780 --> 26:27.250
-迈克  -他在哪
- Michael! - Where is he?

26:28.550 --> 26:31.750
好吧  你想为了他
Okay. You want to go running after him,

26:31.750 --> 26:35.050
把自己的生活一次性毁掉  就动手吧
Flush your life down the toilet once and for all? Go ahead!

26:35.050 --> 26:36.680
我发誓
I swear!

26:36.680 --> 26:39.210
如果你不告诉我他在哪  
If don't you tell me where he is, 

26:39.220 --> 26:40.810
我发誓就亲手杀了你  
Or I'll kill you,myself, I swear to God!

26:40.820 --> 26:41.950
我会亲手杀了你
I'll kill you myself.

26:41.950 --> 26:43.220
迈克
Michael!

26:43.820 --> 26:45.080
迈克
Michael!

26:45.080 --> 26:48.080
迈克
Michael!

26:48.080 --> 26:51.380
快告诉我
Come on! Tell me!

26:52.750 --> 26:54.010
他在哪  他在哪
Where is he? where is he?

26:54.020 --> 26:56.020
林肯在哪
Where is Lincoln?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.010
林肯在哪
Where is Lincoln?

27:02.010 --> 27:03.950
好吧
All right. Fine.

27:04.980 --> 27:06.250
大概一小时内在熊猫海岸酒店
There's an energy conference

27:06.250 --> 27:08.810
有个能源会议
At the Panda Bay Hotel in about an hour.

27:08.820 --> 27:10.810
他会去那儿的
He'll be there.

27:10.820 --> 27:13.450
我说的是真话
That's the truth.

27:47.010 --> 27:48.880
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

27:49.980 --> 27:51.350
我不知道该怎么去想
I don't know what to think.

27:51.350 --> 27:52.910
快走  快快快
Go. Go, go go.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.510
去找到他
Go find him.

27:55.450 --> 27:56.950
我来看着她  去吧
I got her. Go.

27:56.950 --> 28:00.180
如果她惹什么麻烦的话
If she gives you any trouble...

28:00.180 --> 28:01.780
如果她惹什么麻烦的话
If she gives you any trouble...

28:01.780 --> 28:03.750
我知道  
I know.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.220
去吧
Just...go.

28:32.350 --> 28:36.950
你超额完成了任务  巴格韦尔
You have surpassed expectations, Bagwell.

28:36.950 --> 28:39.910
你不只会收集情报
You're much more than an informant.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.380
我是多面手
I multitask.

28:42.380 --> 28:45.250
很好  如果事情进展顺利
Hmm. Well, if things go as well as expected here,

28:45.250 --> 28:47.280
你会按照约定得到奖赏
You'll be rewarded accordingly.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.650
做公司的特别联络员吗
As a special liaison to the company?

28:50.650 --> 28:52.250
没错
Yes.

28:52.250 --> 28:54.910
要承担什么任务呢
What exactly does that entail?

28:54.920 --> 28:56.910
那要你自己决定了
Well, that would be up to you.

28:56.920 --> 29:01.310
通常公司的探员会选择自己的生涯规划
Most company operatives choose their own career path,

29:01.310 --> 29:03.450
但是我不知道有什么适合你的
Though I can't say what would suit you.

29:03.450 --> 29:07.510
来自阿拉巴马的强奸犯都会做什么啊
What do sexual predators from Alabama typically do,

29:07.520 --> 29:09.310
除了表像上的
Uh, aside from the obvious?

29:09.310 --> 29:12.750
那都是以前的事了  将军
Those days are behind me, general.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.080
在教育上的缺陷
What I lack in formal education,

29:15.080 --> 29:17.110
我能以天生的才能和好奇心
I more than make up for in

29:17.110 --> 29:20.480
加倍弥补
Natural skills and curiosity.

29:20.480 --> 29:23.810
还有  我的忠心永无止境
And as you've seen, my loyalty knows no bounds.

29:23.820 --> 29:25.850
那你肯定会轻松
Then you shouldn't have any difficulty

29:25.850 --> 29:27.310
通过最后考核
Passing your final exam.

29:27.310 --> 29:32.280
你肯定不希望 有人暗算你  
Now, you didn't expect that  a few phone calls on the sly

29:32.280 --> 29:34.850
让你一辈子遭受牢狱之灾  是吧
would set you up for life, did you?

29:34.850 --> 29:36.410
不想 先生
No, sir.

29:36.410 --> 29:38.980
我可以做任何事
I'm ready for anything.

29:38.980 --> 29:41.250
很好  那这件事就交给你了
Good. Then prepare for this.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.350
布鲁斯拿到"锡拉"回来之后
When Burrows brings Scylla back to us,

29:43.350 --> 29:47.880
我带着锡拉安全地飞回洛杉矶
I will fly it safely back to Los Angeles,

29:47.880 --> 29:52.280
而你要送他上西天
And you will be the one to put a bullet in his brain.

29:59.580 --> 30:02.080
莎拉
Sara?

30:06.850 --> 30:08.180
里面怎么了
What's going on in there?

30:08.180 --> 30:11.080
莎拉
Sara?

30:12.250 --> 30:13.510
你要干什么
What do you want?

30:13.520 --> 30:17.210
求你了  把门开着
Oh, please, keep that open.

30:17.210 --> 30:21.510
为什么  想要 对我横加指责  妄加评价吗
Why? So you can Lob more accusations and assumptions out at me?

30:21.520 --> 30:24.380
我没有
I haven't made any.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.820
林肯是领养的
Lincoln is adopted.

30:28.410 --> 30:33.580
还有  你怀孕了 你不否认  是吧
And you're pregnant. You don't deny it, do you?

30:34.410 --> 30:36.480
你应该告诉他
You should tell him.

30:37.410 --> 30:39.880
即使是现在  他也会很高兴的
He'd be happy, even under the circumstances.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.380
这不关你的事
It really isn't any of your business.

30:41.380 --> 30:42.410
对不起
I'm sorry.

30:42.410 --> 30:45.210
有的时候  姻亲之间
Sometimes in-laws

30:45.210 --> 30:47.820
也会冷血无情  但是...
Overstep their bounds, but...

30:49.010 --> 30:50.650
真正到了紧要关头
You know, when it comes right down to it,

30:50.650 --> 30:54.580
我和任何母亲都一样  所以...
I am the only mother any of you will ever have, so...

30:54.580 --> 30:57.410
你不该这么早就下定结论的
You shouldn't throw that away so easily.

30:57.410 --> 30:59.280
是啊  我从你身上学到
Yeah, you know, the only thing I get from you

30:59.280 --> 31:01.750
一个好例子  千万别做你这样的母亲
Is a great example of the mother I don't want to be.

31:03.250 --> 31:05.480
莎拉
Sara?

31:05.480 --> 31:08.380
我们没必要搞成这样
It doesn't have to be like this.

31:08.380 --> 31:09.380
有必要
Yeah, it does.

31:09.380 --> 31:11.950
你早就决定好了
That was your decision a long time ago.

31:11.950 --> 31:14.980
我能再给你 一点建议吗
Sara, Can I just give you One piece of advice?

31:18.010 --> 31:20.920
千万别酗酒
Stay out of the bars.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.310
说的好
That's good advice.

31:24.310 --> 31:31.180
我在嗜酒者互诫协会里有些朋友 都是酒鬼
I have friends in AA. They're only alcoholics.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.450
难以想象你要戒酒
I can only imagine what it's like for you,

31:33.450 --> 31:35.310
有多难
Trying to stay off the smack.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.680
是吗啡
It's morphine.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.950
医用吗啡
Hospital-grade morphine.

31:53.010 --> 31:55.710
我要监视这里和亚特兰大

31:55.720 --> 31:57.580
所有的机场和加油站
Between here and Atlanta.

31:57.580 --> 31:58.800
我还要所有
And I want the names of everyone 

31:58.800 --> 32:01.010
出席会议的人员名单
attending that conference.

32:01.010 --> 32:03.110
我就知道你会问这个问题
I thought you might be asking that question,

32:03.110 --> 32:05.080
所以我打电话到宾馆的前台
So I called the front desk of the hotel.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.610
说我是报社来的
Said I was from the newspaper.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.410
请原谅某些拼写错误
Excuse the spelling.

32:12.150 --> 32:13.550
这些都是科学家
These are all scientists.

32:13.550 --> 32:14.850
我早告诉过你
I told you.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.250
那些是演讲者
Those are the speakers.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.110
下面这些名字是"特别嘉宾"
The names below are "special guests."
