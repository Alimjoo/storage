WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.920
我在找一个叫林肯·布伦斯的人
I'm looking for Lincoln Burrows

00:04.930 --> 00:06.850
杀了副总统哥哥的凶手
Man killed the VP's brother

00:06.860 --> 00:08.490
为什么你要这么急着找布伦斯?
Why you want to see him?

00:08.500 --> 00:09.690
因为他是我哥哥
He's my brother

00:09.700 --> 00:11.690
-我正在想办法救你出去  -这不可能
-I'll get you out.  -It's impossible

00:11.700 --> 00:13.350
除非监狱是你设计的
Not if you designed the place

00:13.360 --> 00:15.050
你见过设计蓝图了?
You've seen the blueprints

00:15.060 --> 00:16.250
何止见过
 Better than that

00:16.260 --> 00:18.850
我把他们纹在了身上
I've got 'em on me

00:18.860 --> 00:21.150
尼克·萨维恩 
Nick Savrinn

00:21.160 --> 00:23.350
从现在开始,你们两个死定了
As of now, both of you are dead

00:23.360 --> 00:24.650
我是贝利克
This is Bellick

00:24.660 --> 00:26.020
我们这区已经被突破了
Our wing has been breached

00:26.030 --> 00:27.550
玛丽莲  不要!
Marilyn, no!

00:27.560 --> 00:29.750
在监狱里
The chair isn't the only way

00:29.760 --> 00:31.350
行刑不一定非得通过电椅
to take a man's life in prison

00:31.360 --> 00:33.550
-你干什么?  -即使你父亲早就有麻烦了
-What are you doing?  -Your father's already in trouble

00:33.560 --> 00:34.790
我们谁也帮不了他
There's nothing we can do about it

00:34.800 --> 00:37.270
快点! 我第一次做P.I.
Come on!My first assignments on PI were up here

00:37.280 --> 00:39.690
就是来这里清理有毒物质
cleaning out toxic mould

00:39.700 --> 00:41.020
P.I.到不了那里
PI didn't go there

00:41.030 --> 00:42.790
我们也从不派犯人去那里
We'd never assign inmates to do that

00:42.800 --> 00:44.750
泰勒·罗伯特
Tyler, Robert

00:44.760 --> 00:48.100
这一定是你女儿喽
And this here must be your daughter

00:48.130 --> 00:50.150
这事算成了 我们不再需要他了
It's over. We don't need him

00:50.160 --> 00:52.760
那你也不能杀了他
You're not gonna kill him

00:56.560 --> 01:00.300
团队利益
One for the team

01:03.360 --> 01:04.920
十七天后
(Michael) 17 days from now

01:04.930 --> 01:08.530
我哥哥将坐上电椅
they strap my brother to an electric chair

01:09.700 --> 01:12.120
电压高达5万伏的电流将通过他身体
Send 50,000 volts coursing through his body

01:12.130 --> 01:15.520
只因为一个莫须有的罪名
for a crime he didn't commit

01:15.530 --> 01:19.360
我是来这里救他的
I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen

01:21.830 --> 01:24.590
我来狐狸河监狱 差不多3个星期了
I've been in Fox River nearly three weeks now

01:24.600 --> 01:27.920
这期间  我已可以从我狱室后面出来
In that time,I've got out the back of my cell

01:27.930 --> 01:32.750
进入到横贯监狱的旧蒸汽管道
and into the old steam pipes that run beneath the prison

01:32.760 --> 01:37.100
这些管道就是出口
Those pipes are our way out

01:37.400 --> 01:38.850
把这个地方
Think of this place

01:38.860 --> 01:41.290
当作是美国地图
like it's a map of the US

01:41.300 --> 01:45.030
我们的狱室在那 那是纽约市
Our cell over there, that's New York City

01:45.200 --> 01:47.790
而医务室  我们的出口 那是加州
The infirmary, our exit, that's California

01:47.800 --> 01:49.890
我们脚下连贯这两地的...
The pipes beneath us that connect the two...

01:49.900 --> 01:51.320
是66大道
Route 66

01:51.330 --> 01:53.050
66大道
Route 66

01:53.060 --> 01:54.320
我们自由之车的车票
Our ticket out of here

01:54.330 --> 01:56.420
我猜是晚上行动吧
I assume we're doing this at night?

01:56.430 --> 01:57.820
对
That's right

01:57.830 --> 02:00.520
这里看守这么严实 嫩鸡 而你的老哥
We're locked up, fish,and your boy

02:00.530 --> 02:01.850
被单独监禁
is in solitary

02:01.860 --> 02:04.090
我们这些鸟儿 怎样才可以飞出笼子
How we just gonna fly out of our cages

02:04.100 --> 02:05.550
到你的狱室去呢?
and  right into your cell

02:05.560 --> 02:07.150
怎么去纽约市?
right into New York City?

02:07.160 --> 02:08.720
不用到我狱室
You're not

02:08.730 --> 02:11.490
我们到时会在半路会合的
You're gonna meet me halfway

02:11.500 --> 02:13.050
在圣路易?
In St Louis

02:13.060 --> 02:15.350
66大道在那楼下底部穿过
Route 66 runs beneath that building

02:15.360 --> 02:17.190
在这些管道上面
It's the only building

02:17.200 --> 02:18.350
只有这座楼
sitting on top of those tunnels

02:18.360 --> 02:21.790
我们只要趁做P.I.的时候
All we gotta do is get in there, on PI

02:21.800 --> 02:23.390
在那里弄一个出口
and dig ourselves an on-ramp

02:23.400 --> 02:26.090
很快  我们就到医务室
Shortly after, we hit the infirmary

02:26.100 --> 02:27.850
到时我们就会逃出监狱了
Then we'll be outside those walls

02:27.860 --> 02:29.690
那边是什么地方?
What's in there?

02:29.700 --> 02:31.320
是一个旧储物室
It's an old storage room

02:31.330 --> 02:33.320
约翰可以利用他在这里的关系
John here can pull all the stringsThere's gotta be some actual work to be done in there for me

02:33.330 --> 02:35.020
没那么容易  嫩鸡
(John) It's not that easy, fish

02:35.030 --> 02:37.710
那是禁区
That's a restricted area

02:37.720 --> 02:39.790
我得要有个借口 骗过狱警
I gotta be able to justify it to the bulls

02:39.800 --> 02:42.400
让他们派我们去那里干活
There's gotta be some actual work to be done in there for me

02:42.410 --> 02:43.490
以便可以进去
to get in there

02:43.500 --> 02:44.490
你明白吗?
You follow?

02:44.500 --> 02:45.820
那你尽快找到
Then you better figure it out

02:45.830 --> 02:48.290
因为若我们进不了那房子
Cos if we don't get in that room

02:48.300 --> 02:49.590
我们就出不去
we're not getting out of here.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.990
好像有什么瞒着我?
I'm feeling kind of left out

02:53.000 --> 02:54.550
纽约?  加州?
New York? California?

02:54.560 --> 02:56.420
圣路易?
St Louis?

02:56.430 --> 02:57.420
我们在谈什么呢?
What are we discussing?

02:57.430 --> 02:58.990
棒球而已
We're talking baseball, actually

02:59.000 --> 03:00.520
是吗?
Oh.

03:00.530 --> 03:02.420
关于这个话题
Now, that's a subject

03:02.430 --> 03:03.450
我恰巧有点了解
 I know quite a bit about.

03:03.460 --> 03:04.450
真可惜
What a shame

03:04.460 --> 03:06.420
我们说完了
 The conversation's over

03:06.430 --> 03:07.350
真的吗?
Really, now

03:07.360 --> 03:08.720
你们就这样
That any way

03:08.730 --> 03:12.360
对待一个队友的吗?
 to treat a team-mate?

03:14.260 --> 03:16.190
不管你们愿意与否
I'm coming along on this endeavour

03:16.200 --> 03:18.650
我是一定要和你们纠缠下去了
whether you like it or not

03:18.660 --> 03:19.890
况且我还有
Cos I got

03:19.900 --> 03:24.200
一副好嗓子
 a hell of a singing voice otherwise

03:24.800 --> 03:26.790
我不会带上这个贱人的
I won't take that piece of crap along

03:26.800 --> 03:27.790
一定不会
I won't do it

03:27.800 --> 03:29.420
我也不会
Me neither

03:29.430 --> 03:31.090
我们不必带上他的
We won't have to

03:31.100 --> 03:34.730
他很快就不会缠住我们了
He'll be out of the picture soon enough

03:36.260 --> 03:38.550
州政府提供了2万5千美元保险金
The state provides $25,000 insurance

03:38.560 --> 03:42.220
加上从伊利诺斯州惩教署职员基金会的捐款
plus donations from the Corrections Officers' Foundation...

03:42.230 --> 03:46.930
监狱长  我现在不关心这个
That's the last thing on my mind right now, Warden

03:47.260 --> 03:48.650
你找到凶手了吗?
Do you know who killed him?

03:48.660 --> 03:51.250
我们掌握了些线索
We have some leads

03:51.260 --> 03:52.690
但我可以向你保证
But I can promise you this

03:52.700 --> 03:56.760
我们决不会让凶手逍遥法外的
We are not gonna rest until we find out what happened

03:57.160 --> 03:58.750
他的照片不见了
His pictures are missing

03:58.760 --> 04:03.630
这里有我们女儿的照片
He had a photo of our daughter in here

04:04.160 --> 04:05.320
不用担心
Not to worry

04:05.330 --> 04:08.160
我们会查清楚的
 We'll find them

04:08.460 --> 04:11.950
我求过他
I begged him

04:11.960 --> 04:14.050
让他不要干这份工作
not to take this job

04:14.060 --> 04:15.520
莎尔娜
Shauna

04:15.530 --> 04:18.260
我很抱歉
I am so sorry

04:19.660 --> 04:22.250
我陪你出去坐车
I'll walk you to your car

04:22.260 --> 04:24.450
队长
Captain

04:24.460 --> 04:26.550
我要和你谈一下
 need to speak with you for a second

04:26.560 --> 04:30.060
走廊见
I'll meet you in the hallway

04:30.200 --> 04:33.990
我要抓到那个龟孙子凶手
I want the son of a bitch who did this

04:34.000 --> 04:37.890
不管你用什么办法 你都要把他找出来
Now, you do whatever you need to do to find him

04:37.900 --> 04:43.300
明白吗?
You understand?

04:44.630 --> 04:49.400
这有5个箱子  过来帮一下忙好吗?
We got five boxes.Wanna give me a hand?

04:49.700 --> 04:53.050
维罗妮卡?
Veronica

04:53.060 --> 04:54.450
那电话是典型的恐吓手段
That phone call was  tactics scare

04:54.460 --> 04:55.950
他们就想吓一下你
That's they want.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.890
让我们望而生畏
They want to scare us from doing what they know we can do

04:57.900 --> 05:00.300
-那该怎么做?  -把他们曝光
-And what's that?  -Expose them

05:00.310 --> 05:03.020
多诺万小姐  这家伙又来烦你了吗?
Is this guy bothering you again?  Miss Donovan?

05:03.030 --> 05:05.120
不 卢卡斯 那个晚上是我的过错
No, Lukasz, the other night was my fault

05:05.130 --> 05:06.220
是个误会
It was a misunderstanding

05:06.230 --> 05:08.190
如果你有什么需要
OK. But if you need anything...

05:08.200 --> 05:09.090
相信我
Trust me

05:09.100 --> 05:12.020
要有事我第一个找你
you'll be the first person I call

05:12.030 --> 05:16.730
让我来
Here, let me

05:17.730 --> 05:19.550
这些箱子
Those boxes

05:19.560 --> 05:20.550
装着七年来
contain seven years

05:20.560 --> 05:22.250
上诉案件的档案
of criminal appellant work

05:22.260 --> 05:25.220
如果有先例
If there's a precedent in there somewhere

05:25.230 --> 05:28.320
可以使得林肯的死刑缓期执行 我们一定可以找到的
that can help us suspend Lincoln's execution,we're gonna find it

05:28.330 --> 05:30.190
你可以放到门边  卢卡斯
You can leave those by the door

05:30.200 --> 05:31.190
我会搬进去的
I'll bring them in

05:31.200 --> 05:32.350
好的
Oh, that's OK

05:32.360 --> 05:34.150
我这里有你的钥匙
I've got your key right here

05:34.160 --> 05:37.200
如果我不知情 还以为卢卡斯痴情于你呢
If I didn't know better,I'd say Lukasz was sweet on you.

05:37.210 --> 05:38.460
有趣
Very funny

06:28.490 --> 06:30.080
火
Fire

06:30.090 --> 06:31.080
什么?
 What?

06:31.090 --> 06:33.050
用火  我们把那地方烧为平地
Fire. We burn the place down

06:33.060 --> 06:34.650
对我们有什么用?
How's that gonna help us?

06:34.660 --> 06:36.200
几年前  礼拜堂发生大火
A few years ago, the chapel burnt down

06:36.210 --> 06:38.450
惩教署意识到
 and the DOC realised

06:38.460 --> 06:40.580
有一些有毒物质
they had some toxic issues

06:40.590 --> 06:43.110
像石棉  导火线
You know, asbestos, lead paint, you name it

06:43.120 --> 06:44.480
他们找不到承包商来清理
They couldn't find a contractor

06:44.490 --> 06:47.480
所以他们派狱犯来做
so they put the inmates on the job

06:47.490 --> 06:49.910
每次我们都在那呆5-6小时
We spent, like, five, six hours in there at a time

06:49.920 --> 06:51.450
但有一点比较好的是
But the good news is

06:51.460 --> 06:54.280
基本上没有守卫来巡逻
no guards came around almost at all

06:54.290 --> 06:57.210
你有办法带我们到那吗?
Can you get us in there?

06:57.220 --> 07:02.260
我仔细考虑过了
I've been doing a little, uh... thinking

07:06.120 --> 07:10.220
我要一张P.I.的工作证
I'm gonna need a PI card, aren't I?

07:10.490 --> 07:12.810
我是说
I mean

07:12.820 --> 07:14.610
那边是起事的地方 
that's where this whole thing is happening

07:14.620 --> 07:15.780
对吗?
isn't it?

07:15.790 --> 07:19.460
很快就给你
It's on its way

07:20.560 --> 07:22.180
你在敷衍我  对吗?
You're slow-walking me, aren't you?

07:22.190 --> 07:23.980
我为什么要这么做?
Why would I do that?

07:23.990 --> 07:25.610
你觉得贝利克会因狱警鲍勃那件事
You think Bellick's gonna pop me

07:25.620 --> 07:28.580
把我抓起来
for shanking that CO, Bob

07:28.590 --> 07:30.010
也许
Maybe

07:30.020 --> 07:32.180
你们会悄悄跑去告诉他  对吗?
you'll take a little walk, tell him for yourself?

07:32.190 --> 07:34.180
这样你们就可以摆脱我了
And I'll be out of here for good

07:34.190 --> 07:36.810
我有你的一些秘密
Well, I got news for you

07:36.820 --> 07:39.710
如果我因杀了鲍勃被抓起来
If I go down for killing Bob

07:39.720 --> 07:42.480
我不会就此作罢的
believe me,I'm gonna take a little walk of my own

07:42.490 --> 07:48.690
我会向他们禀明 你在你便池后面挖的洞
Tell 'em about that hole you got behind your toilet

07:49.820 --> 07:52.880
这么说来...
So...

07:52.890 --> 07:55.910
P.I.的工作证怎样?
How about that PI card?

07:55.920 --> 07:58.380
你还记得吗
I don't know if you remember

07:58.390 --> 08:01.080
在5年级的那个夏天
but that summer before fifth grade

08:01.090 --> 08:03.110
我和你住了两星期时
when I stayed with you a couple weeks

08:03.120 --> 08:07.590
你认为我打烂了玻璃咖啡桌
and you thought I broke your glass coffee table?

08:08.690 --> 08:10.880
你回家时  我否认了
And when you came home, I denied it

08:10.890 --> 08:13.680
但你告诉我
But you told me

08:13.690 --> 08:17.350
对咖啡桌你可以不在乎
you could care less about the coffee table

08:17.360 --> 08:19.310
但你不想我因此撒谎
you just didn't want me lying to you

08:19.320 --> 08:21.880
你说我说出事实
And you said I'd feel a lot better

08:21.890 --> 08:24.780
会觉得舒服点的
if I just told you the truth

08:24.790 --> 08:26.980
而你保证不会生气
And you promised not to be angry

08:26.990 --> 08:28.680
我记得
I remember

08:28.690 --> 08:31.680
对  是我打烂的
Well, I broke it

08:31.690 --> 08:36.060
我知道
I know

08:37.690 --> 08:39.780
如果你心里
You know, if there's anything

08:39.790 --> 08:41.410
有什么要说
that you want to get off your chest

08:41.420 --> 08:43.250
你可以告诉我
you can tell me

08:43.260 --> 08:45.710
我也保证不会生气
And I promise I won't get angry

08:45.720 --> 08:49.490
你想知道是不是我杀了那人
You want to know if I killed that guy

08:52.390 --> 08:59.480
当时我去那里  是想干点坏事
I, uh, went there planning to do something wrong

08:59.490 --> 09:01.480
但我没杀那个人
But I didn't kill that guy

09:01.490 --> 09:04.650
有人蓄意制造了我杀人的假象
Someone's working hard to make it look like I did

09:04.660 --> 09:08.980
不管怎样  仍有机会不用执行死刑
Anyway, there's a chance the execution may not happen

09:08.990 --> 09:10.480
什么?
What?

09:10.490 --> 09:12.080
维罗妮卡正在帮我
Veronica's working on my case

09:12.090 --> 09:13.610
今天有个记者来找我
and I got a reporter coming today

09:13.620 --> 09:16.510
她相信我是无辜的
who believes I'm innocent

09:16.520 --> 09:19.390
因此我还不用死
So I ain't dead yet

09:20.220 --> 09:23.650
LJ  看着我
LJ. Look at me

09:23.660 --> 09:26.750
你要有信念  孩子
You gotta have faith, kid

09:26.760 --> 09:31.490
坚持你的信念
Just have a little faith

09:37.990 --> 09:40.310
凯勒曼
Kellerman

09:40.320 --> 09:41.350
怎样了?
 Well?

09:41.360 --> 09:42.310
搞定了
Taken care of

09:42.320 --> 09:43.710
很好
Good

09:43.720 --> 09:45.610
现在进行第二步计划
Now move on to the second thing

09:45.620 --> 09:47.650
如果你见到我们在看的东西
If you could see what we're looking at...

09:47.660 --> 09:49.180
相信我  布伦斯会收到信息的
believe me,Burrows is gonna get the message

09:49.190 --> 09:52.280
这个你向我保证过了
Which is what you've assured me of before

09:52.290 --> 09:53.300
而这信息
Yet that message

09:53.310 --> 09:55.710
总是退回到发送者
keeps getting returned to sender

09:55.720 --> 09:58.380
现在着手第二步计划 然后向我报告
Now move on the second thing and report back

09:58.390 --> 10:00.410
我们现在去
We're headed there now

10:00.420 --> 10:02.650
你想得太多了
You're thinking too much

10:02.660 --> 10:06.090
是啊  但没办法
Yeah. God forbid

10:10.190 --> 10:12.180
在找到那个杀手之前
He'll toss every cell in this block

10:12.190 --> 10:13.950
他会将整个监狱挖地三尺
until he finds the killer

10:13.960 --> 10:15.250
他找到这里时
He tosses this one

10:15.260 --> 10:17.650
他会轻易找到后面那个洞的
he'll find the hole back there in a heartbeat

10:17.660 --> 10:20.110
我知道
I know

10:20.120 --> 10:21.410
我们得举报他
 We got to turn T-Bag in

10:21.420 --> 10:22.880
只有这样做才会停止搜查
That's the only way it'll stop

10:22.890 --> 10:25.590
我们若举报他 他会泄漏我们的秘密
 We turn him in, he'll talk

10:30.220 --> 10:35.190
看来无论怎样都是死路一条  对吗?
So we're screwed either way, aren't we?

10:38.890 --> 10:40.650
哪个房间?
Which one?

10:40.660 --> 10:41.750
就在那
Right there

10:41.760 --> 10:45.360
圣路易
St Louis

11:07.390 --> 11:09.910
你们来这干什么?!
What the hell are you doing here?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.680
清理工作队 我们以为这是储物室
Cleanup detail. We thought this was storage

11:11.690 --> 11:12.850
这像是个储物室吗
This look like storage to you?

11:12.860 --> 11:14.550
白痴 这是禁区
idiot  It's a restricted area

11:14.560 --> 11:16.010
这是狱警休息室
 a CO break room

11:16.020 --> 11:17.250
退出去!
Now back it up

11:17.260 --> 11:18.580
给我退出去!
 Back it up, now!

11:18.590 --> 11:20.850
对不起
Sorry, Officer

11:20.860 --> 11:23.890
这种情况不会再发生了
It won't happen again

11:35.760 --> 11:37.480
他妈的休息室
A freakin' break room?

11:37.490 --> 11:39.780
你在开玩笑吧?
 Are you kidding me?

11:39.790 --> 11:41.980
房子翻新后他们一定换了房间
They must have changed it since the retrofit

11:41.990 --> 11:43.010
狱警就守在那里
The bulls are camped out in there.

11:43.020 --> 11:44.010
他们不会离开的
They'll never leave.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.110
你有后备计划吗?
Got a backup plan?

11:45.120 --> 11:46.110
没有
There isn't one

11:46.120 --> 11:47.150
在管道上面
It's the only room

11:47.160 --> 11:48.180
只有这个房间
on top of that pipe

11:48.190 --> 11:49.350
这是出去的唯一方法
It's the only way out,

11:49.360 --> 11:50.380
我们还得折回那里
We gotta get back in there

11:50.390 --> 11:51.780
没可能  嫩鸡
Impossible, fish

11:51.790 --> 11:55.160
未必  过来看看
Maybe not. Check it out

11:57.090 --> 11:58.580
我不懂你说什么
I don't get it

11:58.590 --> 11:59.750
他怎么可以进去?
How come they let him in?

11:59.760 --> 12:00.810
他是囚犯理事
He's a trustee

12:00.820 --> 12:02.250
拥有很高的安全权限
Ones with high security clearance

12:02.260 --> 12:03.410
为什么是他?
 Why him?

12:03.420 --> 12:05.210
他们信得过他 
He can be trusted.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.210
怎么才可以成为囚犯理事?
 How does one become a trustee?

12:06.220 --> 12:07.380
只要三十年来没有不良记录
Have a spotless record for the last 30 years

12:07.390 --> 12:08.580
没不良记录
for the last 30 years

12:08.590 --> 12:10.110
我们的刑期加起来都没这么多
Pretty much counts us out

12:10.120 --> 12:12.110
看来得让他加入我们
Which means we've gotta get him on board

12:12.120 --> 12:17.120
算了吧 他不领任何人的情的
Forget it. The guy's a boy scout

12:21.860 --> 12:24.050
韦斯特莫兰德 先生?
Mr Westmoreland

12:24.060 --> 12:26.050
你好 迈克尔
Hey, Michael

12:26.060 --> 12:28.710
找到你的猫了吗?
You found your cat yet?

12:28.720 --> 12:32.210
还没
Still MIA

12:32.220 --> 12:33.410
你可以另找一只
You could always get another

12:33.420 --> 12:36.310
我并不想要其他的
I don't want another

12:36.320 --> 12:37.710
而且那样毫无意义
Besides, it's a moot point

12:37.720 --> 12:39.410
她已经在我心中根深蒂固
She was grandfathered

12:39.420 --> 12:41.410
她不在了 也不要别的宠物
Once she's gone, no more pets

12:41.420 --> 12:44.210
如果你出狱了  这就不是个问题了
Wouldn't be an issue if you were on the outside

12:44.220 --> 12:47.650
还在打那个主意啊?
Still tugging on that leash, eh?

12:47.660 --> 12:49.580
是的
Yup

12:49.590 --> 12:51.380
而这一次
And this is the part

12:51.390 --> 12:53.580
我正式向你发出邀请
where I extend a formal invitation

12:53.590 --> 12:55.880
你仍觉得我是大盗库珀么?
Cos you still think I'm DB Cooper?

12:55.890 --> 12:59.210
我不是觉得  是知道
I don't think. I know

12:59.220 --> 13:00.880
据我所知
The way I see it

13:00.890 --> 13:02.810
由于你开车撞死人
you're in here doing 60 to life

13:02.820 --> 13:04.210
被判60年至终身监禁
for vehicular manslaughter

13:04.220 --> 13:06.110
原该判你20年
It would have been 20

13:06.120 --> 13:07.810
但你的车是偷来的
but the car you were in was stolen

13:07.820 --> 13:10.610
变成犯另一重罪的谋杀
Felony murder rule cubes every sentence

13:10.620 --> 13:11.780
所以你还在这里
And here you are

13:11.790 --> 13:14.910
撞死那个女人是个意外
Hitting that woman was an accident

13:14.920 --> 13:16.750
但那车?
But the car?

13:16.760 --> 13:18.610
没人会无缘无故偷车的
No one accidentally steals a car

13:18.620 --> 13:20.410
问题就出现在这
So the question is

13:20.420 --> 13:23.510
为什么查尔斯 韦斯特莫兰德会
why would Charles Westmoreland be in Arizona boosting a car

13:23.520 --> 13:26.380
在他住处十个州外
ten states away from where he lived

13:26.390 --> 13:28.480
离墨西哥边境10英里远的亚利桑拿州开车狂飚呢?
and only ten miles from the Mexican border

13:28.490 --> 13:30.110
还有  为什么事情发生的两天前
And why, two days before that

13:30.120 --> 13:31.850
有人从波特兰一汽车旅馆
would someone make a phone call

13:31.860 --> 13:34.250
打电话给他妻子
to his wife from a motel in Portland

13:34.260 --> 13:37.280
而这旅馆恰巧在飞机场附近呢?
a stone's throw away from the airport out of which

13:37.290 --> 13:38.710
而电话后不久
 shortly after

13:38.720 --> 13:41.780
305航班被一个叫库珀的人劫持
flight 305 was hijacked by one DB Cooper

13:41.790 --> 13:44.180
飞机被劫后七小时
Seven hours after the hijacking

13:44.190 --> 13:47.380
记录表明查尔斯 韦斯特莫兰德
records show Charles Westmoreland

13:47.390 --> 13:49.680
因膝盖受伤在杨百翰市一家小诊所受过治疗
was treated for a busted knee at a free clinic in Brigham City

13:49.690 --> 13:51.210
七小时内  要从波特兰  俄勒冈
Only way to get from Portland, Oregon to Brigham City

13:51.220 --> 13:53.810
到犹他州的杨百翰市
Utah in seven hours

13:53.820 --> 13:57.680
除了开一辆打破世界记录的汽车
is in a car breaking every land speed record

13:57.690 --> 14:00.150
还有就是坐飞机
known to man,or flying

14:00.160 --> 14:02.210
大家都知道库珀
It's public record DB Cooper

14:02.220 --> 14:04.610
在起飞后一小时从那架727飞机跳出
jumped out of that 727 about an hour after take off

14:04.620 --> 14:05.980
在10000英尺的高空
Taking a dive at 10,000 feet

14:05.990 --> 14:09.580
拿着150万美金  跳了伞
with 1.5 million in cash

14:09.590 --> 14:11.980
而降落伞是仓促中装备的
and a hastily packed parachute

14:11.990 --> 14:13.810
可能降落得很不理想
might make for a pretty rough landing

14:13.820 --> 14:15.550
不理想到摔坏了骨头
Rough enough to shatter some bones

14:15.560 --> 14:17.310
可能就是左膝
Maybe even a left knee

14:17.320 --> 14:21.380
落地时  库珀将安排车来接他
DB Cooper would have had a car waiting for him

14:21.390 --> 14:24.110
根据1971年DMV记录
According to DMV records, in 1971

14:24.120 --> 14:27.980
查尔斯·韦斯特莫兰德很荣幸的 是一辆65年产雪佛莱的主人
Charles Westmoreland was the proud owner of a 65 Chevy Nova

14:27.990 --> 14:31.550
而在阿利桑那州边界 发现一辆65年产的雪佛莱
As it happens, a 65 Chevy Nova

14:31.560 --> 14:32.980
车牌已被刮花
with the registration number scraped off

14:32.990 --> 14:35.210
被抛弃在一旁
was found abandoned with a blown gasket

14:35.220 --> 14:36.950
气缸爆了
along the Arizona border

14:36.960 --> 14:40.910
就在你用偷来的车 撞到那女人的地方
a mile or two away from where you accidentally hit that woman

14:40.920 --> 14:44.320
一两里开外
with your stolen car

14:45.260 --> 14:47.180
这故事有意思
Interesting story

14:47.190 --> 14:49.250
这人更有意思
Interesting man

14:49.260 --> 14:52.510
但有一点你解释不了
But you didn't answer one thing

14:52.520 --> 14:54.050
是什么?
What's that?

14:54.060 --> 14:57.510
可能我确实伤到了膝盖
Maybe I did hurt my knee

14:57.520 --> 15:00.310
我确实偷了车
I did steal that car

15:00.320 --> 15:03.180
我也确实意外的撞了那可怜的女人
and I did accidentally hit that poor lady

15:03.190 --> 15:08.500
但是我11月24日
But how could I have hijacked a plane in Portland on November 24th

15:08.510 --> 15:10.080
我因为醉酒闹事被判监禁30天
when I was in Folsom

15:10.090 --> 15:14.890
又怎么能去波特兰劫持飞机呢?
finishing up a 30-day drunk and disorderly?

15:17.790 --> 15:21.410
我希望你不要把所有的越狱希望 都寄托在那笔钱上
I hope you weren't hanging this whole escape on that money

15:21.420 --> 15:25.060
因为我不是拥有者
cos I'm not the one in possession of it

15:27.320 --> 15:30.420
不过还是谢谢你的邀请
Thanks for the invite, though

15:45.260 --> 15:48.360
维罗妮卡
Veronica

15:50.090 --> 15:53.820
维罗妮卡  别这样
Veronica, come on

15:57.820 --> 15:58.980
我们没事了
We're OK

15:58.990 --> 16:01.950
这怎么算没事呢  尼克?
How is this OK, Nick?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.850
有人要杀我们
Somebody just tried to kill us

16:03.860 --> 16:05.980
-我知道  我在现场  -那就不要当作没事  好吗?
-I know. I was there.  -Then act like it,OK?

16:05.990 --> 16:10.450
我们眼睁睁的看着一个人 在我们面前被烧死
We just watched a man burn to death right in front of us

16:10.460 --> 16:13.660
我的天
My God

16:13.890 --> 16:16.450
卢卡斯   我的天啊
Lukasz... My God

16:16.460 --> 16:18.410
没事了  没事了  没事了
It's OK. It's OK

16:18.420 --> 16:19.850
我们居然抛下他不管
We just left him there

16:19.860 --> 16:24.490
我们为他做什么都于事无补 他一开门就没了命
There was nothing we could do.He was dead as soon as he opened the door

16:24.500 --> 16:27.200
我很想弄清楚这一切怎么回事 尼克
I am trying so hard to understand all this,Nick.

16:27.210 --> 16:29.410
这些人到底是谁  他们想干什么
Who these people are, what they want

16:29.420 --> 16:31.490
我们怎么可以不报警就离开那里了呢?
How we walked away without calling the police

16:31.500 --> 16:35.480
我们这么做是因为我们惹的 这些人不杀了我们是不会罢手的
We did it because these people we're dealing with won't stop until we're dead

16:35.490 --> 16:37.850
现在  如果他们认为我们死了 就像现在我们看上去好像是死了一样
If they think we're dead  like they do right now,

16:37.860 --> 16:40.490
可能我们就有点喘息的空间 我们来想想下一步怎么做
maybe we get a little breathing room here, we figure out what our next move is.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.690
不  我们应该去报警
We should go to the police

16:41.700 --> 16:43.350
我一直以来也是像你那样想的
I've been thinking the same thing

16:43.360 --> 16:48.260
但是  你知道吗 警察是斗不过他们的
But you know what?They're bigger than the police

16:48.560 --> 16:51.680
如果我们去报警 我们这么做
We go to the authorities and all we're gonna be doing

16:51.690 --> 16:53.780
就是告诉他们我们还活着
it's broadcast to them that we're still alive

16:53.790 --> 16:57.990
这样  我们又成为他们暗杀的目标了
and then we got that target right on our backs again

16:58.360 --> 16:59.880
我们不能永远躲下去
We can't hide forever

16:59.890 --> 17:01.980
不  不  可能不必永远躲
No, no. Maybe not forever

17:01.990 --> 17:04.510
不过我知道有个地方
But...I think I know a place we can

17:04.520 --> 17:08.120
可以让我们躲一阵子
at least for a little while

17:10.720 --> 17:13.180
我们只须自己混进去了
We just have to go in there ourselves then

17:13.190 --> 17:16.080
我说了  除非那老人加入 否则是不可能的
Like I said,unless the old man's in it's not possible

17:16.090 --> 17:18.280
而且即使可以进去 那里有守卫
And even if it were, the guards in there

17:18.290 --> 17:20.510
不会看不见我们在他们眼皮底下纵火
won't just sit back and watch us start a fire

17:20.520 --> 17:22.580
这点我已经想到解决办法
See, I already figured that part out

17:22.590 --> 17:23.880
我一直在想的
I been thinking

17:23.890 --> 17:25.500
怎么解决?
 And?

17:25.920 --> 17:28.350
还记得你在主教的办公室做的那事吗?
That thing you're doing in the Pope's office

17:28.360 --> 17:29.480
使用橡胶粘合剂?
You using rubber cement?

17:29.490 --> 17:30.200
然后?
Yeah

17:30.210 --> 17:32.410
-你能弄点出来吗?  -也许可以  为什么这么问?
-Can you get some out?  -Maybe. Why?

17:32.420 --> 17:35.250
守卫室有个咖啡壶  对吗?
Look, there's a coffee maker in the guards' room, right?

17:35.260 --> 17:36.000
我认识一位朋友
I got a hook-up

17:36.000 --> 17:38.710
在厨房里面干活
with one of my boys in the kitchen

17:38.720 --> 17:41.810
如果我们能涂点橡胶粘合剂在咖啡壶底部
If we can get rubber cement in the bottom of that coffee pot

17:41.820 --> 17:44.690
加热装置一打开...
when the burner goes on...

17:45.020 --> 17:47.380
这主意不错
It's a good idea

17:47.390 --> 17:49.050
但没有韦斯特莫兰德
But without Westmoreland

17:49.060 --> 17:51.010
我们进不去那房子的
we're never getting in that room

17:51.020 --> 17:52.410
他不想成为出逃的一份子?
 He doesn't want any part of this?

17:52.420 --> 17:53.510
不想
 No

17:53.520 --> 17:54.980
那他想要什么?
Then what does he want?

17:54.990 --> 17:57.610
他必有所求
He's gotta want something

17:57.620 --> 18:01.920
每个人都有其所求
Everybody wants something

18:08.500 --> 18:10.500
过来
come on

18:16.500 --> 18:18.000
真乖
That's a good girl.

18:26.290 --> 18:29.420
真想不到
I don't believe it

18:29.960 --> 18:30.660
谢谢
Thank you

18:30.660 --> 18:32.080
不客气
You're welcome

18:32.090 --> 18:33.310
你在哪里找到她的?
Where'd you find her?

18:33.320 --> 18:35.110
在礼拜堂旁边的院子里
In the yard, by the chapel

18:35.120 --> 18:40.010
为什么我感觉像有什么企图
Why do I get the feeling there's a string attached to this?

18:40.020 --> 18:44.590
没什么企图  举手之劳
Not a string. Just a favour

18:46.320 --> 18:48.210

18:48.220 --> 18:49.980
没关系
That's all right

18:49.990 --> 18:52.580
因为我想要做的
Cos it's not gonna take DB Cooper

18:52.590 --> 18:54.410
不必拜托到  库珀

and turn the burner on

19:03.820 --> 19:05.450
为什么要这么做?
Why?

19:05.460 --> 19:07.850
如果那里失火的话
Let's just say it'd be in everyone's best interests

19:07.860 --> 19:09.850
我想这对大家都最好不过了
if a fire were to start in there

19:09.860 --> 19:13.510

我没事
I'm fine

你跟P.I.去过水管槽隙
you had been up in the crawlspace for PI

20:34.760 --> 20:40.390

and PI was never assigned to go there

20:43.260 --> 20:45.110
针打完了  对吗?
We're done here, right?

I'm going to the police

25:11.670 --> 25:13.490
报警?
The police

25:13.500 --> 25:15.130
我想这不是个好主意  LJ
I don't think that's such a good idea, LJ

25:15.140 --> 25:18.060
我是说  手枪上有了你的指纹
with your prints on the murder weapon and all

令弹道专家相信你的话

25:26.640 --> 25:28.730

25:39.040 --> 25:41.730
吸毒  学校表现差
drug use, decline in academic performance

25:41.740 --> 25:42.890
真没想到
But we didn't think

25:42.900 --> 25:43.860
他会这么做
he'd do this

25:43.870 --> 25:45.230
没人会信的
 No one's gonna believe that

25:45.240 --> 25:46.760
他们会信的
Yes, they will

他们抓到你时 他们会抓到你的...LJ
And when they catch you, and they will

25:48.800 --> 25:50.260
他们会把你 当作成年人来拷问的
they'll try you as an adult

25:50.270 --> 25:51.290
你知道那意味着什么吗?
You know what that means?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.060
我们可以帮你  LJ

25:53.070 --> 25:54.660
我们是你的唯一希望
We're the only hope you got

25:54.670 --> 25:57.300
不  不是的
No, you're not

26:05.440 --> 26:09.090
是她自找的
She made that choice, not you

26:09.100 --> 26:13.070
我们去找那孩子
Let's find the kid

26:16.330 --> 26:20.990
你找回你的玛丽莲了?

26:31.030 --> 26:33.530
你不介意的  对吗?
You don't mind, do you?

我和你一向很好  查尔斯
I feel a kinship with you, Charles

26:48.300 --> 26:53.120
比跟其他囚犯好
More than any other con here

26:53.130 --> 26:56.450

27:02.500 --> 27:04.890
我一向待你不薄

27:04.900 --> 27:07.790
我一直很感激这点
I've always appreciated that fact

27:07.800 --> 27:13.160
自鲍勃他18岁起  我就认识他了
I'd known Bob since he was 18 years old

27:13.330 --> 27:16.490
这工作是我找给他的
I got him this job

27:16.500 --> 27:21.220
你可以想像我有多么愧疚
You can imagine how responsible I feel

27:21.230 --> 27:23.390
我帮不了你  长官
I can't help you with that, boss

27:23.400 --> 27:25.720
我觉得你可以

27:28.660 --> 27:32.030
事情发生时  你在场
And you were right here when it happened

27:35.360 --> 27:38.920
我们在这打滚这么多年
We've both been around long

27:38.930 --> 27:43.120
都知道  一个囚犯若告密
enough to know that when a con starts that snitching business

27:43.130 --> 27:46.120
他是自寻死路
he's not long for this world

27:46.130 --> 27:49.060
不要让我难做  长官
Don't put me in that position, boss

27:55.960 --> 28:03.820
我离开狱室前  你若不告诉我谁杀了鲍勃
If you don't tell me who killed Bob before I leave this cell

28:03.830 --> 28:07.930
我们的交情就到此为止
our friendship goes with it

28:14.300 --> 28:17.630
这猫不错
That's a nice cat

28:23.000 --> 28:24.820
韦斯特莫兰德知道
Westmoreland knows

28:24.830 --> 28:29.100
而他嘴巴不太严
And his jaw ain't that strong

29:13.600 --> 29:16.650

What's this?

29:16.660 --> 29:19.150
没什么
Nothing

29:19.160 --> 29:21.320
你暗恋人家

我没有

29:22.660 --> 29:24.260

29:24.260 --> 29:25.650
想不明白
I don't get it

29:25.660 --> 29:27.250
不明白什么?
What is there to get?

29:27.260 --> 29:30.220
他上面的资料不符  对吗?
He doesn't fit the profile.Right?

29:30.230 --> 29:31.420
这人大学毕业
The man's got a graduate degree

29:31.430 --> 29:34.420
他住在我家附近

29:36.100 --> 29:37.320
喝纯正威士忌
They drink single malt scotch.

29:37.330 --> 29:39.090
花200美元买棒球队季票
they pay $200 for Cubs tickets

29:39.100 --> 29:40.420
他们没必要抢银行的
They don't rob banks

29:40.430 --> 29:42.620
也许他买不起季度票
Maybe he couldn't afford season tickets

29:42.630 --> 29:45.450
也许那就是他抢银行的原因
Maybe that's why he robbed the bank

29:45.460 --> 29:47.950
谢谢  不过我是说真的
Thank you. I'm actually being serious

29:47.960 --> 29:49.790

Can I ask you something?

29:49.800 --> 29:50.790
可以

29:50.800 --> 29:53.620
为什么你这么关心这个?
Why do you care so much?

29:53.630 --> 29:55.120
因为他对我说谎了
Cos he lied to me

29:55.130 --> 29:59.700
男人都在说谎
They all lie to you

30:02.960 --> 30:07.450
也许这儿真正谈上心的只有他
Maybe because he's the one guy in here I can actually get to

30:07.460 --> 30:09.920
只有他
The one guy

30:09.930 --> 30:12.790
我能不同对待
I can make a difference with

30:12.800 --> 30:14.890

30:14.900 --> 30:17.820
你再这么自寻烦恼
You keep burning it at both ends like this

30:17.830 --> 30:21.150
会把自己折磨到疯的
you're gonna drive yourself crazy

Good night

30:26.000 --> 30:28.150
很遗憾  布伦斯
I'm sorry, Burrows

30:28.160 --> 30:29.450
救护人员赶到时
Both of them were dead

30:29.460 --> 30:32.800
他们两人都死了
by the time the paramedics got there

30:33.000 --> 30:34.820
我的儿子呢?
What about my son?

30:34.830 --> 30:36.320
他失踪了
He's missing

30:36.330 --> 30:40.150
警察正视他为逃犯
Police are treating him as a fugitive

30:40.160 --> 30:41.350
逃犯?
Fugitive?

30:41.360 --> 30:44.860
凶器上有他指纹
They found his prints on the murder weapon

30:45.100 --> 30:46.250
不可能
That's impossible

30:46.260 --> 30:50.050
我...我要打电话给他
I... I, uh...  I need to call him

30:50.060 --> 30:51.520
不  我做不到
No, I can't do that

30:51.530 --> 30:52.950
你什么意思? 你做不到?
What do you mean?You can't do that?

30:52.960 --> 30:54.520
-他就要没命了  -布伦斯
-His life's in danger!Look, -Burrows.

30:54.530 --> 30:56.590
警察和我说明了
The police instructed me that

30:56.600 --> 30:58.590
案件正在调查中
this is an ongoing investigation

30:58.600 --> 31:02.120
你和你儿子这样的联系
And as such, any contact you make with your son

31:02.130 --> 31:08.130
可能会帮助和教唆他潜逃
could potentially aid and abet him as a fugitive

31:08.430 --> 31:09.820
对不起
I'm sorry

31:09.830 --> 31:14.130
狱长  拜托了
Warden, please!

31:31.330 --> 31:34.320
走吧
Let's go

31:34.330 --> 31:35.450
真可怜
That's messed up, man

31:35.460 --> 31:37.120
他知道了吗?
Jeez. Does he even know?

31:37.130 --> 31:38.390
我想还没
I don't think so

31:38.400 --> 31:42.400
他在这儿
Go ahead, toss 'em

32:14.630 --> 32:18.430
有事么?T
What's up, T?

32:18.600 --> 32:21.920
我们是好兄弟  对吗?
We're family, right?

32:21.930 --> 32:23.920
对
Hell, yeah. We are

32:23.930 --> 32:28.220
我现在有麻烦  我需要你帮忙
Well, I'm in a quandary and I need your help

32:28.230 --> 32:30.120
说说

32:30.130 --> 32:32.790
贝利克在这里的搜索越来越紧了
Bellick's squeezing tighter and tighter round here

32:32.800 --> 32:34.790
你说得对
You're right .Eventually

32:34.800 --> 32:35.990
总会有人告密的
somebody's mouth is gonna start moving

32:36.000 --> 32:37.720
而现在
Thing is

32:37.730 --> 32:39.550
洛奇  如果我因这个被抓
Trokey, if I get popped for this

32:39.560 --> 32:41.550
加上我的前科
what with my priors

32:41.560 --> 32:47.720
还有我的暴力倾向行为背景
and predisposition to violent behaviour...

32:47.730 --> 32:49.920
我一辈子都要呆在这儿了
I'll spend the rest of my life in the SHU

32:49.930 --> 32:52.450
但如果你自首认了
But if you come forward

32:52.460 --> 32:55.890
以你只有毒品的前科
with only a drug conviction

32:55.900 --> 32:58.550
再加上你是主动自首...
and a whole lotta remorse...

32:58.560 --> 32:59.550
我做不到  帝博格
I can't do that

32:59.560 --> 33:00.990
-我还没说完  -不用说了
-I ain't finished.  -No need.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.790
我又没杀人  凭什么替你顶罪
I ain't going down for murdering no hack

33:02.800 --> 33:05.590
你能理解的  对吗?
I mean, you understand that, don't you?

33:05.600 --> 33:09.600
你不会生我气吧?
You ain't mad, are you?

33:11.260 --> 33:16.530
是的  洛奇 我不会生你气的
No, Trokey. I'm not mad

34:35.160 --> 34:36.350
我要出去  我要去找他
I need out. I gotta find him

34:36.360 --> 34:38.020

You will

34:38.030 --> 34:40.090
一起出去  很快
Both of us. Soon

34:40.100 --> 34:42.020
他们在害我的家人  迈克尔
They're coming after my family,Michael.

34:42.030 --> 34:43.250
你要相信我
You gotta trust me

34:43.260 --> 34:44.420

告诉我  迈克尔  告诉我
Tell me, Michael. Tell me

34:48.030 --> 34:49.690
你出不去的  对吗?
You can't, can you?

34:49.700 --> 34:51.350
我现在就要出去
I gotta get outta here now

34:51.360 --> 34:52.520

How about it?

34:56.130 --> 34:58.900
相信我
Just stick with me

35:08.730 --> 35:12.430
布鲁斯  你好!
Yo, Bruce. Hey

35:37.930 --> 35:39.520
如果你从那出去
If you go out there

35:39.530 --> 35:40.720
他们会枪杀你的
they will gun you down

35:40.730 --> 35:42.150
我管不了那么多了
I don't care any more

35:42.160 --> 35:44.390
你最好想想你在做些什么
You better start thinking what are you doing?

35:44.400 --> 35:46.290
因为你若死了  就帮不到LJ了
Cos you can't help LJ if you're dead

35:46.300 --> 35:48.220
那边发生什么事了?
What the hell's going on in here?

35:48.230 --> 35:50.290
有麻烦是吗?
Huh? We got a problem?

35:50.300 --> 35:50.590
不是
No

35:50.600 --> 35:52.290
那站起来
Well, then get on your feet

35:52.300 --> 35:54.890

Let's go!

35:54.900 --> 35:56.050

35:58.630 --> 35:59.720
进来
Come in

Fire in the CO break room

36:24.000 --> 36:25.530
谢谢

36:25.540 --> 36:29.040

I didn't do it for you

36:35.770 --> 36:37.230
找到火源
We found the source

36:37.240 --> 36:39.730
有人抽这个吗?
Someone in here smoke these?

36:39.740 --> 36:41.830
"幸运牌" ?
Bilsons?

36:41.840 --> 36:45.540
贝利克

贝利克上尉   有人要见你
Captain Bellick?I've got someone to see you

36:50.600 --> 36:52.260

我知道谁杀了鲍勃  长官
I know who killed Bob, sir

37:01.040 --> 37:04.340

37:21.140 --> 37:24.040
我不知怎么会在那的
I don't know how that got there

37:24.740 --> 37:26.330
不是我的 我们走
It's a mock

37:26.340 --> 37:27.390
不是我的
It's a mock!

37:27.400 --> 37:28.590
你陷害我!
You set me up

37:28.600 --> 37:30.830
你杀狱警已经够坏了
Bad enough that you killed a guard

37:30.840 --> 37:31.990
不要想着
Don't try to lay it off

37:32.000 --> 37:33.490
让别人背这个黑锅
on somebody else

37:33.500 --> 37:34.730
你陷害我
You set me up!

37:34.740 --> 37:38.440
他陷害我的
He set me up...

37:49.840 --> 37:51.690
你父亲在这里住的?
Wow.Your father lived here?

37:51.700 --> 37:53.160
对  他想住在
Yeah  He wanted some place

37:53.170 --> 37:55.160
地图上找不到的地方
that was completely off the grid

37:55.170 --> 37:57.960
一个连政府都不知道的地方
a place the government didn't know existed

37:57.970 --> 37:59.530
偷接过来的电线
Tapped into the power lines

37:59.540 --> 38:01.490
用井供水
A well supplies the place with water

38:01.500 --> 38:05.290
他人生的最后几年 都没有离开过这里
Last few years of his life he barely left the property

38:05.300 --> 38:06.490
真的很...
 It's...

38:06.500 --> 38:07.990
对
Yeah

38:08.000 --> 38:10.060
这么多年来  劳精费神的 对付警察和检察官还有法官
You spend so many years fighting cops, prosecutors, judges

38:10.070 --> 38:11.830
这些人因一些你没有做过的事
trying to take your freedom

38:11.840 --> 38:13.460
要夺走你的自由
for something you didn't do,

38:13.470 --> 38:15.860
而你倾尽所有来打官司
you use every cent you had in attorney's fees

38:15.870 --> 38:19.300
最后一个子儿都没有剩
you wind up losing anyway...

38:19.340 --> 38:23.600
他人生中的15年
15 years of his life

38:23.900 --> 38:28.030
他儿子大部分的童年时光

38:28.040 --> 38:31.590
我想我能原谅他要躲起来
I guess I can forgive him for wanting to hide away

38:31.600 --> 38:33.330
一个人孤独生活
Be left alone

38:33.340 --> 38:35.460
我们住在这里将会很安全
We'll be safe here

38:35.470 --> 38:38.840
直到我们想出下一步怎么做
until we figure out our next move

38:44.770 --> 38:46.560
等一等  等等
Hey, hold up here a minute. Hold up, here

38:46.570 --> 38:48.730
我有点搞不懂了
Seems to be a bit of confusion

38:48.740 --> 38:50.730
我应该弄清楚
I'm supposed to be on this detail

38:50.740 --> 38:53.690
我不这么认为
I don't think so

38:53.700 --> 38:56.190
约翰
Oh, John

38:56.200 --> 38:58.390
你没开玩笑吧?
You can't be serious

38:58.400 --> 39:01.160
我们一起开创
Not after our long, illustrious history

39:01.170 --> 39:02.990
这么辉煌的历史
we shared together

39:03.000 --> 39:07.860
那些在纽约市晚上
All those nights in New York City

39:07.870 --> 39:10.890
在加州
In California

39:10.900 --> 39:12.260
在圣...
In St

39:12.270 --> 39:13.390
路易
Louis

39:13.400 --> 39:14.560
这些时光
They were good times

39:14.570 --> 39:18.070
真是美好  对吗  约翰?
weren't they, John?

39:18.340 --> 39:20.460
我们来告诉狱警这些有多美妙
Tell the badge here about 'em

39:20.470 --> 39:22.430
如果你不想去的话
Cos if you don't want to...

39:22.440 --> 39:26.040
我可以去
I certainly could

39:36.100 --> 39:38.860
给我搞得好好的
I want this place gutted

39:38.870 --> 39:40.560
墙要清理干净

39:40.570 --> 39:42.230
杂物要清掉
Studs gotta be removed

39:42.240 --> 39:43.960
这里有有毒物质
Boss, we've got some toxic issues here

39:43.970 --> 39:45.630
比如石棉
Asbestos to start with

39:45.640 --> 39:47.230
那你向工会投诉去吧
Take it up with the union

39:47.240 --> 39:50.660
我要说的是  这房间是你们要优先执行的任务
All I'm saying is this room's your only priority now

39:50.670 --> 39:52.890
最好给我搞得像新的一样
It better be brand spanking new when you're done

39:52.900 --> 39:55.630
如果有人敢耍小聪明
If anybody's thinking about getting cute

39:55.640 --> 39:57.960
要偷运这些工具出去
trying to trunk one of these tools out of here

39:57.970 --> 40:00.090
贝迪已经记录好
Brady's got the outline

40:00.100 --> 40:01.830
每一件工具的清单
of every piece of hardware in here

40:01.840 --> 40:03.530
而每天工作结束后
And at the end of every day

40:03.540 --> 40:05.190
一件工具都不能少
every single piece better match up

40:05.200 --> 40:08.940
否则你们就死定了
or you're all going to the hole

40:20.170 --> 40:23.640
开工
Let's go

40:29.500 --> 40:31.890
这里下面4英尺
This goes down four feet

40:31.900 --> 40:33.860
连接到主管道
Connects to the main line below

40:33.870 --> 40:35.130
我们要做的是把这口子敲大点
All we've gotta do is widen it

40:35.140 --> 40:36.830
那么我们就有入口了
and we've got ourselves

40:36.840 --> 40:39.470
到66大道的入口
an on-ramp to Route 66.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.460
他们会听到的
Whoa, whoa, whoa.They're gonna hear this, man

40:47.470 --> 40:50.300
不会的
They won't

40:58.540 --> 41:02.700
别这样  宝贝  我们是一伙的了
Come on, pretty. We're a team now

41:11.900 --> 41:13.160
要硬攻了
Best get crackin', eh?

41:13.170 --> 41:15.840
闭嘴 杂毛
You. Shut up

41:33.600 --> 41:35.390
你说你按四下快
You really think you're gonna get to four buttons

41:35.400 --> 41:38.400
还是我按一下快?
before I get to one?

41:56.970 --> 41:59.730
我没戴眼镜
I don't have my glasses

41:59.740 --> 42:02.060
不如你读这个给我听听?
How about you read this for me?

42:02.070 --> 42:05.660
告诉我最新的进展
Tell me the news,the latest developments

42:05.670 --> 42:07.660
很明显  昨天在芝加哥金海岸公寓
Evidently there was an explosion

42:07.670 --> 42:10.230
发生了一起爆炸事故
 in a Gold Coast apartment in Chicago yesterday

42:10.240 --> 42:11.460
煤气管
Gas line

42:11.470 --> 42:13.260
里面的人全死了
Everyone inside was killed

42:13.270 --> 42:15.390
可惜  还有吗?
 Shame Anything else?

42:15.400 --> 42:17.430
橡树公园那个男孩怎样了?
How about that kid up in Oak Park

42:17.440 --> 42:19.230
那个据说杀了双亲的男孩?
the one who killed his parents?

42:19.240 --> 42:21.130
他被抓了 真的吗?
 Oh, they got him  They did?

42:21.140 --> 42:22.360
现在被拘留起来了
He's in custody

42:22.370 --> 42:24.490
好
Good

42:24.500 --> 42:26.990
我想如果不抓他起来 还有更多人受牵连
I imagine heads would have rolled if he hadn't been caught

42:27.000 --> 42:29.990
更多人受害
Lives would have been lost

42:30.000 --> 42:32.590
能把报纸还给我么?
How about you hand that back to me?

42:32.600 --> 42:34.990
既然这是昨天的新闻
Now that it's yesterday's news

42:35.000 --> 42:37.260
我们可以放下了  对吗?
we can put it behind us, can't we?

42:37.270 --> 42:44.060
翻开我们一生中崭新的一章
Move on to the next chapter of our lives

42:44.070 --> 42:46.190
你们这么做  不仅仅是为我
You're not just doing this for me

42:46.200 --> 42:49.640
也不是为了我哥哥
you know.Or my brother

42:50.400 --> 42:53.970
他们在外面等你 副总统女士
They're ready for you, Madam Vice President

42:54.400 --> 42:59.300

You're doing it for your country

43:04.370 --> 43:06.090
