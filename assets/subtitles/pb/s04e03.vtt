00:00.830 --> 00:02.660
《越狱》剧情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

00:02.680 --> 00:05.850
我提供给你的是一个免除15年刑期的机会
I'm giving you an opportunity to avoid 15 years in jail.

00:05.870 --> 00:07.530
-用什么交换  -锡拉
In exchange for? Scylla.

00:07.550 --> 00:09.660
这些是脚踝全球定位跟踪器
These are GPS ankle monitors.

00:09.680 --> 00:10.700
我是你们的头
I'm your boss.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.340
我让你们带上跟踪器
And if I ask you to put on a monitor.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.630
你们就带上跟踪器
You put on a monitor.

00:13.650 --> 00:17.540
惠斯勒的任务是把锡拉交给一名公司高管
Whistler assignment was to drop off Scylla to a Company executive.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.270
他的任务是保护锡拉
And his job was to protect it.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.520
当这一切结束以后  你和我
When this is, when this is all done, you and me.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.960
我们要做个了断
We're gonna settle up.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.040
我找阿历克斯
I'm looking for Alex.

00:25.060 --> 00:27.370
-妈妈  -我们没什么好谈的
-Mom! -We're done talking.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.220
你不能进去
You don't want to go in there.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.880
你不能进去
You don't want to go in there.

00:39.570 --> 00:42.200
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德和林肯·布鲁斯在哪
Where are Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows?

00:42.220 --> 00:45.250
我发誓  我真的不知道他们在哪
I swear to you, I've no idea where they are.

00:45.620 --> 00:46.670
怎么了
What's wrong?

00:46.690 --> 00:48.290
不管它是什么  反正不对
Whatever it is, it ain't it.

00:48.310 --> 00:52.250
假如说锡拉是块披萨  我们得到的只是一片
If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got's a slice.

00:52.450 --> 00:54.610
这么说锡拉不只是一张卡
So Scylla isn't one card.

00:54.630 --> 00:55.960
是六张
It's six.

01:12.010 --> 01:14.240
-你把我们卷进什么之中了  -什么
-What'd you pull us into? -Excuse me?

01:14.260 --> 01:16.010
你以为你把我们骗过来了
You figured you'd get us on the hook.

01:16.030 --> 01:17.670
我们之后就能发现...
So we could find out for ourselves...

01:17.690 --> 01:19.160
整件事有多他妈的麻烦
How screwed this whole thing was!

01:19.180 --> 01:20.920
你到底在说什么
What the hell exactly are you talking about?

01:20.940 --> 01:23.420
数据卡  赛尔夫特工  我说的是卡
The card, Agent Self! I'm talking about the card!

01:23.440 --> 01:24.970
-根本没有用  -等等  等一下
-It's useless! -Wait, wait, hold on.

01:25.130 --> 01:26.460
你已经得到数据卡了
You already got the card?

01:26.480 --> 01:29.080
是的  但没有其余的5张卡  就毫无意义
Yes, but without the other five cards, it means nothing!

01:29.250 --> 01:31.370
而我认为你早就知道
And I can only assume you knew that!

01:31.840 --> 01:33.230
其他五张什么卡
What other five?

01:33.920 --> 01:35.260
别装了
Don't.

01:36.140 --> 01:37.530
其他五张什么卡
What other five?

01:38.910 --> 01:40.530
罗兰下载了卡里的数据
Roland downloaded the card.

01:40.740 --> 01:42.590
卡里没有公司的资料
There's no Company data on the card.

01:42.610 --> 01:45.220
没有其他五张卡  这张就无法读取
So without the other five cards, it's unreadable.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.860
这就像是谜题的6分之1一样
It's like one-sixth of the puzzle.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.240
但这不是我的问题
But that's not my problem.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.150
-因为我们有协议  我们已经...  -不
-Because we had a deal, and we gave you...  -No.

01:50.170 --> 01:52.150
-把你要的东西拿到了  -不  没有  你们没有
-Exactly what you asked for. -No, you didn't! No, you didn't!

01:52.170 --> 01:53.800
我们的协议是你帮我搞到锡拉
We had a deal for you to get me Scylla.

01:53.820 --> 01:55.170
你们没还没搞到  对吧
And you haven't gotten me that, have you?

01:55.190 --> 01:56.280
你向我保证过的
You gave me your word.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.800
我再向你保证一次  如果你们...
And I'm giving you my word again, you will go...

01:57.820 --> 02:01.190
不能把另外5张卡弄到手  就滚回监狱去
Back to prison if you can't get me those other five cards.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.340
但如果你告诉我  你无法做到的话
But if you're telling me you can't get this done.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.840
现在就告诉我  我们会把牢房帮你们准备好的
Just let me know right now, and we'll get your cell ready.

02:07.860 --> 02:08.940
明白吗
You understand？

02:09.820 --> 02:11.020
我会搞定的
I'll get it done.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.500
还有一件事情
There's one more thing.

02:16.620 --> 02:17.530
他怎么说的
So what'd he say?

02:17.550 --> 02:18.680
我们要找到其余的卡
We got to find the other cards.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.060
滚蛋吧  伙计  我们得到卡了  进行第二步吧
Screw that, man. We got the card, let's do the second step.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.500
闯入那一步  结束这一切
The break-in thing, and end all this.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.660
现在那样做没用了
It doesn't work that way now.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.090
这不公平  我们照他说的做了
It's not fair. We did what he said.

02:25.110 --> 02:27.890
那给赛尔夫特工电话  说你想回福克斯河监狱
Then call Agent Self, tell him you want to go back to Fox River.

02:29.010 --> 02:31.920
该死  如果找不到其余的卡  我们都得进监狱
Hell, we're all going to prison if we cannot find the other cards.

02:33.550 --> 02:34.800
当政府感觉事情不妙之后
When the government the gets scared.

02:34.820 --> 02:37.460
他们会先将自己置身度外
They tend to cut the cord.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.380
赛尔夫提过让我们结束任务吗
Did Self talk about shutting us down?

02:39.560 --> 02:42.090
我们还是集中精力找锡拉吧  好吗
Let's just concentrate on finding Scylla, all right?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.370
阿历克斯.
Alex.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.680
他要去哪
Where's he going?

02:51.020 --> 02:52.130
管他呢
Who cares?

02:52.150 --> 02:54.880
我们都不知从哪入手  怎么找锡拉
How are we gonna find Scylla? We don't even know where to start.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.830
你找到的其他东西在哪
Where's the rest of the stuff you found?

02:57.850 --> 02:59.560
还在打印
Still printing it up.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.310
我的东西之前肯定被放在了...
When my device was in Tuxhorn's house...

03:02.330 --> 03:03.940
塔克豪恩家靠近他掌上电脑的地方
It must've been left next to his PDA.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.440
拷贝了里面所有的数据  邮件和照片
Sucked up all the data from it and got e-mails and photos.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.990
有我们需要的信息吗
You see anything we can use?

03:08.010 --> 03:10.800
没有  我跟你们说清楚  我只负责电脑
No, and let me be crystal clear for you guys: I point and click.

03:10.820 --> 03:12.560
仅此而已  其他的事我一概不管
That's it, other than that, I'm off the clock.

03:12.580 --> 03:13.330
闭嘴
Shut up.

03:13.350 --> 03:14.770
等等  他的日程表在哪
Wait a minute, where's his calendar?

03:14.790 --> 03:16.330
在自我感觉良好的医生那
Dr. Feelgood's got it.

03:16.890 --> 03:19.470
在这儿  看看这个
Here, um, take a look at this.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.760
这是今天的日程
This is today's date.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.410
上面除了一颗星之外  什么都没有
There's absolutely nothing on it but a star.

03:22.430 --> 03:24.490
其他日期塔克豪恩都详细写明了...
Every other date, Tuxhorn has details for his...

03:24.510 --> 03:26.720
会面和会议的参与者  时间和地点的信息
Appointments and meetings, who he's with, when and where.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.200
只有今天的日程什么都没写
This is the only thing with nothing on it.

03:28.220 --> 03:29.930
他这么做一定是有原因的
It must be a reason he's keeping that secret.

03:29.950 --> 03:31.860
我们为何不让赛尔夫那家伙做决定
Why are we letting this Self guy call all the shots?

03:31.880 --> 03:33.510
也许我们该强硬一点
Maybe we should play some hardball.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.870
不  要么帮忙  要么滚蛋
No. Either help out or get out.

03:35.890 --> 03:37.360
如果你们要出声...
If you open your mouth...

03:37.380 --> 03:39.840
希望你们会提供建设性的办法
I expect you to offer up a solution.

03:40.460 --> 03:41.930
我不会再说第二遍
I'm not gonna say it again.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.500
-喂  -知道我是谁吗
-Hello? -Do you know who this is?

04:03.720 --> 04:04.900
知道
Yeah.

04:05.090 --> 04:06.640
你被关在哪了
Where are you being held?

04:07.090 --> 04:08.460
我不在监狱
I'm not in prison.

04:08.640 --> 04:09.600
那你在哪
Where are you?

04:09.620 --> 04:10.840
我不能说
I can't say.

04:11.440 --> 04:15.490
我需要你在洛杉矶帮我取点东西
I need you to get something to me in L.A.

04:16.060 --> 04:17.160
阿历克斯
Alex.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.230
不是什么危险的东西  求你了  我...
It's nothing dangerous. Please, I-I...

04:19.390 --> 04:22.840
我不知道我还有多少时间
I don't know how much more time I have here.

04:23.950 --> 04:26.870
听着  别让我做什么...
Look, don't ask me to do something...

04:26.890 --> 04:31.390
你只需要去一趟杜兰哥的住宅中介就行了
You just need to reach out to the residential agency in Durango.

04:32.330 --> 04:34.330
阿历克斯  不行
Alex, no.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.950
你知道他们做了什么吗
Do you know what they did?

04:37.860 --> 04:39.630
他们杀了我的儿子
They killed my son.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.570
他们杀了我的儿子
They killed my boy.

04:49.160 --> 04:52.240
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.310
只要说你愿意帮我
Just say that you'll help me.

04:54.930 --> 04:55.980
求你了
Please?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.610
我需要你的帮助
I just need your help.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.980
我要找到凶手
I need to find out who did it.

05:00.810 --> 05:01.870
求你了
Please.

05:07.160 --> 05:10.270
听着  我知道在福克斯河的时候你要对我保密
So listen, I know in Fox River you had to keep secrets from me.

05:10.290 --> 05:11.880
现在不需要了
You don't now.

05:12.370 --> 05:13.800
怎么了
What's going on?

05:15.720 --> 05:20.160
赛尔夫说我们今天一定要找到下一个持卡者
Self said we have until the end of the day to find the next cardholder.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.730
否则我们全部要回监狱
Or we all go back to prison.

《越狱》第四季 第三集
Prison.Break.S04E03

06:02.120 --> 06:05.060
我知道你保释了斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
I know that you bailed out Scofield and Burrows.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.350
而且我知道他们不在德克萨斯的监狱里
And I know they aren't in a supermax in Texas.

06:08.710 --> 06:11.670
但你知道他们在哪  对吧  布鲁斯
But you know where they are, don't you, Bruce?

06:12.030 --> 06:14.730
你别再找麻烦了
You don't want any more trouble than you're already in.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.930
我不是有麻烦的那个人
I'm not the one in trouble.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.270
让我帮你放松一下
Let me help you relax.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.350
真是美好的一天
It's a beautiful day.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.730
阳光明媚
The sun is shining.

06:43.550 --> 06:46.120
你能感觉到微风拂过吗
Do you feel that gentle breeze?

06:47.540 --> 06:49.600
今天真是个...
It's a great day...

06:50.920 --> 06:53.550
家庭野餐的好日子
For a family picnic.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.640
你不这么认为吗  布鲁斯
Don't you think so, Bruce?

06:59.600 --> 07:00.960
六张卡
Six cards?

07:01.760 --> 07:03.390
当初你可不是这样告诉我的  当
That's not what you sold me, Don.

07:03.410 --> 07:05.480
我知道这超出了我们的预想
I realised it's more than we anticipated.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.980
是超出你的预想
More than you anticipated! .

07:07.000 --> 07:08.710
已经有人问我...
I already have people questioning me...

07:08.730 --> 07:10.770
关于我们编造的重型监狱的事了
About the supermax line we're selling.

07:11.110 --> 07:12.260
整件事就是一个错误
This whole thing was a mistake.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.070
不  这件事没错
No,no, this wasn't a mistake.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.570
斯科菲尔德在24小时内就帮我们得到一张...
Scofield got us a card within 24 hours...

07:16.590 --> 07:17.940
要被送到洛杉矶的卡
Of being dropped in Los Angeles.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.510
他知道自己在做什么
He knows what he's doing.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.300
听着  我愿意冒险  做好我的工作
Look, I'm willing to take the risk and do my job.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.880
我不明白为什么你不能
I don't understand why you aren't.

07:23.900 --> 07:26.710
国土安全部还没确定名称  你还没长毛的时候
I've been in Homeland Security since before it even had a name!

07:26.980 --> 07:29.610
我就在这工作
Since before you even had a single short and curly...

07:29.630 --> 07:32.180
那你就该清楚现在的利害关系  主任
Then you should know what's at stake here, Director.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.800
如果你不下令停止  我们就可以阻止
We could stop it, but not, not if you end this now.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.610
我现在就给达洛参议员挂电话
I'm calling Senator Dallo now.

07:37.630 --> 07:40.730
看看他是否想此事就此结束
I will see if he want shis thing killed or not.

07:42.540 --> 07:44.360
但他是听我的建议的  当
But he follows my recommendations, Don.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.440
先生  已将你到达伦敦的时间...
"Sir, changed your late London arrival...

07:52.460 --> 07:54.710
改为7月16日下午4点
Now 7/16 at 4:00 p.m."

07:54.730 --> 07:55.770
今天是16号
Today's the 16th.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.040
他的日程里没有伦敦  对吧
There's nothing about London in his calendar, is there?

07:58.060 --> 07:59.230
我们看是没有  没有
Not that we've seen, no.

07:59.250 --> 08:02.110
没有任何来回英国的计划
Nothing about travel to or from the UK at all?

08:02.130 --> 08:02.950
没有  什么都没有
No, nothing.

08:02.970 --> 08:05.840
既然他在伦敦没有会面日程...
Now, why would he get an e-mail about an arrival in London...

08:05.860 --> 08:08.470
为何他会收到关于抵达伦敦的邮件呢
When he has no business scheduled there?

08:08.490 --> 08:10.650
可能这封邮件是一个...
It's probably because the e-mail is a...

08:10.950 --> 08:12.180
暗号
Code.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.100
阿历克斯  我很高兴你加入我们
Alex, I'm so glad you joined us.

08:18.120 --> 08:22.110
S-C-Y-L-L-A  锡拉
S-C-Y-L-L-A, Scylla

08:22.130 --> 08:24.050
今天4点的会议室是关于锡拉的
The meeting today at 4:00 is about Scylla.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.620
我们可以假设塔克豪恩不是安排...
I think we can assume that Tuxhorn did not schedule...

08:26.640 --> 08:28.140
自己同自己会面  所以...
A meeting with himself, so that...

08:28.160 --> 08:29.910
会面的地点就是找到下一个持卡者的地方
Is where we're going to find our next cardholder.

08:29.930 --> 08:32.440
好  那么下午4点是时间  还缺地点
Okay, so 4:00 p.m. is our when, we need a where.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.350
如果你需要一个秘密的会面
If you were having a secret meeting.

08:34.370 --> 08:36.180
不会把所有的信息一次都发送
You wouldn't send all the information together.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.320
为了保险  时间和地点的信息会分开发送
You'd send the where and the when separately as a precaution.

08:40.850 --> 08:43.060
还有其他和伦敦的邮件...
Were there any other e-mails sent to Tuxhorn...

08:43.080 --> 08:44.980
同时发给塔克豪恩的吗
At the same time as the London e-mail?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.710
伦敦的邮件发出几秒钟后
Within a few seconds of the London mail.

08:46.730 --> 08:48.750
同一IP地址又发送了两封邮件
Two more e-mails followed from the same IP path.

08:48.770 --> 08:50.700
就在这时  硬盘没有空间了
But that's when my device ran out of hard drive space.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.410
追踪到了IP地址  但没有记录下内容
It picked up the IP address, but not the content.

08:52.430 --> 08:54.800

在我的家乡  有个词叫宿敌
Where I come from, there's something called a blood feud.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.810
他非常想念你
He's missed you very much.

19:26.780 --> 19:29.000
我的父亲已经死了

19:32.650 --> 19:34.150
没错
That's right.

19:36.110 --> 19:37.390
他死了
He is.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.640
你看  布鲁斯
You see that, Bruce?

19:39.660 --> 19:43.930
你刚刚如实回答了我的问题
You just told me the truth in response to something I said.

19:44.670 --> 19:49.530
因为现在撒谎是非常困难的
Because lying is so hard right now.

19:51.230 --> 19:55.350
但说出事实却轻而易举
But telling the truth is so easy.

19:55.370 --> 19:58.350
告诉我真相
So tell me the truth

19:59.330 --> 20:02.610
告诉我参加野餐的人都想知道的事
Tell me what everyone at the picnic wants to know.

20:02.810 --> 20:07.230
告诉我迈克尔·斯科菲尔德和林肯·布伦斯在哪

20:07.480 --> 20:10.010
我  我不  我不知道
I, I don-- I don't know.

20:25.450 --> 20:26.690
布鲁斯
Bruce.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.730
一场大风暴就要来了
A bad storm's coming.

20:33.580 --> 20:37.910
非常猛烈的风暴
A real bad storm.

20:41.710 --> 20:42.940
当·赛尔夫
Don Self.

20:42.960 --> 20:43.990
很好
Good.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.380
议员的确收到我的留言了
So, so the senator did get my message?

20:46.690 --> 20:49.280
不  不  抱歉  明天就太迟了
No, no, I'm sorry, tomorrow's too late.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.810
我现在就要和他讲话
Okay, I-I-I need to speak to him now.

20:52.390 --> 20:54.770
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

20:56.230 --> 20:58.540
赛尔夫特工  该走了
Agent Self, it's time to go.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.750
保罗爷爷比萨点
Pappa Paul's Pizza Palace.

21:14.770 --> 21:15.610
我要一个大号的...
Yeah, I'd like a large...

21:15.630 --> 21:17.840
多加香肠和奶酪的披萨
With extra pepperoni and extra cheese.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.650
诺比特
The Knobbit.

21:22.460 --> 21:24.750
欲女列车
Add Momma To The Train.

21:25.630 --> 21:28.510
业余试镜  第九集

21:28.530 --> 21:30.510
胜者出现了
And we have a winner.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.260
感谢致电伽特公司  有什么可以帮您
Thank you for calling GATE. How may I help you?

22:06.840 --> 22:09.080
第一封邮件是克雷斯迪亚药品的广告
The first e-mail is an ad for Discretia.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.780
壮阳药邮件
An e-mail for pecker pills?

22:11.800 --> 22:13.280
你要电话吗
You want the number?

22:13.300 --> 22:14.610
好极了
That's great.

22:15.330 --> 22:17.680
绝对值得我用命去换
Definitely worth almost losing my life for.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.990
第二封邮件是张邀请...
Second e-mail's an invitation...

22:19.010 --> 22:21.310
加入一个天文观察家的俱乐部的请帖
To join some kind of stargazers' club.

22:21.330 --> 22:24.380
星相能用于定位地球上某个位置
You know, constellations can be used to track points on Earth.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.300
有个网站可以给出...
There is a website launches into the coordinates...

22:27.320 --> 22:29.780
星座图  根据时间日期...
Of star patterns, and depending on the date...

22:29.800 --> 22:32.470
它能找出地球相应的地点
It'll pick a corresponding location on the earth.

22:33.940 --> 22:35.880
你知道这个是因为...
And you know this because...?

22:35.900 --> 22:38.200
因为我儿子和...
Because my son and...

22:39.540 --> 22:43.510
我前妻  我以前会上这个网站
my ex and... and I used to go on this site

22:43.530 --> 22:47.540
这样他们抬头看天  就知道我在哪了
So they could look up at the sky and know where I was.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.330
不是这个  那个星座对应的是南极洲
That's not it, that constellation's over Antarctica.

22:50.350 --> 22:52.510
他不可能从洛杉矶出发  在今天下午...
He's not going to get there today by 4:00 p.m....

22:52.530 --> 22:54.110
4点之前到那
Not from L.A.

22:54.130 --> 22:55.880
那么  我差一点死的毫无价值
So, I almost died for nothing.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.330
-很高兴知道这点  -很多人都死了
-That's good to know. -A lot of people have died.

22:58.350 --> 23:00.080
那是他们的问题  好吗
Well, that's their problem, okay,

23:00.100 --> 23:02.310
因为用命去换这个垃圾的人
Because anyone who gives up their life for this crap.

23:02.330 --> 23:03.340
是傻蛋
Is a sucker.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.340
因为你们根本赢不了
'cause you guys can't win!

23:09.270 --> 23:10.840
再说那些死了的人
Say it about the people who died.

23:11.480 --> 23:12.640
说啊
Say it.

23:12.660 --> 23:14.140
说啊
Say it.

23:16.780 --> 23:18.150
阿历克斯
Alex.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.450
起来
Get up.

23:22.010 --> 23:24.390
回你那呆电脑那  干你的事去
Get back on your nerd box and do your job.

23:31.570 --> 23:34.240
我们可以在湖边找个地方
We can get a little place by the water.

23:34.260 --> 23:37.220
这比你独自亡命天涯好多了
And you'd be better off not being on the run by yourself, either.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.740
我替你保证过的  贝里克
I vouched for you, Bellick.

23:38.990 --> 23:41.640
我跟迈克尔说过  布拉德帮我逃到芝加哥
I told Michael, "Brad I helped me get to Chicago.

23:41.660 --> 23:43.410
他是个好人  相信他
He's a good guy, trust him."

23:43.720 --> 23:44.910
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

23:45.170 --> 23:46.400
现在当我们都有机会...
And now you just want to run...

23:46.420 --> 23:48.240
洗脱罪名的时候  你只想着逃跑
When we have a chance to clear our names?

23:48.260 --> 23:49.840
但这个情形可不乐观
Odds of that don't look so good.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.030
油箱是满的  油门在右边
Tank's full, gas pedal's on the right.

23:52.050 --> 23:53.410
我们可以逃离这里
I say we get the hell out of Dodge

23:53.430 --> 23:55.510
现在  等我们过边境之后再担心...
right now, we can worry about the ankle bracelets...

23:55.530 --> 23:56.310
脚踝跟踪器也不迟
Once we get over the border.

23:56.330 --> 23:57.630
你给我听着
You listen to me.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.140
我现在只关心一件事
There's only one thing I'm thinking about.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.020
她重7磅  眼睛和她妈妈长得一样
She weighs seven pounds, has her mother's eyes.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.110
她的小手心牵挂着我的心
And my heart in the palm of her tiny hands.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.710
所以无论让我找1张卡
Oo if I have to find one card.

24:07.730 --> 24:08.980
或是6张卡
Or six cards.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.260
或是6百万张卡
Or six million cards.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.740
我都会不顾一切的去找
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.510
因为我只抱过我的小乖女儿10秒钟...
'cause I only got to hold my baby girl for ten seconds...

24:14.530 --> 24:16.180
那远远不够
And that wasn't nearly long enough.

24:17.810 --> 24:19.780
你想干什么
What are you doing?

24:19.800 --> 24:20.860
这家伙不会出现了
This guy ain't showing up.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.360
把手举到我们能看到的地方
Hey, get your hands where we can see them!

24:22.380 --> 24:24.540
举起手来  举起手来
Get your hands up! Get your hands up!

24:24.560 --> 24:26.690
-老天  情况不妙  -举起手来
-Oh, my God, this ain't good. -Put your hands up.

24:26.710 --> 24:27.740
我举起来了  我举起来了
I got them up, I got them up!

24:27.760 --> 24:29.220
把手举起来  苏克雷  快点  老兄
Put your hands up, Sucre, come on, man.

24:29.240 --> 24:30.460
-你打给谁?  -等等
-Who you calling? -Hold on.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.620
他们会崩了你的
They're gonna shot you.

24:31.640 --> 24:32.810
快点  把手举起来
Come on, put your hands up!

24:32.830 --> 24:34.710
好了  好了  别开枪  别开枪
Okay, okay, don't shoot, don't shoot.

24:34.730 --> 24:36.010
别开枪  伙计  我们什么都不会做的
Don't shoot, man, we're all right.

24:38.230 --> 24:39.540
电脑挂了
Computer's frozen.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.680
-什么叫挂了  -我不知道
-What do you mean, it's frozen? -I-I don't know.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.520
就是没反应了
It's just not responding.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.050
我都重启两次了  还是不好用
I've rebooted twice now. It's still not letting me on.

24:46.070 --> 24:46.690
再试一下
Try again.

24:46.710 --> 24:48.110
我试了中止路由  强行指令
Look, I've tried a stop route, a jock program.

24:48.130 --> 24:49.630
甚至后门登陆  我是说  你蹲过监狱
Even a back-door entry, I mean, you were in prison.

24:49.650 --> 24:50.720
我肯定你对这个很熟悉
I'm sure you're familiar with that one.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.180
你想死吗
You want to stop breathing?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.280
怎么了
What happened?

24:55.830 --> 24:57.140
他们把我锁死了
They locked me out.

24:57.770 --> 24:59.990
我告诉你  他们要放弃我们了
I'm telling you, they're shutting us down.

25:02.150 --> 25:03.910
我们得走了  他们来了
We gotta go. They're coming after us. Whoa.

25:03.930 --> 25:05.980
我们快走  快点  等等
We gotta go, let's go, come on. Whoa, whoa.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.780
等等  如果我们逃跑  他们会干掉我们的
Wait a minute, we run, they shoot us!

25:07.800 --> 25:09.240
那你留下
Stay.

25:09.260 --> 25:10.660
-莎拉  -什么
-Sara? -Yeah.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.540
我们快离开这里
Let's get out of here.

25:31.910 --> 25:34.080
你说过我们有一天的时间的
You said we'd have until the end of today.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.600
不  这件事已经不受我控制了
No, this goes way over my head.

25:35.620 --> 25:37.170
听着  这个计划已经被终止了
Look, this project's been terminated.

25:37.190 --> 25:39.110
现在停车  结束这一切
Now pull over and end this.

25:39.130 --> 25:40.250
我们能完成任务
We can finish the job.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.240
已经没有任务了  知道吗
There is no more job, okay?

25:42.260 --> 25:44.310
如果这件事曝光  回监狱...
If you make this takedown public, going back to prison.

25:44.340 --> 25:46.240
将是你们最好的结果了
Is going to be the least of your worries.

25:46.690 --> 25:48.210
甩掉他
Lose him.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.710
跟住他  跟住
Stay on him, stay on him.

27:06.870 --> 27:08.620
我们上  我们上
Let's go, let's go!

27:17.110 --> 27:19.180
这边  快
It's this way, go!

27:20.730 --> 27:21.980
快  快  快
Go, go, go!

27:22.220 --> 27:24.390
这里是伽特公司  需要什么帮忙吗

27:24.410 --> 27:26.510
是的  你好  我叫科尔·普发
Yes, hi, my name is Cole Pfeiffer.

27:26.530 --> 27:28.890
我想问问关于始发奖金的事
Uh, I'm calling about my, uh, commencement bonus.

27:28.910 --> 27:30.710
我到现在还没有收到
I haven't received it yet, and, uh...

27:30.730 --> 27:32.310
当然  普发先生
Oh, of course, Mr. Pfeiffer.

27:32.330 --> 27:34.710
不过怀特先生现在不在
Um, Mr. White is out right now,

27:34.730 --> 27:37.410
他肯定是非常不想错过您的电话的
But he's going to be so upset he missed your call.

27:37.430 --> 27:38.740
我试试找一下他
Here, let me try to track him down.

27:38.780 --> 27:40.610
不  不  不用麻烦了
Oh, no, no, don't bother.

27:40.640 --> 27:44.080
你寄张支票给我就行了
Uh, maybe you just could, uh, uh, forward the check to me.

27:44.110 --> 27:46.310
不行  支票都需要怀特先生亲自签发的
No, Mr. White has to sign off on any checks.

27:46.340 --> 27:48.610
而且我知道他非常想和你谈谈
And I know that he really wants to talk to you.

27:48.630 --> 27:49.820
我让他给您回电话
So can I have him reach you...

27:49.840 --> 27:51.570
您看可以吗
At the number that came up on my I.D.?

27:51.590 --> 27:53.300
非常期待
Looking forward to it.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.780
你他妈的为什么要告诉赛尔夫...
Why the hell did you tell Self...

28:13.800 --> 28:15.540
我们今天能找到一个持卡者
That we could get a cardholder by today?

28:15.560 --> 28:16.620
是他这么要求的  阿历克斯
He set the terms, Alex!

28:16.640 --> 28:17.540
我别无选择
I didn't have a choice!

28:17.560 --> 28:18.850
现在我们都没有选择了
And now none of us have a choice.

28:18.870 --> 28:20.910
我绝对不会回监狱
And I am not going back to prison.

28:20.940 --> 28:22.980
我还需要去...
And I still have this that I need...

28:23.010 --> 28:24.540
-绝不回去  -那你跑啊
-Not going back. -Go ahead and run!

28:24.560 --> 28:25.620
伙计们  别吵了
Guys, stop.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.040
脚腕上绑着这东西...
We ain't running anywhere...

28:27.060 --> 28:29.680
我们跑哪都没有用  知道吗
With these things on our ankles, all right?

28:31.810 --> 28:33.280
在那里
It's over here.

28:33.700 --> 28:34.940
这边
It's this way.

28:35.450 --> 28:36.760
等等
Wait a minute.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.320
等等
Wait a second.

28:38.340 --> 28:40.880
信号  信号没了
The signal...the signal's gone.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.710
信号没了
The signal is gone.

28:43.370 --> 28:44.690
他们跑哪去了
Where are they?

28:44.710 --> 28:47.310
我们得找到信号  去找信号
Okay, we gotta go and get the signal, let's get the signal.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.580
我们不能永远呆在这里
We cannot stay here forever.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.510
他们肯定会找到的
They will eventually figure this out.

28:56.530 --> 28:58.900
我不在乎这里能否阻止信号
I don't care if this place blocks the signal or not.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.840
迈克尔  你在干嘛  伙计
Mike, what the hell are you doing, man?

29:00.860 --> 29:01.820
我们没时间了
We don't have time for this.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.460
答案就在这里  肯定在这里
The answers are in here, they have to be.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.970
如果我能找到的话  也许我们还有机会
If I can just find them, we might have a chance.

29:04.990 --> 29:07.480
这是广告  这些都是废话
It's an ad, the words don't make sense.

29:07.510 --> 29:08.850
-都是胡扯  -没错  只有这样...
-It's gibberish. -Exactly, and that's what...

29:08.870 --> 29:10.620
他们才能隐藏信息
Makes them ideal for hiding data.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.150
别管那他妈的什么持卡者了
Forget about the damn cardholder.

29:12.170 --> 29:13.930
赛尔夫已经不需要我们了
Self pulled the plug on us.

29:20.070 --> 29:21.340
你没事吧
Are you okay?

29:23.210 --> 29:25.110
是的  没事
Yeah, yeah.

29:26.110 --> 29:27.710
我们会想出办法的
We're going to figure this out.

29:27.740 --> 29:30.540
我们很擅长在绝境中脱身
We're getting good at pulling off the impossible.

29:30.580 --> 29:32.580
妈的  我不是死而复生了吗  对吧
Hell, I came back from the dead, right?

29:32.600 --> 29:34.310
这是什么
What is it?

29:38.670 --> 29:40.510
你看到什么了
What do you see?

29:46.100 --> 29:48.470
是放在一起看的
They go over each other.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.480
发电厂
Power plant.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.510
新港海滩
New beach.

30:20.740 --> 30:22.410
新港海滩那有座发电厂
There's a power plant in Newport Beach.

30:22.430 --> 30:23.580
那就是会面的地点
That's your meeting.

30:23.730 --> 30:25.580
现在到下午4点时间不多了
We ain't got long until 4:00.

30:25.610 --> 30:27.310
我们怎么才能从这逃出去
How the hell are we going to get out of here?

30:27.330 --> 30:29.290
你能跑多快
How fast can you run?

30:34.880 --> 30:35.830
有信号了吗
Have you got the signal?

30:35.850 --> 30:38.590

Right, because we haven't met yet.

31:21.260 --> 31:23.570

So why don't you come to GATE first thing in the morning?

31:34.830 --> 31:36.570
我想我们可以从...
I think we can all learn something...

31:36.590 --> 31:39.750
东北区的销售冠军那里学到一些东西
From the number one salesman in the entire Northeast Region.

31:39.770 --> 31:43.210
这就是伽特公司教会我们的东西
Weit...it's what GATE teaches.

31:44.100 --> 31:47.050
通过你的知识...
"You can unshackle others...

31:47.070 --> 31:48.700
来帮被束缚的人解脱
With the keys of knowledge."

31:48.720 --> 31:51.430

31:51.450 --> 31:53.290
这就是我知道的  也是我想分享的

31:53.310 --> 31:55.190
瞧  这就是我开这家公司的目的
See, that's why I started this company.

31:55.210 --> 31:58.070
让人们可以摆脱消极的束缚
So that people can avoid "The Captivity of Negativity."

31:58.090 --> 31:59.330
向您致敬  怀特先生
Amen to that, Mr. White.

31:59.350 --> 32:00.640

32:36.330 --> 32:38.140
真是个奇怪的见面地点
Strange place for a meeting.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.700
有些神神秘秘  你不这样觉得吗
A little cloak-and-dagger, don't you think?

32:40.720 --> 32:43.340
一如既往  塔克豪恩  一如既往
Belts and suspenders, Stuart, belts and suspenders.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.510
为什么是老挝
Why Laos?

32:44.850 --> 32:48.520
医生第一次不会去解剖人的尸体
A doctor doesn't perform his first dissection on a human cadaver.

32:48.540 --> 32:50.980
首先从青蛙开始  然后是猪
First, he learns on a frog, then a pig,

32:51.000 --> 32:52.840
然后某天  就是人了
Then one day, a human.

32:53.050 --> 32:54.810
老挝是我们的青蛙
Laos is our frog.

32:54.830 --> 32:57.980
也许丹麦或者乍得会是我们的猪
Perhaps Denmark or Chad will be our pig.

32:58.350 --> 33:02.680
然后  只要我们想  所有东西都是的尸体
After that, anything we want can be our cadaver.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.410
好  我们去检查一下电站的另一面
All right, let's check on the other side of the complex.

举起手来  放在我能看到的地方
Hands up. Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

33:50.970 --> 33:52.630
别跑  站住

Let's see your hands.

33:59.220 --> 34:00.510
把他拷起来
Get him up.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.680
斯科菲尔德跑了
Scofield ran.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.410
不用多久就能抓到他的
Won't take long to find him.

34:06.320 --> 34:07.650
你只是在做无用的拖延
You're just delaying the inevitable.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.190
-不可避免事是锡拉的会面  -闭嘴
-What's inevitable is a meeting with Scylla. -Shut up!

34:10.210 --> 34:11.270
把他押进车子
Put him in the car.

34:11.290 --> 34:13.110
听着  我们看了塔克豪恩的掌上电脑
Listen. We went through Tuxhorn's pda.

They got a meeting on the other side of that building.

34:14.650 --> 34:15.840

It's over, Lincoln, okay?

34:17.160 --> 34:18.250
我知道你希望成功
I know you wanted this to work out.

34:18.270 --> 34:19.520
但现在我已经不能控制了
But it's beyond me now.

34:19.530 --> 34:20.440
好吧  结束了
Okay, it's Done.

34:20.450 --> 34:21.680
我得听从命令  结束了
I have orders. It's over.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.060
还没结束
It's-it's not.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.500
结束了
It's finished!

34:43.270 --> 34:46.270
那么将军  行动到底什么时候开始
So, when exactly does the op-order commence, general?

34:46.290 --> 34:47.620
已经开始了
It already has.

34:47.630 --> 34:49.470
不  我是说  什么时候能得到结果
No. I mean, when do we see ramifications?

34:49.490 --> 34:51.370

I'll tell you what, Stuart.

34:51.670 --> 34:54.670

我来负责行动的事
Let me worry about the op-orders.

35:12.180 --> 35:13.590

36:20.670 --> 36:22.500
我给过你一个很好的开始
I gave you a good enough head start.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.720
你应该好好利用
Should have took advantage of it.

36:25.130 --> 36:27.180
是啊  但那样我就无法给你这个了
Yeah, but then I wouldn't have been able to give you this.

36:27.190 --> 36:28.930
看录像吧
Press the video function.

36:29.810 --> 36:30.920

It was a meeting between all six cardholders.

36:36.220 --> 36:38.640
现在我们知道谁拥有其他5张卡了
So now we know who has the other five cards.

36:38.660 --> 36:39.980
这该有所意义吧
And that should mean something.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.370
即使对一个毫无话语权的人也是吧
Even to someone whose word means nothing.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.380
我现在要给达洛参议员挂电话
I'm gonna call senator Dallo now.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.860
但他听我的建议  当
But he follows my recommendations, Don.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.380
下次你再逃跑的话
The next Time you run from me.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.440
我不会再开车追你
I'm not gonna be chasing you down in a car.

他们检查他的脚踝了吗  因为他一定...
They check his wrists? 'Cause he must...

38:26.780 --> 38:28.310
别管他的事
Let him be.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.780
不服从上级的命令  是吧
Insubordination's tiring, huh?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.380
你何时学会直接给达洛参议员打电话了
Where the hell do you get off calling Senator Dallo directly?

39:09.770 --> 39:11.110
你不能到我的地盘
You don't move into my city.

39:11.130 --> 39:13.280
到我的办公室  就把我踩在脚下
Into my regional office and go over my head!

39:13.300 --> 39:14.750
你要我怎么做
What do you want from me?

39:15.320 --> 39:17.040
你知道游戏规则的  赫博
You know how it works, Herb.

39:17.330 --> 39:19.680
你以为公司要杀你的时候
You think when the Company's breathing down your neck.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.310
达洛参议员会出面救你吗
Senator Dallo's gonna bring in the cavalry?

39:22.330 --> 39:24.880
他会假装从来不认识你
He'll pretend he's never even heard of you.

39:25.090 --> 39:27.040
现在你只能靠自己了  赛尔夫
You're on your own from now on, Self.

39:27.060 --> 39:27.860
你要孤军奋战了
You're an island.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.410

If I'm an island, what are you doing here?

39:31.190 --> 39:33.980
出去  让我把我的活干完
Get out of my office and let me finish what I started.

39:35.890 --> 39:37.840

41:59.340 --> 42:01.340
逼我出来

42:04.540 --> 42:06.980
他们让我的前妻...
And then they let my ex-wife...

42:07.740 --> 42:09.050

42:12.670 --> 42:14.840
为了让她亲口告诉我  如果我不出现...
Just so she could tell me that she was next...

42:15.770 --> 42:17.840
他们就杀了她
If I didn't turn myself in.

42:17.980 --> 42:19.690
现在他们把她藏起来
Now she's in protective custody,

42:19.710 --> 42:21.640

And I'm living in a warehouse trying to find...

42:21.660 --> 42:24.190
