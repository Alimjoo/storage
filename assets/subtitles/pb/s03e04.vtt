00:23.050 --> 00:25.140
-你找到我的书了吗? -找到了
-Were you able to find my book? -Yeah.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.840
但有个家伙出现
But there was this guy.

00:26.850 --> 00:28.150
把书抢走了
He took it.

00:28.150 --> 00:28.840
他让我告诉你
He said to tell you

00:28.850 --> 00:30.840
斯科菲尔德的哥哥拿了那本书
that Scofield's brother has it now.

00:30.850 --> 00:32.140
你得把他们救出来
You have to break them out of there.

别再尝试这么做
You're never going to try anything like that again.

00:39.150 --> 00:40.040
只是为了确认
But just to make sure,

00:40.050 --> 00:42.250
我在车库里给你留了点东西
I left you a little something in the garage.

01:37.950 --> 01:40.650
窗外有什么比自由更吸引人的东西么?
What's so interesting out there, other than our freedom?

01:40.650 --> 01:43.950
出逃者还活着 证明围墙上没电
Finds are alive, so the fence is dead

01:43.950 --> 01:46.140
是么?这里每个人都知道那围墙没用
Yeah? Everyone in here knows is that fence doesn't work,

01:46.150 --> 01:47.140
但这也改变不了什么
and it doesn't mean a bloody thing,

01:47.150 --> 01:48.340
因为外面有士兵把守
because there are soldiers out there

01:48.350 --> 01:50.240
只要你在30码内他们就会把你射死
that'll shoot you dead before you get within 30 yards of it.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.750
我得好好计划一下了 不是么?
Well, I guess I got a lot of work to do, don't I?

01:53.650 --> 01:54.940
听着 老兄 我知道你抢了我的书
Listen, mate, I get what you're doing with my book.

01:54.950 --> 01:57.340
他们抓走了你的女友 而你抢走了他们要的东西
They hold your girlfriend, you hold what they want.

互惠互利 Churchill 101法案
Countering needs. Churchill 101.

马上那些杂种就要来问我
Soon those bastards are going to ask me

02:00.550 --> 02:02.240
他们所要的 我了解了多少
what progress I've made in figuring out what they want,

02:02.250 --> 02:05.550
我就要说完全不了解 因为林肯·布鲁斯把书抢走了
and I'm going to say nil, 'cause Lincoln Burrows has the book.

02:05.650 --> 02:06.750
知道么?
You know what?

02:08.150 --> 02:08.740
威胁
Threatening the brother

02:08.750 --> 02:10.040
要帮你越狱的人的哥哥
of the guy who's supposed to get you out of here

02:10.050 --> 02:11.240
并不是个好主意
might not be the smartest move.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.350
我没有威胁你 我们在同一条船上
I'm not threatening we're on the same team.

02:13.450 --> 02:14.640
但如果我们因为那本书纠缠不清
But if we play games with that book,

02:14.650 --> 02:17.950
那些想让我出去的人会采取行动的
people who want me out of here will take action

02:18.250 --> 02:20.950
"我不在乎你们做什么 就怕你们什么也不做"
"I never worry about action, only inaction."

02:21.350 --> 02:22.840
根据Churchill 101法案
Churchill 101.

02:22.850 --> 02:25.650
如我所说 现在我有很多事要做
Now, like I said, I got a lot of work to do.

02:56.150 --> 02:57.650
林肯 你还好吧?
Linc, you all right?

02:58.750 --> 02:59.540
对不起 老弟
I'm sorry, man.

02:59.550 --> 03:02.340
都是那东西 它快找到我了
Just all this stuff it's starting to get to me.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.350
知道么?
You know?

03:06.750 --> 03:09.640
听着 我们的境遇很快会改变
Listen, our situation could change very, very soon.

03:09.650 --> 03:11.450
那个监狱掘墓人
The grave digger for the prison.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.440
你得和他联系上
I need you to reach out to him.

03:13.450 --> 03:14.640
告诉他什么?
And tell him what?

03:14.650 --> 03:15.840
都写在上面了
It's all written down.

03:15.850 --> 03:17.450
我们现在就得采取行动
But we got to get started now.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.950
你有什么没告诉我的?
What are you not telling me?

03:23.750 --> 03:24.240
所有人
All these people

03:24.250 --> 03:25.850
都因为我而受伤害
that have been hurt because of me.

03:26.650 --> 03:30.940
我很抱歉 迈克
I'm so sorry, Michael.

03:30.950 --> 03:33.050
这是他们造成的 不是你
They did this, not you.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.150
好吗?
Okay?

03:34.650 --> 03:35.950
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.250
找到那个掘墓人
Just get to the grave digger.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.250
我感觉我们没多少时间了
I feel like we're running out of time.

这场较量中我只是一个棋子 林肯
I am just a soldier in this war, Lincoln,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.200
和你一样
just like you.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.500
我并不想那么做的
I did not want to do that.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.190
你能理解
Can you even comprehend the intimacy

05:36.200 --> 05:38.900
我对那个女人下手时的感受吗?
of the mechanics of what I had to do to that woman?

05:39.600 --> 05:41.100
那太恐怖了
It's horrible

05:42.500 --> 05:44.700
现在 如果你和你弟弟停止耍花招
Now, if you and your brother are done playing games,

05:44.800 --> 05:46.300
LJ会没事的
LJ will be fine.

05:46.400 --> 05:50.390
我最不想做的事是把他一块块寄给你
If not, the last thing I want to do send millions pieces of him to you

05:50.400 --> 05:52.290
但如果你逼我
But if you push me

05:52.300 --> 05:55.900
即使没逼那么狠 我会这么做的
and not even that far, I will.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.200
你叫我干什么我就干什么
I'll do anything you want.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.700
别伤害我的儿子就好
Just don't hurt my son.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.600
这些都取决于你
That's really up to you.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.290
我知道这几天很难熬
I know the past few days have been hard,

06:07.300 --> 06:08.600
我也一样
for me, as well.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.900
如果你想聊聊
If you want to talk about it,

06:11.200 --> 06:13.100
我理解这痛苦的感觉
I know what this pain feels like.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.790
我只想把那个人搞出Sona
I just want to get your boy out of Sona

06:14.800 --> 06:16.400
然后接回我儿子
and get my son back.

06:17.700 --> 06:18.900
迈克有计划了
Michael's got a plan.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.100
我需要细节
I need details.

06:20.300 --> 06:20.990
我们得把某个
We need to bring someone

06:21.000 --> 06:23.100
在监狱工作的人拉拢过来
who works at the prison onto the team.

06:23.100 --> 06:23.900
谁?
Who?

06:24.300 --> 06:25.600
掘墓人
The grave digger.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.300
去做吧
Get it done.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.800
林肯 我需要那本书
Lincoln, I'm going to need that book.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.600
中情局把你给我的那本做了笔迹鉴定
The Company did handwriting analysis on the one you gave me,

06:36.200 --> 06:38.300
你的字迹从高中以来就没变过
and yours hasn't changed since high school.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.000
我们只是棋子 林肯
Just soldiers, Linc.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.800
代表不同方 但本质是一样的
Different armies, but soldiers just the same.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.200
打得好
Nice.

我在学校里是最棒的
I was the best in my school.

去你的
Kiss my ass,

07:16.900 --> 07:17.900

07:21.700 --> 07:23.000

根据风向调整
Adjust for wind.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.000
闭嘴
Shut up.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.200
向外偏一点就好了
Just a bit outside.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.900
老兄 你知道我现在没有钱
Hey, bro, you know I don't have that kind of verde lying around.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.900
需要点时间
It's going to take a while.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
问题在于 我没有时间了
Well, the thing is, I don't have a while.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.400
-所以 除非 -别 别再拉拢我了
-So, unless -No, no more favors.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.290
好吧
All right.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.890
我能借你的十字架一用么?
Can I borrow that cross of yours?

07:45.900 --> 07:49.500

07:50.000 --> 07:51.490
还有 那甚至不是金的
Besides, it's not even real gold.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.600
这正是我需要它的原因
That's why I need it.

07:53.900 --> 07:54.690
听着 我会还给你的 好吗?
Look, I'll give it back, okay?

07:54.700 --> 07:56.000
只是借
It's just a loan.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.900
给我吧

08:08.200 --> 08:10.000

08:21.300 --> 08:22.700
又是灯

09:35.500 --> 09:35.890
听好了
Listen,

09:35.900 --> 09:40.500

I've been thinking about and, uh, you're in.

09:41.800 --> 09:42.490
我算入伙了
I'm in.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.790
好吧
Okay.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.800
-就这么简单? -是的
-Just like that? -Right.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.600
我别无选择 不是吗?
I really don't have a choice, do I?

09:48.800 --> 09:49.590
你怎么计划的?
What's the plan?

09:49.600 --> 09:50.700
我正在想办法
I'm working on it.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.390
与此同时 你也可以帮上我的忙
Meanwhile, I could use your help.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.200
你需要什么?
What do you need?

09:54.300 --> 09:55.800
黑色毡尖笔
A black felt-tipped pen.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.490
-一支钢笔? -没错

09:57.500 --> 09:58.590
-为什么? -有些文件

09:58.600 --> 10:00.300

我要你跟我们步调一致
I need you to get your act together.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.190
我需要你控制好自己
I need you to bring yourself

10:10.200 --> 10:12.590
因为你那样很夺人眼球
under control, because you're attracting attention,

10:12.600 --> 10:14.700
而那是我们不想看到的
and that we don't need.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.200
我能控制好自己
I'm under control.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.800
你当然可以
Of course you are.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.700
这就是用电负荷过大的下场
This is what happens when a system is overloaded.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.400
看到吗?
See? Look.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.600

我只是个卡车司机
I'm a truck driver.

10:46.900 --> 10:47.900

-你在这过得怎样 -非常好
-you're holding up in here. -Just dandy.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.690
我也经历过段受煎熬的日子
Yeah, well, I've been having a tough time of it myself.

10:56.700 --> 10:57.790
但我想我们的命不该这样
And I was figuring shouldn't be that way

10:57.800 --> 10:59.690
我们可是唯一的正直人士
for us, seeing as how we're the only lawmen here

10:59.700 --> 11:00.800
在这个阴曹地府里
in Taco Hell.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.990
嘿 等会儿 阿历克斯
Hey, whoa, hang on a second there, Alex.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.290
你和我 我们可是一队的
You and me we were a team

11:04.300 --> 11:05.190
还记得我们在外面的时候吗?
on the outside, remember?

11:05.200 --> 11:07.890
我是你的部下 现在依然对你忠心不二
I was your dog, and I still got a lot of bark left in me.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.090
布拉德 我很忙 你到底想怎样?
I'm busy, Brad. What do you want?

11:10.100 --> 11:12.490
你和斯科菲尔德在计划逃跑是吧?
You and Scofield you're up to something, right?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
你可以告诉我 兄弟之间没有隔阂
You can tell me, one badge to another.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.500
我能帮上忙
I can help.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.800
你有黑色毡尖笔吗?
Do you have a black felt-tipped pen?

11:18.800 --> 11:19.990
我没有
Not on me.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.500
那你帮不了我
Then you can't help me.

11:39.900 --> 11:40.900
我都知道了
I know.

11:42.100 --> 11:42.590
你知道什么了?
You know what?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.390
我知道你在计划越狱
I know you're trying to escape from here

11:44.400 --> 11:46.200
和那个叫斯科菲尔德的家伙
with that man, Scofield.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.600
-宝贝 -求你不要欺瞒我
Sweetheart Please, don't lie to me.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.800
林肯·布鲁斯把一切都告诉了我
Lincoln Burrows, he told me everything.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.390
有些非常有权势的人希望我出来
There are some very powerful people that want me out of here.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.990
-他们让那哥俩救我出去 -为何?
And they want those brothers to get me out. Why?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.300
我也不确定
I'm not sure.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.100
应该和我在西雅图看到的场景有关系
Has something to do with a charter I did in Seattle.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.190
我只知道他们的最终目的
What I do know is their end game

12:05.200 --> 12:08.000
和我们的一样 就是让我逃出这鬼地方
is exa the same as ours, and that's me out of this hellhole.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.490
一旦成功了
And once that happens,

12:09.500 --> 12:12.200
你和我就会消失 永远销声匿迹
you and I will disappear forever.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.290
但是我不想让你趟这趟浑水
But I don't want to involve you in this mess.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.090
我想帮你啊
I want to help.

12:15.100 --> 12:15.990
那太危险了
That's way too dangerous.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.390
詹姆斯我不是在请求你的批准
I'm not asking your permission, James.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.700
我是在告诉你
I'm telling you.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.490
我自己一人也能搞定
I can do this on my own,

12:20.500 --> 12:21.890
或者你可以把你知道的告诉我
or you can tell me what you know

12:21.900 --> 12:23.600
然后我们共同解决
and we can work it through together.

12:25.900 --> 12:28.200
我对发生的事情也不明白
I don't understand everything that's going on,

12:28.300 --> 12:29.390
但是那对兄弟 他们显然试图
but these brothers, they're obviously trying

12:29.400 --> 12:30.990
从我身上打探出信息来
to find out what they can about me.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.890
我们看看能从他们身上了解多少
Let's see what we can discover about them.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.790
弄清楚他们的计划 了解真实目的
Find out what their plan is, see what they're all about.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.090
他们帮你越狱 你却不信他们?
They're trying to get you out, and you don't trust them?

12:37.100 --> 12:39.000
我谁都不信任
I don't trust any of these guys.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.500
你也不该相信
And yoshouldn't, either.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.690
如果你坚持要跟此事
If you insist on getting into this,

12:42.700 --> 12:44.700
向我保证你会加倍小心
promise me you'll be careful.

12:44.900 --> 12:45.990
因为如果你出什么三长两短
Because God knows I will die

12:46.000 --> 12:47.700
我也不会苟活的
if anything happens to you.

12:51.000 --> 12:51.800
嘿

13:11.100 --> 13:12.100
迈克
Michael.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.100

Here.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.500
我说过我要的是黑色毡尖笔
I said I need a black felt-tipped pen.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.700
那是黑色的
That's black.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.000
这不是我需要的
It's not what I need.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.500
继续去找
Keep looking.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.400
他在耍你
He's playing you.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.000
他在耍你
He's playing you.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.100
不要相信他
Do not trust him.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.900
你那美国佬兄弟
Your amigo, the American.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.100
他是建筑工程师 是吗?
He's a builder, an engineer, no?

13:59.100 --> 14:01.000
老大 他可不是我的朋友
He's no amigo of mine, boss.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.790
相信我 你绝不希望
And trust me, you do not want

14:02.800 --> 14:03.690
和他扯上关系
to get under the covers with that

14:03.700 --> 14:05.500
回答我 是或不是工程师?
Is he or is he not an engineer?

14:05.600 --> 14:07.000
好吧 是的 但是
Well, yeah, but

14:10.800 --> 14:11.900
斯科菲尔德
Scofield.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.000
什么事?
Yeah?

14:14.400 --> 14:15.890
你懂电路吗?
What do you know about the electricity?

14:15.900 --> 14:17.800
停电时候就会懂吧
Only that we don't have any right now.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.700
和你说件事情
Let me tell you something.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.090
这部手机能让食物运进来
This phone keeps all the food coming to the gate.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.190
这样才能保障Sona监狱的正常运转
It keeps my business running, it keeps Sona running.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.290
断电了 电话也就不能用了
Electricity die, phone die.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.300
-电话没了我们也完蛋 -我们完蛋 你也完蛋
Phone die, we die. We die or youdie?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.090
小子 你知识够丰富
Boy, you have enough

14:31.100 --> 14:32.890
但是人不够聪明
education, but you're not being smart.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.790
我来找你 是给你机会
Now, I come to you, that is an opportunity.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.590
放聪明些 好好把握机会
Be wise and take advantage.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.200
现在回答我 能修复电路吗
Now, can you fix the electricity

14:40.200 --> 14:41.690
就像你搞定水源那样
just like you fixed the water?

14:41.700 --> 14:42.990
这可没有那么简单
It's not that simple.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.990
水管是在监狱里的
The water pipes are inside the prison.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.590
电线却可能是在地底
The electrical lines are probably running underground

14:47.600 --> 14:49.490
沿着墙外排布的
along an exterior wall,

14:49.500 --> 14:51.100
意味着电线在外面的
which means they're out there somewhere

14:51.900 --> 14:53.200
某个禁入区
in no-man's-land.

14:53.900 --> 14:56.290
那你能恢复电力吗?
So, you can fix the power?

14:56.300 --> 14:58.190
上次我看到他们射杀了出去的人
Last I checked, they shoot prisoners who go out there.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.900
所以我觉得答案是"不行"
So I'm thinking the answer is"no."

15:02.300 --> 15:03.800
听我说
You listen to me,

15:04.100 --> 15:06.200
听清楚了 小子
and you listen closely, water boy.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.400
不管情况是否相似 不管有没有士兵
Like it or not, soldiers or not,

15:08.900 --> 15:11.700
你要去禁入区
you're going out into no-man's-land.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.500
这是自杀式任务
It's a suicide mission.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.590
我要打几个电话
I'll make some calls.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.000
-你要确保我安全 -尽我所能吧
And you're going to keep meafe? As best I can.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.190
我觉得我做不到
I don't think I can do this.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.400
不 不 不 你会帮我的
No, no, no, no, no. You will help me with this.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.790
我也会为你做点事情的
Look, I will do something for you.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.290
我会给你一个新枕头
I'll get you a new pillow,

15:31.300 --> 15:33.500
鹅毛的 像我的那样 或者一台小电视
goose-feather like mine, or a small TV.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
好吧
All right.

15:36.700 --> 15:37.800
给我那间房间
Get me that.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.890
-为什么? -这里可以享受早上第一缕阳光
Why? It's the first one to get sunlight in the morning.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.900
你给我那间囚室 我给你电力
You get me that cell, I'll get you electricity.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.600
好啊林肯
Hey, Linc.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.300
兄弟 我很快就要离开你了
Look, bro, um, I'm going to be out of your way real soon.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.390
我看到哥伦比亚招移民工人的小广告
I saw these flyers for migrant workers in Colombia.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.290
现在是咖啡豆的收获季节
It's coffee bean season,

16:18.300 --> 16:19.890
他们让巴拿马人去干活
and they're letting Panamanians in,

16:19.900 --> 16:23.000
所以我想 换张身份证我就可以过关了
so I figure, with a good ID, I can pass.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.300
大巴今天发车 好吗?
Bus leaves today, okay?

16:25.400 --> 16:28.790

16:32.000 --> 16:34.090
林肯我很欣赏你做的每件事
Linc, uh I appreciate everything you've done

16:34.100 --> 16:34.990
只需要几个小时
It'll just be a couple hours.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.400
几个小时就够了
Just a couple hours, that's it.

16:37.300 --> 16:40.090
我15岁时 我堂兄给了我一份工作

16:40.100 --> 16:43.090
只消几小时 我却在少教所待了三个月

16:43.100 --> 16:44.190

I can't do this without you.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.790

I'm in Panama, I don't speak the language

16:45.800 --> 16:47.590
可是我也不能错过大巴

他知道我们不是在讨论车子
He knows we're not talking about cars.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.100

21:17.800 --> 21:19.090

所谓"公司"的人想让你进来这儿
Somebody called"the Company"wanted you in here

21:28.200 --> 21:30.090
看来你知道的并不多
Doesn't sound like you know much after all.

21:30.100 --> 21:30.790
我不需要知道
I don't need to know

21:30.800 --> 21:31.890
臭气熏天的时候
how to change a diaper

21:31.900 --> 21:34.200
要怎么换尿布
to know when it stinks to high hell.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.990
你是有目的的 斯科菲尔德
You're doing something here, Scofield.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000

22:06.700 --> 22:09.300

你介意告诉我 他怎么会在这里吗
You mind telling me why he's even out here with us?

23:01.600 --> 23:03.500
他猜到点什么
He knows something's up.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.190
该死的 他怎么会知道的
How the hell does he know that?

23:05.200 --> 23:07.000
只能说 我还是有点名气的
Let's just say I have a bit of a rep.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.800
因为福克斯河的事情?
From Fox River?

23:12.700 --> 23:14.300
我知道你是谁 伙计
I know who you are, mate.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.200

23:16.600 --> 23:18.290
终于明白为什么他们会把你送进来
Finally made sense why they pick you

23:18.300 --> 23:19.800
而不是其他人
of all people to send here.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.800
别担心
No worries.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.100
保管你的小秘密 对我有好处
It's in my interest to keep your little secret.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.190
但是贝利克?
But Bellick?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.900
不能相信他
Can't be trusted.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.790
我可以搞定贝利克
I can handle Bellick.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.500
他不在计划内
He's not in on this.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.690
好 好吧
Okay, good.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.100
但是马宏在
But Mahone is.

23:36.700 --> 23:37.900
马宏?
Mahone?

23:38.400 --> 23:40.090
他像个病猫似的
He's looking abouts stable as a three-legged chair,

23:40.100 --> 23:41.290
他要跟我们一起越狱?
and he's escaping with us?

23:41.300 --> 23:43.300
不 只是他自己那么以为
No, he just thinks he is.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.990
他需要镇静剂
He needs his meds.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.690
否则他会疯掉
Without them, he'll self destruct.

23:47.700 --> 23:49.500
只是时间问题
It's just a matter of time.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.700
要是他没疯呢
And if he doesn't?

23:52.800 --> 23:55.500
我会骗他 告诉他他想知道的
I'll string him along, tell him what he wants to hear,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.700
然后摆脱他
and then I'll cut him loose.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.800
我怎么知道你不会对我做同样的事?
How do I know you're not going to do the same thing to me?

24:02.100 --> 24:03.500
你不用知道
You don't.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.500
需要帮助吗 我的朋友
You need a hook-up, my friend?

24:24.200 --> 24:24.590
不用了
No.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.090
别着急
Take your time.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.600
我可不强买强卖
I don't hard sell.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.890
我的货品不会让你后悔的
My pduct speaks for itself.

24:29.900 --> 24:33.490
在外面 我使用一些药品
Outside, I took something.

24:33.500 --> 24:38.290
一些需要医师处方才可买到的药 叫Varatril
It's a prescription drug called Varatril,

24:38.300 --> 24:40.700
我在想 你是不是可以
and I was wondering if you

24:41.300 --> 24:42.890
这里可没药房
This ain't no farmacia.

24:42.900 --> 24:45.500
但是我这有
But what I got right here

24:45.700 --> 24:47.090
比所有美国医生给你的东西
it's bter than anything your doctor

24:47.100 --> 24:48.800
还要好
gave you back in the States.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.190
那是焦油
That's tar.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.090
来尝尝 就一点
Just take a taste, algo pequenito.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.300
你知道的 要有约束
You know, keep it in check.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.300
我现在没钱
I don't have any money right now.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.990
那我也没药
Then I don't have any drugs.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.690
但是对个男人来说 在索纳
But there are a few ways for a man

25:02.700 --> 25:04.090
还是有些办法可以赚点小钱的
to make a few dollars in Sona

25:04.100 --> 25:05.690
满足其他人的需要
servicing the needs of others

25:05.700 --> 25:06.690
我个人是不感兴趣
not something I'm into

25:06.700 --> 25:08.300
你觉得我是个废物?
You think I'm a punk?

25:12.100 --> 25:12.890
我只是在帮你
I'm just helping you

25:12.900 --> 25:15.800
好起来 朋友 只是帮你好起来
get well, friend, just helping you get well.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.500
勒齐先生
Ser Lechero?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.500
勒齐先生
Ser Lechero.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.390
你想要什么
What do you want?

25:30.400 --> 25:32.290
我知道你是大忙人 但我想告诉你
Look, I know you're a busy man, but I wanted to tell ya,

25:32.300 --> 25:33.390
我不知道迈克·斯科菲尔德到底在干什么
I don't know exactly what he's doing,

25:33.400 --> 25:36.600
-但他只是拿你做垫脚石 -不是的 猪
but Michael Scofield's taking you for a ride. No, cerdo,

25:36.600 --> 25:37.590
我不那么认为
I don't think so.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.190
听着 昨天我听他说关于越狱的事
Listen, I heard him talking about escape yesterday

25:40.200 --> 25:42.490
-关于逃离这里 -他说要越狱
about breaking outta here. It's he's talking about escape,

25:42.500 --> 25:45.000
为什么你跑来告诉我 而不是跟他一起
why are you here telling me and you're not going with him, eh?

25:47.300 --> 25:49.490
如果他肯我当然愿意 但是他已拒绝我了
I would if he'd let me, but he's already cut me out.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.490
他说他没事 但是我知道
He says he's square, but I know

25:50.500 --> 25:52.290
那个狗娘养的在计划点什么
the son of a bitch is up to something.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.390
所以我想
So I figured,

25:53.400 --> 25:54.790
如果我不能逃跑 我也许该告诉你
if I ain't running, I might asl tell you

25:54.800 --> 25:56.290
然后我在这的日子会好过点
and make my time in here a little bit easier.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.990
每个人都幻想逃出索纳监狱
Every man fantasizes about escaping from Sona.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.890
对 但不是每个人都可以在禁入区用铁铲铲地
Yeah, but they aren't all in no-man's-land with shovels.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.990
铁铲是我给他的 轰他出去
I'm gave him the shovels. Get him out.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.790
我和你一样 也给过他铁铲 还有帮手
I gave him shovels too, and guys to work with, just like you.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.100
我在他越狱的监狱工作
I worked in the prison he broke out of.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.990
他说他是在帮我忙
He said he was doing me a favor

26:14.000 --> 26:16.590
修理火灾引起的破坏 他点的火
fixing damage from a fire he started.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.790
而你知道我得到什么了吗
And you know what I got?

26:17.800 --> 26:20.600
四肢被捆 被丢在我自己监狱的下水道里
Hog-tied and left in a pipe under my own prison.

26:23.300 --> 26:24.700
他做不了什么的
There's nothing he can do.

26:25.800 --> 26:26.890
有士兵看着呢
The soldiers are watching him.

26:26.900 --> 26:27.490
我也曾那么想
That's what I thought,

26:27.500 --> 26:29.800
直到他挖地道到我的保卫室
until he tunneled out ofy guard's room.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.490
我在外面的接线盒里埋了些东西
He's buried something in a junction box out there

26:32.500 --> 26:34.190
然后用土盖住 我都看见了
and covered it with dirt I saw him.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.790
你可以亲自去看
Go see for yourself.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.800
我要是骗你就不得好死
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.200
你在索纳总是不顺心 是吧?
Trouble keeps finding you here in Sona, doesn't it?

26:45.600 --> 26:47.400
我们来散散步吧
Let's take a walk, eh?

26:54.200 --> 26:56.090
有传言说你在耍我
There are rumors about that you are trying to trick me.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.490
你让我做什么我就做什么
I'm just doing what I'm told.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.490
为了你的小命着想 最好那是真话
Oh? Let's hope for your sake that's true.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.490
嗯?
Hmm?

27:01.500 --> 27:03.100
为了确认一下
But justmake sure,

27:03.400 --> 27:05.600
我们去禁入区吧
let's go on out to no-man's-land

27:05.800 --> 27:07.600
看看你埋了什么
and see what you buried there.

27:19.800 --> 27:20.490
只是想要确认下
Just want to make sure

27:20.500 --> 27:22.790
我的人是否在为长官认真工作
my men are doing a good job for the colonel.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.200
过去
Get in there.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.000
过去
Get in there.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.700
打开它
Open it.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.890
把土扒开
Move the dirt.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.100
现在就做
Now

27:51.000 --> 27:52.090
这是传输管胶带
It's duct tape.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.390
修补磨损的电线
To fix the frayed wires.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.900
这就是为什么电力这么不稳定的原因
That's why the power was so inconsistent.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.800
我不想这些胶带松掉
I didn't want the tape to come loose,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.500
所以用土盖住
so I packed it down with dirt.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.100
棒极了
Beautiful.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.000
你要去哪
Where are you going?

28:10.200 --> 28:12.490
我得去把主开关打开
I got to turn the main power switch back on.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.500
我把它关掉了 因而我们能安全工作
I had to turn it off, so we could work on the wires safely.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.790
我要跟你一起
I'll come with you.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.990
只是去拉一下开关
It's just a switch.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.490
我可以自己来
I can handle it myself.

28:19.500 --> 28:22.200
你是可以 但是你不能这么做
You can but you won't.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.300
送水的小子 在这里呢
Hey, water boy, it's back here.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.090
我不需要项链 只这个十字架
I don't need the chain, just the cross.

28:41.100 --> 28:43.090
它的大小适合 而且不是真金
It's the perfect size and it's not real gold,

28:43.100 --> 28:45.100
所以我不会触电
so it won't conduct current.

28:48.500 --> 28:49.490
电路一直循环
Keep the circuit open

28:49.500 --> 28:51.290
即使总开关打开了
no power even when the main switch

28:51.300 --> 28:52.190
也没有电
is turned on.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.200
把十字架拿出来
Take the cross out

28:55.200 --> 28:57.000
索纳的灯又亮了
Sona lights up again.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.790
如果勒齐知道你们在电上搞鬼
Lechero find out you messed with his electric

28:59.800 --> 29:00.890
你就死定了
you're dead.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.200
他永远不会发现的
That's why he can't ever find out.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.800
现在 别想让我接应你
Now, don't make me come get you.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.900
这里没有人能帮你
Nobody back there can help you.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.890
这
Uh, it's

29:25.900 --> 29:28.100
出了点问题
It's some kind of mistake.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.900
这应该行得通的
It should be working.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.990
我唯一的错误在于相信你
The only mistake I made was trusting you.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.200
萨米
Sammy.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.990
变压器有延迟
Transformer delay.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.490
这是座古老的监狱
It's an old prison.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.100
现在 如果你不介意
Now, if you don't mind

30:00.000 --> 30:02.600
我想搬进我的新牢房
I'd like to move into my new cell.

30:04.700 --> 30:07.090
谢谢你的提醒 哥们
Thank you for your words before, blanco.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.900
为勒齐工作
Working for Lechero,

30:09.900 --> 30:11.690
是件苦差事 了解?
not an easy field to plow, comprende?

30:11.700 --> 30:14.200
是呀 是呀 我知道
Oh, yeah, yeah, I comprend.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.590
你和我 我们是
You and me, we're

30:16.600 --> 30:18.000
铁哥们 我是尼弗斯
amigos, Nieves.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.190
当勒齐心情好的时候
When Lechero is in a better mood,

30:21.200 --> 30:22.800
我会去帮你美言几句
I'm going to put in a goodord, help you,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.800
怎么说的来着 知恩图报
how you say,"move up the ladder."

30:25.700 --> 30:26.490
我很感动
I appreciate

30:26.500 --> 30:29.090
但是
it, compadre, but I

30:29.100 --> 30:30.290
我的经验是
was always taught

30:30.300 --> 30:34.400
上帝会帮助那些想自救的人
that God helps those that help themselves.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
上帝与你同在
Vaya con Dios.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.190
15000美元
$15,000

31:04.200 --> 31:06.600
-为什么? -因为那就是他想要的
Why? Because that's what he wanted.

31:06.900 --> 31:09.800
放松 我会给你钱的
Relax. I'll get you the money.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.000
-我们一会见 -好的
And I will meet you there. Okay.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.800
进展的如何?
How are you holding up?

31:14.200 --> 31:15.590
正要去把这搞定
I just want to get this done.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.700
很好
Good.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.690
呆在这
Stay here.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.290
-我跟着你 -呆在这
I'm coming with you. Stay here.

31:23.300 --> 31:26.490
-你要我呆在这里空等? -我不在乎你做什么
You expect me to stay here and wait? I don't care what you do.

31:26.500 --> 31:29.600
你不在乎? 你不在乎谁啊?
You don't care? Who the hell are you to say you don't care?

31:30.500 --> 31:32.290
你不是唯一一个受此事牵连的人
You're not the only one affected by this.

31:32.300 --> 31:33.790
是的 我知道 这正是问题所在
Yeah, I know; that's the problem.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.990
那你还要继续去我行我素?
But you will still just run off and do whatever you want?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.590
你这人怎么
What kind of a man are you that just

31:37.600 --> 31:39.800
他们杀了莎拉 把她的头放在了盒子里
They killed Sara and put her head in a box

31:39.900 --> 31:41.400
他们绑架了我儿子
And they've got my son

31:52.700 --> 31:55.590
林肯 对不起
Oh, Linc, I'm . I'm sorry.

31:55.600 --> 31:56.900
你还在?
You still here?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.090
勒齐想和你谈谈
Lechero wants to talk to you.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.990
我只是去整了整头发
I was just about to get a little trim.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.990
勒齐说我可以找任何人的
Lechero said I was looking all bhuttu

32:19.000 --> 32:20.100
等着瞧吧
It'll wait.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.300
知道怎么回事么?
Did you know about this?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.290
你真不知道怎么回事?
Did you know anything about this?

32:32.300 --> 32:35.100
我? 不 不 尼弗斯
Me? No No Nieves

32:36.000 --> 32:37.790
尼弗斯 是我朋友
Nieves we was friends, man.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.000
是呀
That's right

32:41.400 --> 32:44.400
如果你明知他在注射 却不告诉我
If you knew he was using and didn't tell me

32:44.800 --> 32:46.700
他的死就算到你头上
his death is on your head.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.790
拜托 拜托 拜托
Patron, Patron, Patron

32:50.800 --> 32:52.690
毒品的事我一无所知
I don't know nothing about drugs.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.500
真不知道
I don't. I don't.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.790
我是说 上帝呀 我
I mean, hell, I

32:56.800 --> 32:58.890
我12岁就开始吸大麻
I tried me some reefer when I was 12,

32:58.900 --> 33:00.600
我只剩半条命了
I almost coughed up a lung.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.200
很好
good

33:12.100 --> 33:13.200
那好
That's good.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.800
蒂博格
Teodoro.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.000
似乎队伍不好带了
There appears to be an opening on my crew.

33:34.100 --> 33:37.190
麦格雷迪 你的十字架还给你
McGrady, here's your cross back.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.300
谢谢
And, uh thank you.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.400
你真有才
You're a real smart guy.

33:43.100 --> 33:45.000
你究竟来监狱干什么?
What the hell are you doing in prison?

33:49.300 --> 33:50.500
给
Here.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.800
很好
It's perfect.

33:56.700 --> 33:57.900
你怎么拿到它的?
How did you get it?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.600
这是你想要的 对么?
It's what you wanted, right?

34:00.300 --> 34:01.400
是的
Yeah.

34:01.900 --> 34:02.990
干得漂亮
Good work.

34:03.000 --> 34:03.890
那么接下来干什么?
So what's the next step?

34:03.900 --> 34:06.190
静观其变
Uh we wait.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.200
保持联络
And I'll keep you posted.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.500
你知道你在干嘛么?
You know what you need to do.

34:24.700 --> 34:26.100
你怎么想?
What do you think?

34:28.500 --> 34:30.700
当在那修复电力时
When i fix electricity for reason,

34:30.800 --> 34:32.190
不可能从围墙出去
but it can't have been to make that fence sizzle

34:32.200 --> 34:33.490
那样是白白送死
like the third bloody rail.
