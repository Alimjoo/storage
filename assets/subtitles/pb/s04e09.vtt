00:01.500 --> 00:02.030
《越狱》  前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

00:02.800 --> 00:03.800
你要"锡拉"做什么
What do you want with Scylla?

00:03.860 --> 00:06.030
和你一样  打垮"公司"
Same thing you want: bring down the Company.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.260
我们需要那几页
We need the pages.

00:07.330 --> 00:08.430
我们一起合作吗
Are we partners?

00:09.330 --> 00:10.530
是的
Partners.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.400
你哥哥跟我说了你流鼻血的事
So your brother told me about your nosebleeds.

00:12.460 --> 00:13.860
我很好
I'm fine.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.100
你看起来可不好
You don't look fine.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.030
对不起
Sorry.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.130
引以为戒吧
Consider this a warning.

00:21.330 --> 00:22.300
林肯  倒回去
Linc, pull back!

00:22.360 --> 00:23.300
是个圈套
It's a trap!

00:23.360 --> 00:24.630
快走  林肯
Come on, Linc!

00:24.700 --> 00:25.600
等一下
Hang on!

00:25.660 --> 00:27.960
你没事吧  你中枪了
You all right?! Damn, you're hit!

00:31.430 --> 00:33.400
好了  好了
All right, all right.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.330
你会有机会收拾他的  退后
You'll get your shot, now back off!

00:35.400 --> 00:38.060
他们是想拿我的卡
This is an attempt on my card.

00:38.130 --> 00:39.200
接下来你想怎么办
How do you want to proceed?

00:39.260 --> 00:40.260
我要转移它
I want it moved.

00:40.330 --> 00:42.030
转移"锡拉"
Move Scylla.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.460
现在
Now!

00:50.930 --> 00:54.060
告诉将军你把我们都干掉了
Now, tell the General you killed us.

00:54.130 --> 00:56.900
否则  我的手可不会歇着
Otherwise, my hand, it ain't going to get tired.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.630
我觉得你的嘴该歇歇了
I just hope your mouth gets tired.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.660
很搞笑
That's funny.

01:07.730 --> 01:09.600
走吧  老兄  走吧
Come on, buddy, come on.

01:09.660 --> 01:10.630
够了  我们走吧  林肯
Enough already, come on, Linc.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.130
现在相信我了吧
Believe me now?

01:18.200 --> 01:20.760
打他是没有用的  林肯
Beating him isn't going to work, Lincoln.

01:20.860 --> 01:22.400
你的方法也用过了
You tried your way.

01:22.460 --> 01:25.030
我们要让克兰兹将军相信怀特已经把我们解决了
We want General Krantz to think Wyatt took us out.

01:25.030 --> 01:28.200
就算你把他打到给将军打电话
Even if you do beat him to make the call to general.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.760
你觉得一个训练有素的军人
you don't think a trained military veteran

01:29.830 --> 01:31.460
听不出他话里的恐惧吗
is going to hear the fear in his voice?

01:31.530 --> 01:33.700
他们会知道他是被强迫的
They're going to know he was coerced.

01:33.700 --> 01:38.000
对付他要多点时间
Yeah,well.I need some more time with him.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.860
我明白  林肯  但是他神志不清的话也不能打电话
I hear you, Linc, but he can't make the call if he's unconscious.

01:40.930 --> 01:42.660
不管我们怎么做
However we do it,

01:42.730 --> 01:44.800
我们最好快点从怀特那里得到我们想要的
we better get what we need from Wyatt soon,

01:44.860 --> 01:46.700
马宏可等不及了
because Mahone ain't going to wait.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.060
我要找到那个杀我儿子的贱人
I'm trying to find the son of a bitch who killed my kid!

01:57.860 --> 01:59.830
丽莎  情况如何
Lisa, what are we looking at?

01:59.900 --> 02:02.030
初步估计转移"锡拉"大概要三天
Initial estimate is three days to complete the move of Scylla.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.900
我不能接受
Unacceptable.

02:05.330 --> 02:08.700
请听我说  这可不像把一台电脑
Respectfully, this is not as simple as unplugging

02:08.760 --> 02:11.000
从一间房挪到另一间房那么简单
a laptop and moving it to another room.

02:11.060 --> 02:12.400
"锡拉"里的数据太复杂了
The data on Scylla is too delicate.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.200
我不想听理由
I don't want excuses.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.400
我只关心  它能否妥善转移以及是否现在就转移
All I care is that it's done right and done right now.

02:17.460 --> 02:20.200
我明白这很紧急  但也要三天时间
I understand the urgency, but it will take three days.

02:20.260 --> 02:22.360
请允许我说几句  我觉得
And if I may speak freely, I think it's a mistake

02:22.430 --> 02:24.360
把"锡拉"转移到拉文罗克地堡
to move Scylla to the Raven Rock bunker

02:24.430 --> 02:25.800
而放弃对我们来说最安全的洛城
when the Los Angeles facility

02:25.860 --> 02:27.400
是一个错误
is one of the most secure ones we have.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.400
对我们来说最安全的地方
The most secure location we have

02:29.460 --> 02:31.060
就是不为人知的地方
is the one they don't know about.

02:31.130 --> 02:32.930
长官
Sir...

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
还是没有怀特的消息
Still no word from Wyatt.

02:34.060 --> 02:35.230
他只用"公司"提供的电话
He only uses the company-issued cell,

02:35.300 --> 02:36.530
我们追踪不到他
so we can't track him.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.200
我们无法确定
We have no way of confirming

02:38.260 --> 02:39.900
他是否完成了任务
if he successfully completed his operation.

02:39.960 --> 02:40.800
继续联系
Keep calling him!

02:40.860 --> 02:42.000
准备一份新闻稿
And draft a press release,

02:42.060 --> 02:43.500
照片  犯罪记录
photographs, criminal records,

02:43.560 --> 02:45.860
所有关于斯科菲尔德  布伦斯等人的全部资料
everything we have on Scofield, Burrows, all of them.

02:45.930 --> 02:47.660
告诉媒体的朋友  我要他们
Tell our friends in the media I want them

02:47.730 --> 02:50.200
在晚间新闻和早报里都报导
to saturate the evening news and the morning papers.

02:50.260 --> 02:51.900
我要让他们不能
I want it impossible for them

02:51.960 --> 02:54.760
大摇大摆的走在洛城的街道上
to walk down the streets of Los Angeles without being spotted.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.600
我猜我们还没在他身上
I assume we haven't made much progress

03:03.660 --> 03:05.260
得到任何进展
with our friend over there?

03:05.330 --> 03:06.130
有什么建议吗
Any suggestions?

03:06.200 --> 03:08.260
要不我们和他谈谈
How about we talk to him?

03:08.330 --> 03:10.430
好啊  要不要给他点牛奶和饼干
Great, want to give him some milk and cookies while you're at it?

03:10.500 --> 03:11.760
不是
No.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.460
随便聊聊怎么样
How about just some nice conversation?

03:22.200 --> 03:28.490

《越狱》第四季 第九集
Prison.Break.S04E09

04:00.300 --> 04:02.600
他们就叫个护士
So they sent Florence Nightingale

04:02.660 --> 04:06.100
来让我乖乖合作
to get me all ready to cooperate.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.800
实际上   不管你做了什么  我是来帮你的
Actually, I'm here to help you, despite what you've done.

04:08.860 --> 04:10.700
因为我还是医生  而你是囚犯
Because I'm still a doctor and you're a prisoner.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.460
你想要救我
You're going to save me?

04:12.530 --> 04:14.260
唐·赛尔夫带了个箱子来
Don Self has a metal case out there

04:14.330 --> 04:15.760
我不知道里面有什么
and I don't know what's in it.

04:15.830 --> 04:17.300
我猜你也不会想知道
I imagine you don't want to find out,

04:17.360 --> 04:19.630
所以  我想我们要是谈谈
so I figure if you and I had a talk...

04:19.700 --> 04:21.160
你会给我一线生机
You'd make me see the light.

04:21.230 --> 04:24.530
你要是不给将军打电话  你就死定了
If you don't call the General, you're as good as dead.

04:24.600 --> 04:30.590
我早经历过很多生不如死的事  医生
I've already been a lot of things worse than dead in my life, Doctor.

04:32.030 --> 04:34.660
你还是找个好点的理由来威胁我
You better have more than that to threaten me with.

04:38.260 --> 04:39.430
放心  迈克尔  她没事的
Come on, Mike, she's okay.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.060
他是个职业杀手
He's a professional killer.

04:41.130 --> 04:42.460
不用担心  他已经被拷起来了
Don't worry, he's locked up.

04:42.530 --> 04:43.700
我们走吧
Let's go.

04:45.230 --> 04:47.200
快点  我们走吧
Come on, let's go!

04:47.260 --> 04:49.600
你想怎么处理罗兰的尸体
So what'd you do with Roland's body?

04:49.660 --> 04:50.800
罗兰
Roland?

04:50.860 --> 04:54.060
他的资料已经全改了
He's been, uh, reconfigured

04:54.130 --> 04:55.900
而且埋在一个长眠之地
and given a permanent resting place.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.160
太好了  你走的时候顺便
Good. Take his bowling shirts

04:57.230 --> 04:58.830
把他的衣物和他的垃圾也带走
and the rest of his crap with you when you leave.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.200
算了吧  林肯  人都死了
Come on Linc, the guy died.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.560
他出卖了我们  死有余辜  贝里克
He died a punk! He ratted us out, Bellick.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.530
各位  我们先处理眼前的事
You guys, you deal with the matter at hand.

05:07.530 --> 05:09.460
假设这几张纸是正确的
Assuming these pages are correct,

05:09.530 --> 05:11.400
我们也无从考证它们是不是真的
and there's no way of knowing that they actually are...

05:13.060 --> 05:15.230
我们从地下走廊  通过锅炉房到这
we follow this basement hallway through the boiler room to here.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.200
这里是往上走的爬梯
There's some kind of elevated walkway.

05:17.260 --> 05:18.500
我们顺着走到底
We follow that to the end,

05:18.560 --> 05:20.600
这样我们就涵盖了大部分
and we've covered most of the distance

05:20.660 --> 05:22.360
从伽特到"公司"总部间的距离
between GATE and the Company's headquarters.

05:22.430 --> 05:24.430
走廊尽头的是什么东西
What's this thing at the end of the walkway?

05:24.500 --> 05:26.500
我也不知道  惠斯勒用X做了个标记
I don't know-- Whistler marked it with an "X"

05:26.560 --> 05:29.500
我想可能是面墙或大的障碍物
so I'm thinking it's some kind of wall or serious impediment.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.330
所以我们要下去做好准备
That's why we're going down there prepared.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.160
工具  电焊  锤子
Tools, thermal lances, sledgehammers...

05:34.230 --> 05:35.600
就算我们穿过了墙
Okay, so we get through that wall...

05:35.660 --> 05:36.760
另一边是什么
what's on the other side?

05:36.830 --> 05:38.600
我还不知道
Again, I don't know.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.600
因为剩下的几页在格雷琴手里
It's because Gretchen has the rest of the pages.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.260
但是一旦我们通过这个地方
But once we're through this location,

05:42.330 --> 05:44.260
除非她把几页纸给我们  否则就无法前进
we can't go any further until she gives them back.

05:44.330 --> 05:45.500
她到底耍什么诡计
What's her game in all this?

05:45.560 --> 05:47.600
如果她想把"公司"搞垮
I mean, if she wants the Company to go down,

05:47.660 --> 05:49.130
她就应该把几页纸给我们
she should just give us the pages.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.500
只要时机成熟
Look, we're going to deal with Gretchen

05:50.560 --> 05:51.930
我们就解决格雷琴
when the time is right, okay?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.530
你们要
You guys need

05:53.600 --> 05:54.660
去伽特开始准备
to go to GATE and get started.

05:54.730 --> 05:55.700
我留下来看着怀特
I'm going to stay here with Wyatt

05:55.760 --> 05:56.800
确保从他嘴里套有用的东西
and make sure we get what we need.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.500
从现在开始不能乱串
No more dawdlin' now.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.900
走快点
Move your ass.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.160
快点  先生们  快点
High gear, gentlemen, high gear.

06:07.230 --> 06:08.800
我老板随时可能会来
My boss will be here any minute.

06:12.400 --> 06:17.830
我想我不用重申谨慎行事至关重要
I assume I don't have to mention that discretion is paramount.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.560
换句话说  "沉默"是金
In other words, silence is golden.

06:21.630 --> 06:24.260
你只要确保在办公室里呆着
You just make sure you stay in your office

06:24.330 --> 06:25.900
别让别人进来
and you keep other people out.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.300
我会呆在舒适
Oh, I'll stay in my nice,

06:27.360 --> 06:28.800
凉快的办公室里的  小白脸
air-conditioned office, Pretty.

06:28.860 --> 06:30.700
你现在可以爬你的小洞里去了
And you can crawl down into your little hole now.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.600
快
Go ahead.

06:32.660 --> 06:35.430
快
Go ahead.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.360
快  爬吧
Go ahead, crawl.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.560
科尔  这里到底出什么事了
Cole? What the hell is going on here?

06:47.630 --> 06:49.660
怀特先生  你回来了
Mr. White, are you back already?

06:49.730 --> 06:50.830
你好吗
How are you?

06:50.900 --> 06:52.500
很好  直到我收到一封安德鲁·布劳努
Fine, until I found a resignation fax

06:52.560 --> 06:56.030
发来的辞职传真
waiting for me from Andrew Blauner.

06:57.030 --> 06:58.000
辞职信
A resignation?

06:58.060 --> 06:59.530
对  打电话也不接
Yeah, I can't get him on the phone,

06:59.600 --> 07:01.000
我打给他未婚妻
I reached out to his fiancee,

07:01.060 --> 07:02.400
她也不知道没有他的消息
she hasn't seen or heard from him.

07:02.460 --> 07:04.200
她非常担心
She's worried sick.

07:04.260 --> 07:06.400
他可能就是喝大了
He's probably on a bit of a bender,

07:06.460 --> 07:07.660
睡在什么地方了
just sleeping it off somewhere.

07:07.730 --> 07:09.530
布劳努可是名童子军
Blauner? He's a Boy Scout.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.430
这不合逻辑  科尔
None of this makes any sense, Cole.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.500
不过我告诉你
But I'll tell you what,

07:13.560 --> 07:15.330
我会查清楚的
I'm going to look into it.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.260
有需要我帮忙的地方  就告诉我
Let me know if I can be of any assistance.

07:20.330 --> 07:21.930
早上好
Good morning.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.660
帮忙
Assistance...

07:31.960 --> 07:34.060
那是什么声音
What is that sound?

07:46.130 --> 07:47.230
喂
Yeah?

07:47.300 --> 07:50.230
我希望能有个愉快的早晨
I hope you're having a lovely enjoyable morning,

07:50.300 --> 07:51.560
因为你不在的时候
because while you are nowhere to be found,

07:51.630 --> 07:52.930
这边已经在调查
there is sleuthing going on here

07:53.000 --> 07:55.100
安德鲁·布劳努的下落了
regarding the whereabouts of one Mr. Andrew Blauner.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.960
还有吗
And?

07:57.030 --> 07:58.660
如果我卷进这起凶杀案的话
And if I'm going down for this little homicide,

07:58.730 --> 08:00.000
我可不会一个人背黑锅
I ain't going alone.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.660
我们肯定是形影不离的
We're going together like traffic and weather.

08:01.730 --> 08:02.930
放松点  好吗
Relax, okay?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.460
他们绝对找不到我放尸体的地方
They'll never find the body where I put it.

08:05.530 --> 08:08.830
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯现在在哪
Now, where are Scofield and Burrows?

08:08.900 --> 08:10.660
正在履行他们的承诺
Just doing their end of the bargain.

08:10.730 --> 08:13.200
顺便问一下  你到底在干嘛
Which begs the question, what the hell are you doing?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.260
我
Me?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.960
我准备去会一个人
I'm getting ready for a meeting.

08:23.900 --> 08:27.100
你朋友一直打电话给你
So, your friends have been calling a lot.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.200
他们一定在想你到哪儿去了
They must be wondering where you are.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.430
没错
That's right.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.330
他们在怀疑  而他们怀疑得越久
They're wondering, and the longer they do,

08:33.400 --> 08:34.930
你们就越危险
the more danger you're in.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.530
打电话给将军  照他们的话说
Call the General, and say what they want you to say.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.600
然后呢  你们会放我走吗
And what? You'll let me go?

08:39.660 --> 08:41.760
不会  但唐·赛尔夫能确保
No, but Don Self will make sure

08:41.830 --> 08:43.000
你免于死刑
that you spend the rest of your life

08:43.060 --> 08:45.200
下半辈子悠闲自在
in a decent facility without the death penalty.

08:47.130 --> 08:48.630
无论如何
Either way,

08:48.700 --> 08:50.960
无论我打不打这通电话
if I make the call or not,

08:51.030 --> 08:53.030
我都会死
I'm dead.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.700
你心里明白的很
You know that.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.700
我们都清楚  你作为一名医生
And we both know that you, as a doctor,

08:58.760 --> 09:00.730
不会容许这种事情发生
won't let that happen.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.760
所以  不如
So, please,

09:02.830 --> 09:04.830
我们一起想个
let's you and I figure a way

09:04.900 --> 09:10.000
互惠互利的解决办法
out of this mess that works for everybody.

09:34.060 --> 09:35.660
-坐好  -别挡路
Sit your ass down! Get out of my way!

09:35.730 --> 09:36.960
别 别这样
Out! Out!

09:37.030 --> 09:39.300
不然我会把你按在桌子上的
I will cuff your ass to that table, okay?

09:39.360 --> 09:40.960
我知道这很痛苦
All right, I know this is hard.

09:41.030 --> 09:42.930
我也知道你想干什么
And I know what you want to do.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.800
可是我们正在努力做事
Okay, but I'm trying to do something here

09:44.860 --> 09:46.530
你必须接受现实
and you need to deal with that reality.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.260
你有失去孩子吗
Have you lost a kid?

09:48.330 --> 09:49.330
我失去过
Yeah, I did, too.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.700
我老婆当时怀孕
My wife was pregnant.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.830
她有并发症  而那个庸医不会处理
And there were complications and the doctor messed up.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.330
而她
And she...

09:57.400 --> 10:00.360
他们都
And they both...

10:00.430 --> 10:01.830
他们都死了
They didn't make it.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.600
行了吧  我感同身受
Okay? So I understand.

10:04.930 --> 10:08.500
如果你是我  你会怎么做
What would you do if you were me

10:08.560 --> 10:10.530
如果坐在那里的就是那个庸医
and that doctor was right there?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.530
你会怎样
What would you do?

10:12.600 --> 10:14.630
我也不知道我会怎样
I don't know what I would do.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.960
听着  我向你保证
Look, I'm giving you my word.

10:16.030 --> 10:18.900
一旦时机成熟  我绝对不会阻拦你
When the time is right, I won't stand in your way.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.300
到时候你也拦不住我
When the time is right I won't let you.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.960
行  行
Okay. Okay.

10:24.030 --> 10:25.860
你们看到马宏看怀特的样子吗
Did you see the way  Mahone was looking at Wyatt?

10:25.930 --> 10:27.760
那家伙很伤心
The guy is hurting.

10:27.830 --> 10:30.260
不是伤心那么简单  简直就是煎熬
It was more than just hurting, that's pain.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.300
我从来没有那么在意一件事
I never cared about anything like that.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.200
看看我这辈子
I look at what I've done with my life,

10:34.260 --> 10:36.860
在福克斯河监狱作威作福  捞钱
beating on cons at Fox River, chasing money,

10:36.930 --> 10:39.200
努力离开监狱
trying to keep my own ass out of prison.

10:39.260 --> 10:41.030
这就是你说的那条小路吗
This the pathway you talking about?

10:41.100 --> 10:42.360
根据地图
According to the map,

10:42.430 --> 10:44.360
这条路几乎有整个中庭那么长
this runs almost the length of that courtyard.

10:44.430 --> 10:46.660
它应该直接通向"公司"总部的下方
It should put us directly beneath Company headquarters.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.930
嘘  听
Shh, listen.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.400
又是这种声音
There it is again.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.430
那是什么声音  斯科菲尔德
What's that noise, Scofield?

10:52.500 --> 10:54.560
不知道
I don't know.

10:54.630 --> 10:57.000
那么我们都清楚  我们要爬上楼梯
Okay, just so we're clear, we get to go up that ladder

10:57.060 --> 10:58.930
去往那个不明声音的来源地
towards the noise that we don't know what it is.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.200
如果走运的话  我们就基本能
But if we're lucky, we get to basically just

11:02.260 --> 11:03.900
潜进"公司"
walk smack into the Company?

11:03.960 --> 11:06.060
没错
Sounds about right.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.200
你要上去吗
You up for it?

11:08.260 --> 11:10.600
当然  紧随你后
Oh, yeah, after you.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.630
我跟坐在那边的
I am no different than that man

11:16.700 --> 11:20.060
那个想杀我的人没什么不同
over there... who wants to kill me.

11:20.130 --> 11:23.400
亚历山大·马宏是被迫为"公司"卖命
Alexander Mahone was forced to do things by the Company,

11:23.460 --> 11:24.960
我也一样
and so was I.

11:25.030 --> 11:26.360
但我认识一些人
But I know people.

11:26.430 --> 11:28.530
在政府做事的人
People in government.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.530
他们能帮你和迈克尔
People that can help you and Michael.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.130
我可以给你一个电话号码
I can give you a phone number.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.560
可以安排一下
Arrangements can be made.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.200
你只要相信我
All you have to do is trust me

11:40.260 --> 11:43.500
一切都可以结束
and this will all be over.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.160
已经结束了
It is over.

12:03.760 --> 12:07.200
怀特有布劳努的新消息吗
Has, um, White had anything new to say about Blauner?

12:07.260 --> 12:09.800
没有  但他可能会有
No, but he might.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.430
普发先生
Mr. Pfeiffer?

12:15.660 --> 12:17.530
正是本人
That would be moi.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.960
康纳·莫拉侦探
Detective Conor Mara.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.260
我想跟你谈谈安德鲁·布劳努的事
I was hoping I could talk to you about Andrew Blauner.

12:21.330 --> 12:22.960
当然可以
Of course.

12:23.030 --> 12:24.230
太好了
Great.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.030
从这下去
It's down this way.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.760
找到了
This is it!

13:31.830 --> 13:34.330
这就是那种声音的来源
This is where the sound was coming from.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.530
洛城其中一条供水的主水管
One of the main conduit pipes for the LA water supply.

13:37.600 --> 13:44.060
每秒3万加仑的水
30,000 gallons of water rushing through this very spot.

13:44.130 --> 13:46.530
-流经这里  -那完了
Every second. Oh, great.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.760
有其他路可以绕过这家伙吗
There's got to be some other way to get around it,

13:48.830 --> 13:49.830
其他通道什么的
some other pathway or something.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.660
没有  我们从唯一一条通道下来
No, we took the only pathway down

13:51.730 --> 13:52.960
直接来到这里
and it leads right here.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.730
从上面越过怎么样
How about over it?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.900
我们不能冒险太接近地面挖隧道
We can't risk tunneling too close to the surface.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.460
那怎么办
What do we do?

14:01.130 --> 14:03.100
挖
We dig.

14:04.230 --> 14:05.400
不瞒您说
Truth be told, uh,

14:05.460 --> 14:07.160
布劳努先生还不算真正失踪
Mr. Blauner isn't officially a missing person,

14:07.230 --> 14:09.960
但他的未婚妻有个堂妹在市长办公室工作
but his fiancee has a cousin at the mayor's office

14:10.030 --> 14:11.600
所以  就是这样
so, here we are.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.400
就是这样
Here we are.

14:13.460 --> 14:14.930
但并不是说
Hey, that's not to say though that there

14:15.000 --> 14:15.960
就没有可担心的事
aren't some things that concern me.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.200
是吗  比如呢
Really? Such as?

14:19.260 --> 14:21.860
怀特办公室收到的传真
Well, the fax that came into White's office

14:21.930 --> 14:23.260
是在一家复印店传的
came from a copy shop,

14:23.330 --> 14:26.200
但布劳努家里有传真机
but Blauner had a fax machine at his house.

14:27.260 --> 14:28.730
还有呢
Okay.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.130
他辞职大约半小时后
And about a half hour after he resigned,

14:30.200 --> 14:32.060
有人看到他的车从伽特车库驶出
his car was seen leaving the GATE garage.

14:32.130 --> 14:34.130
司机的身份现在无法确认
Now, the driver couldn't be identified,

14:34.200 --> 14:36.000
但很明确驾驶员
but it appeared as though a woman's hands

14:36.060 --> 14:37.600
是位女性
were seen gripping the steering wheel.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.560
容我打断一下
Let me stop you right there.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.400
我一直觉得布劳努先生
It always seemed to me that Mr. Blauner was,

14:42.460 --> 14:44.600
怎么说比较恰当呢
how can I put this delicately,

14:44.660 --> 14:46.560
是个"贱"客
um, a swordsman.

14:46.630 --> 14:47.660
明白我的意思吗
You know what I mean?

14:47.730 --> 14:49.230
说实话  不懂
Actually, I don't.

14:50.900 --> 14:54.030
他可是到处播种
He might be dipping his snout into a different trough,

14:54.100 --> 14:56.830
而她未婚妻却蒙在鼓里
and the fiancee is none the wiser.

14:56.900 --> 15:01.230
但据其他同事所说
From what I've, uh, heard about him from his other co-workers,

15:01.300 --> 15:03.230
这似乎不太可能
that doesn't sound too likely.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.600
冒昧问一下  那个敲击声是怎么回事
If you don't mind me asking, what is that banging noise?

15:05.660 --> 15:07.500
那是
That's, uh...

15:07.560 --> 15:09.360
管道问题
it's trouble with the pipes.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.160
是管道松了  以前有点震动
You know, they loosened up, it was a moderate quake

15:12.230 --> 15:14.630
现在比以前震的更厉害了
and now they shake more than the trembler itself.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.460
普发先生  有人告诉我
Mr. Pfeiffer, uh, some people here

15:16.530 --> 15:18.100
你和布劳努有隙
have told me that you and Blauner didn't get along.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.430
你能否说下这个问题
Would you mind talking to me a little bit about that?

15:23.060 --> 15:25.230
几年前  我和一个搭档也用这招对付
A few years ago, a partner of mine did this same move

15:25.300 --> 15:26.730
在新墨西哥边界抓到的
against an enemy combatant we picked up

15:26.800 --> 15:29.660
犯人  这家伙嘴巴很紧
at the New Mexico border-- this guy didn't want to talk,

15:29.730 --> 15:31.760
他什么都说不知道
he didn't know anything.

15:31.830 --> 15:35.560
当时很有用  现在也应该行
It worked then, it should work now.

15:41.430 --> 15:45.200
你给我们弄回来的救护车还在外面吗
Is that ambulance you got us still out back?

15:45.260 --> 15:48.530
是的
Yeah.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.700
加油  伙计  我当年追捕你们半天
Hey, come on, pal, I got almost a decade on you

16:00.760 --> 16:02.160
都不见我喘半口气
and you don't see me sucking air.

16:02.230 --> 16:03.400
布拉德  我中弹了
I got shot, Brad.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.000
是啊
Oh, yeah.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.330
兄弟们  没进展啊
Guys, we ain't making any progress here.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.630
水泥层下只有花岗岩
There's nothing beneath this cement but granite.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.630
用手提钻是穿不过去的
We couldn't get through it with a jackhammer.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.830
也许我们该回仓库看看
Maybe we should go back to the warehouse,

16:12.900 --> 16:14.130
另找出路
find another way.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.830
没有其他出路  只有这里
There is no other way. This is it!

16:15.900 --> 16:18.460
这就是计划所向  只能从这条路找"锡拉"
This is where the plans lead; this is our way to Scylla.

16:18.530 --> 16:19.860
什么
What?

16:19.930 --> 16:22.260
这排泄管里有数百万加仑的水
We got millions of gallons of water in this drain pipe.

16:22.330 --> 16:24.330
我们下不去  也越不过去
We can't go under it, we can't go over it.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.760
我知道
I know.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.570
或许我们能穿过去
Maybe we can go through it.

16:46.220 --> 16:48.190
松了
It's loose!

16:50.490 --> 16:54.050
好了  林肯  这应该管用
All right, Linc, this ought to do it.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.920
我搞定之后  我们有多长时间
After I'm done, how much time we got?

16:55.990 --> 16:57.720
不多
Not a lot.

16:57.790 --> 16:59.090
小心点
Be careful.

16:59.150 --> 17:00.590
你也是
You, too.

17:08.590 --> 17:12.520
我小时候  养了只公猫叫鲁弗斯
When I was a little boy, I had an old tomcat named Rufus.

17:12.590 --> 17:15.090
它很擅长抓老鼠
He was a good mouser.

17:15.150 --> 17:19.020
尖牙利爪  很彪悍的猫
Tough as nails, solid feline all around.

17:19.120 --> 17:21.290
有一天  我在大卖场外面
One day, I bring home this little kitty

17:21.350 --> 17:23.550
捡回一只小猫咪
from a giveaway box outside the Pic 'N Save.

17:23.620 --> 17:26.750
老鲁弗斯一点也喜欢它
Old Rufus didn't like that one bit.

17:26.820 --> 17:29.520
它耸起背  像响尾蛇一样丝丝叫
He arched his back, hissed like a rattlesnake

17:29.590 --> 17:32.550
想弹簧刀一般伸出爪子
and sprang out his claws like a switchblade.

17:32.620 --> 17:34.590
你知道
You know,

17:34.650 --> 17:37.090
这小猫咪没做错什么
That new little kitty didn't do nothing wrong

17:37.150 --> 17:39.220
只是个新来的
but be new.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.990
我现在也是如此
Now, that's all I did.

17:41.050 --> 17:43.350
我是新来的  布劳努是
I was being new, and Blauner was being

17:43.420 --> 17:45.850
那只划清自己领地的老猫
this old tomcat spraying his territory.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.220
但我不是针对他
Now, I don't hold that against him.

17:48.290 --> 17:51.020
如果他不这么做  我倒会怀疑他人格有问题
If he didn't protect his turf I'd question his character.

17:51.090 --> 17:53.650
但除了他的嫉妒以外
But aside from a little jealousy on his part,

17:53.720 --> 17:57.320
我们之间就像纸一样薄
our issues were as thin as tissues.

17:57.390 --> 17:58.450
我向你保证
I assure you that.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.150
侦探  我把布劳努的行程安排
Detective, I pulled Blauner's travel schedule

18:02.220 --> 18:03.520
-按你的要求打出来了  -谢谢
as per your request. Thank you.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.690
这是怎么回事
Uh, what's this?

18:07.850 --> 18:10.150
先生  我们得出去
Uh, sir, uh, we need to step out

18:10.220 --> 18:12.690
拿一些做架子的角板
for a few more bracket-joints for the shelving.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.820
没问题
Uh, all right, yeah.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.890
但你们出去吃吃喝喝
But I ain't paying you to stop for, uh,

18:17.950 --> 18:20.490
我可不会付钱给你们  快去快回
a coffee and donuts, so get back here toot sweet.

18:20.550 --> 18:22.620
等等我  曼纽尔
Hey, wait up, Manuel.

18:22.690 --> 18:25.620
我雇了几个人  当然是自己掏腰包
I hired some men, uh, out of my own pocket of course,

18:25.690 --> 18:27.550
来修整一下
to, uh, add some built-in uh,

18:27.620 --> 18:30.390
我的储物室  希望你别介意
uh, storage in my closet-- I hope you don't mind.

18:30.450 --> 18:33.390
没问题
Nah.

18:33.450 --> 18:35.550
这是他的每月细目
Here's the monthly breakdown of where he traveled...

18:41.620 --> 18:43.620
你要跟我谈吗
You're gonna talk to me now?

18:43.690 --> 18:45.490
我  不
Me? No.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.590
我们没什么好谈的
We're done talking...

18:47.650 --> 18:48.920
但你还得说
But you're not.

18:51.290 --> 18:54.020
他们都死了  结束了
They are all dead. It's over.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.750
一切都可以结束
This will all be over.

18:58.150 --> 18:59.720
一切都可以结束
This will all be over.

19:01.950 --> 19:03.150
完了
It's over.

19:03.220 --> 19:05.220
他们都死了  他们都死了
They are dead. They are all dead.

19:05.290 --> 19:06.550
结束了
It's over.

19:08.950 --> 19:11.950
我要把这个拿走
I'm going to take this.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.690
赛尔夫
Self...

19:21.490 --> 19:24.620
你们能回避吗
Can you take a walk?

19:24.690 --> 19:28.650
可以
Yeah.

19:33.420 --> 19:35.590
走吧  莎拉  我们该走了
Come on, Sara, we should go.

19:37.390 --> 19:40.120
我们出去吧
Let's go outside.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.420
我儿子的尸检显示他
My son's autopsy report said that he'd...

20:03.490 --> 20:05.790
他中了两枪
that he'd been shot twice.

20:05.850 --> 20:08.050
一枪在肚子上
Once in the stomach...

20:11.450 --> 20:14.320
为什么
Why, man?

20:16.190 --> 20:19.720
为什么  就为了恐吓我妻子
Why?! Just to terrify my wife?!

20:24.520 --> 20:27.350
五分钟后
And then a full five minutes later,

20:27.420 --> 20:30.550
打在
right in the...

20:34.150 --> 20:37.320
你也要承受一下
You too will suffer.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.090
当
And when...

20:41.150 --> 20:44.590
当你也无法承受疼痛时
and when you can't stand the pain anymore,

20:44.650 --> 20:47.620
你就要为我打个电话
you'll make a phone call for me.

20:47.690 --> 20:51.890
斯科菲尔德说酷刑没有用
You know, Scofield said that torture wouldn't work

20:51.950 --> 20:53.750
因为将军会从你的声音中听出恐惧
because the General would hear the fear in your voice.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.020
但事实上
But the thing is...

20:56.720 --> 20:58.950
我正是要让电话那头的人
...I want the person on the other end

20:59.020 --> 21:00.650
从你的声音中听到
of my call to hear the fear

21:00.720 --> 21:04.020
恐惧
in your voice.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.020
先生  这是新闻稿
Press release, sir.

21:10.090 --> 21:11.620
简而言之  就是说福科斯河监狱的
In short, it sets forth that members

21:11.690 --> 21:13.090
八个逃犯和帮凶
of the Fox River Eight and their accomplices

21:13.150 --> 21:15.450
都还活着并就在洛城
are alive and well in Los Angeles.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.890
你去哪了
Where have you been?

21:25.090 --> 21:26.520
他们都死了
They are all dead.

21:26.590 --> 21:29.520
-都结束了  -干得好
It's over. Good work.

21:29.590 --> 21:32.350
你的报酬会放在约定的地方
Your payment will be left where we arranged.

21:40.420 --> 21:42.520
这个已经没必要了
This is no longer necessary.

21:46.550 --> 21:48.390
别轻举妄动
Go ahead.

21:51.090 --> 21:52.420
秘密入口的
The access code

21:52.490 --> 21:53.990
密码还是
to the covert entrance

21:54.050 --> 21:55.820
你两个女儿的生日
is still both your daughters' birthdays.

21:55.890 --> 21:58.420
所有人都出去
Everyone leave us alone.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.190
我说
I said

22:02.250 --> 22:05.850
所有人都出去
everyone leave us alone.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.950
不会有事的
It's okay.

22:10.190 --> 22:12.020
她不会伤害我
She won't hurt me.

22:22.490 --> 22:24.020
丽莎
Lisa...

22:37.290 --> 22:39.890
我就知道你会回家
I knew you'd come home.

22:49.550 --> 22:51.390
你怎么挺得住
So, how are you holding up, you know,

22:51.450 --> 22:53.190
没有LJ和大家陪在身边
not being with LJ and all?

22:53.250 --> 22:56.450
没什么  他是个好孩子  他会照顾好自己
Good, he's a smart kid. He can look after himself.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.020
我能看出来你很爱他
I can see it, how much you love him.

22:59.090 --> 23:01.220
我还很小  我爸就去世了
My dad died when I was a little kid.

23:01.290 --> 23:02.950
但他是个好父亲
But he was a good father.

23:03.020 --> 23:05.820
我们还是集中精力完成任务吧
Let's just focus and get this thing done, all right?

23:11.790 --> 23:13.590
迈克尔说手动控制
Michael said the manual override

23:13.650 --> 23:15.190
应该就在主管道附近
should be somewhere near the main conduit.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.220
你觉得这个像主管道吗
This look like the main conduit to you?

23:17.290 --> 23:19.520
有办法弄明白
One way to find out.

23:30.650 --> 23:32.650
你觉得这个像吗
That look like it to you?

23:32.720 --> 23:33.690
像
Looks like it.

23:33.750 --> 23:34.950
把它点着
Fire it up.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.790
好了  我们走吧
All right, let's get out of here.

23:49.850 --> 23:51.120
快点  哥们
Hurry up, bro!

23:51.190 --> 23:53.120
就快好了 兄弟
Almost done, buddy.

23:53.190 --> 23:54.950
好了  把它挪回去
All right, ease it back.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.020
搞定了
It worked.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.950
我们有多长时间
How long we got?

24:16.020 --> 24:19.350
不清楚
I don't know.

24:19.420 --> 24:21.650
千万人的水源被切断
Water cut off to thousands of people.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.190
政府会在一个小时左右抢修
The city will probably have that taken care of in about an hour,

24:24.250 --> 24:27.650
意味着我们有60分钟
which means we've got... 60 minutes

24:27.720 --> 24:29.590
做90分钟的工作
to do 90 minutes worth of work.

24:29.650 --> 24:31.820
否则我们就得不到"锡拉"
Or we don't get to Scylla.

24:43.050 --> 24:44.650
怎么了  老兄
What's wrong, papi?

24:51.890 --> 24:54.690
迈克
Mike.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.990
迈克尔  迈克尔
Michael! Michael!

24:57.050 --> 24:58.550
怎么了  兄弟
What's wrong, papi?!

24:58.620 --> 24:59.890
兄弟  说话啊
Papi, talk to me!

24:59.950 --> 25:01.920
你怎么了  说话啊
What's wrong?! Talk to me!

25:01.990 --> 25:02.950
迈克尔
Michael!

25:03.020 --> 25:06.520
迈克尔  你怎么了
Michael, what's wrong?!

25:15.720 --> 25:18.160
想喝水吗
You want some water?

25:18.220 --> 25:19.820
我没事
I'm okay.

25:19.890 --> 25:22.020
兄弟  你现在背负过重
You're a lot of things right now, my friend,

25:22.090 --> 25:24.390
而却没有背负"没事"
and okay ain't one of them.

25:24.460 --> 25:30.860
你知道  我可能不是最聪明的人
You know, I may not be the smartest guy,

25:30.920 --> 25:32.790
但我听到了
but I hear things.

25:32.860 --> 25:35.220
莎拉和你哥哥
Sara and your brother

25:35.290 --> 25:39.620
谈过有关你的身体健康的问题
have been talking about you not feeling well or something.

25:39.690 --> 25:43.690
听着  我只是  只是说说
Look, I'm just, I'm just saying.

25:49.590 --> 25:52.720
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

25:52.790 --> 25:56.460
所以  请你
So, please, just, uh...

25:56.520 --> 25:58.820
帮我瞒着
...cover for me.

25:58.820 --> 26:00.820
没问题
You got it.

26:12.420 --> 26:16.590
事实上  格雷琴  我比你更了解你自己
Truth is, Gretchen, I know you better than you know yourself.

26:17.620 --> 26:20.320
你一直这么跟我说
So you keep telling me.

26:20.390 --> 26:23.620
我初次见你时  你才20岁
When I first met you, you were a 20 year old girl

26:23.690 --> 26:25.760
由于心理评估失败
who'd just been dumped by the Wheeling Police Academy

26:25.820 --> 26:28.920
你被惠灵警官学院开除了
for failing her psych evaluation.

26:28.990 --> 26:32.490
但那些佛吉尼亚老脑筋
But where those good old West Virginia boys

26:32.560 --> 26:35.890
只能看出一种具有
could only see an emotional disconnect

26:35.960 --> 26:38.590
反社会倾向的情绪反常
with traces of sociopathic tendencies,

26:38.660 --> 26:42.360
我看到的是一个能
I saw a Machiavellian streak

26:42.420 --> 26:44.790
让失败成为不可能的足智多谋的人
that would make failure an impossibility.

26:44.860 --> 26:47.420
我只能让怀特那么做
I had to let Wyatt do what he did

26:47.490 --> 26:48.820
因为我想知道
because I needed to know...

26:50.890 --> 26:53.720
是否我的斗牛犬已得知惠斯勒
...what my little bulldog may have known

26:53.790 --> 26:56.720
以及他想得到关锡拉的计划
about Whistler and his plans for Scylla.

26:57.890 --> 27:01.420
我说过我什么也不知道
I told you that I knew nothing.

27:01.490 --> 27:03.860
你应该相信我
You should have believed me.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.760
我知道你从不义气用事
I knew you'd never take it personally,

27:06.820 --> 27:11.660
因为从你成为我的左右手开始
because you are, and have been

27:11.720 --> 27:16.360
你就是  也一直是
ever since I took you under my wing...

27:16.420 --> 27:18.090
我的女人
...my girl.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.990
我的女人
My girl.

27:42.390 --> 27:44.560
最敏感的神经末梢就在这里
The most sensitive nerve endings are right here.

27:44.620 --> 27:47.320
这就是为什么针灸医生都会避免
That's why acupuncturists avoid placing needles

27:47.390 --> 27:49.120
在任何接近这个位置用针  因为
anywhere near them because opening up

27:49.190 --> 27:51.220
指尖的神经末端
the nerve endings in the fingertip--

27:51.290 --> 27:52.720
就算只刺到一点
even a little pinprick--

27:52.790 --> 27:56.160
都能引起极大的灼热痛楚
can result in quite a painful hot flash.

27:57.790 --> 27:58.960
所以一根5英寸长的针
So a five inch needle

27:59.020 --> 28:01.390
插入一指的长度
being driven up the length of the finger...

28:05.190 --> 28:08.160
能让你体内感觉被火燃烧一般
...can make your insides feel like they're on fire.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.090
生理学的另一方面说
Another fact of physiology,

28:11.160 --> 28:13.860
当人体无法承受极端的压迫时会休克
the human body when in extreme duress begins to shut down.

28:13.920 --> 28:18.190
大脑活动减弱  心率也会下降
Brain activity decreases and your heart rate slows

28:18.260 --> 28:20.460
直到你再也感觉不到疼痛
until you just can't feel the pain anymore.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.490
这就是心电图和电击的作用
And that's where the heart monitor and the battery come in.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.820
因为当你的心率降到50以下
'Cause when your heart rate dips below 50,

28:24.890 --> 28:27.520
电击就会给你一个苏醒的信号
that battery will give you a wake-up call,

28:27.590 --> 28:29.660
避免你的身体休克
preventing your body from shutting down.

28:29.720 --> 28:33.390
你才能感受到任何一丁点的
And then you will feel every ounce...

28:33.460 --> 28:35.390
疼痛
of the pain.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.720
到时候你会求着让我打电话
And that's when you're going to beg me to make the phone call.

28:53.220 --> 28:54.620
有什么可以帮你吗
What can I do you for?

28:56.020 --> 28:57.360
我在你的销售报告里找到
I... I found some more inconsistencies

28:57.420 --> 28:58.490
一些矛盾的地方
in your sales reports.

29:08.620 --> 29:09.760
听着
Listen up here.

29:09.820 --> 29:11.190
你的电脑可不可以
From that little computer of yours,

29:11.260 --> 29:13.120
读取伽特的数据
can you access into GATE's records?

29:14.560 --> 29:16.790
如果用管理员身份登陆的话
If I access the network as an administrator,

29:16.860 --> 29:19.060
我能以非pdf格式浏览文件
I can see the files in a non-PDF format.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.390
我不知道什么意思  但我认为你可以办到
I don't know what that means, but I assume it was a yes.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.890
所以随你怎么敲键盘
So you let your fingers do the walking across that keyboard

29:23.960 --> 29:25.360
把我的销售报告拿给我
and you get me my sales records.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.460
你弄伤我的手臂了
You are hurting my arm.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.320
最好别让我伤害其他部位
And don't make me hurt any more of you.

29:28.390 --> 29:29.560
现在就去
Now, go.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.090
做的好
That's good work.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.920
给
Here.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.160
我要你测量下这个洞
I need you to measure this hole.

30:16.960 --> 30:20.220
在对面的墙上打个同等大小的洞
And then make one of the same size in the wall opposite.

30:20.290 --> 30:21.590
怎么弄
How?

30:21.660 --> 30:24.120
你有系腰带吧
You got a belt?

30:26.220 --> 30:28.790
好了
Okay.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.990
在水再次灌满水管之前
We have less than 30 minutes

30:53.060 --> 30:56.320
我们还有不到半小时时间
until this pipe is flooded with water again.

31:25.790 --> 31:27.860
接受现实是很重要的  怀特
Acceptance is important, Wyatt.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.320
我必须接受我儿子已经死了
I had to accept that my son is gone.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.790
而你也必须接受你的生命
And you have to accept that your life,

31:33.860 --> 31:37.560
你所剩无几的生命
your very, very short life-span ahead of you

31:37.620 --> 31:41.260
将充满无法忍受的疼痛
is just going to be filled with agonizing pain.

31:41.320 --> 31:44.060
直到你按我的要求去做
At least until you do what I've asked of you.

31:44.120 --> 31:47.560
到那时
And then...

31:47.620 --> 31:50.720
痛苦将会离你而去
then the pain will go away.

31:59.620 --> 32:01.090
我们快没时间了
We're running out of time!

32:05.890 --> 32:07.160
-不会吧  -怎么了
- Man.  - What's wrong?

32:08.220 --> 32:09.590
这该死的东西居然空了
The stupid thing is empty!

32:10.660 --> 32:12.680
那么
All right.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.900
我进去吧
I'm coming in.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.060
老兄  你不行了
You can't do this, bro.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.290
赶紧干完再说
Just finish it.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.720
喂
Hello?

32:43.790 --> 32:45.020
是我
It's me.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.820
怎么了
What's going on?

32:46.890 --> 32:50.820
有人要告诉你一些事
Somebody needs to tell you something.

32:53.860 --> 32:55.760
用她的姓称呼她
You call her by her first name.

33:02.290 --> 33:03.460
潘姆
Pam...

33:07.520 --> 33:12.020
我很抱歉
I'm... sorry.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.060
一切都结束了
It's over.

33:20.090 --> 33:22.060
我爱你
And I love you.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.290
我爱你
I love you.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.190
这东西太沉了
This thing is heavy!

33:52.990 --> 33:55.160
太好了  苦力活干完了你们才来
Sure, show up when all the hard work is done.

33:55.220 --> 33:57.220
好了  松后点
All right, ease it back.

33:57.290 --> 33:58.590
我们听电台说
We heard on the radio

33:58.660 --> 34:01.320
水利部门会在10分钟内恢复供水
that DWP is going to have the water running in 10 minutes.

34:04.790 --> 34:05.760
你没事吧
You all right?

34:06.820 --> 34:09.360
管子太重了
The sleeve is too heavy

34:09.420 --> 34:10.990
很难塞过排水管
to just slide it through the pipe.

34:11.060 --> 34:13.760
必须有2个人进去
Two of us are going to have to go inside

34:13.820 --> 34:15.490
引它穿过另一个洞口
and guide it through that other hole.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.090
水流随时可能从排水管冲过来
That pipe can flood at any time.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.360
我上
I'll do it.

34:19.420 --> 34:20.420
我也上
I'll go, too.

34:21.820 --> 34:22.790
不  让我来
No, I'll go.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.590
优等生  并非冒犯
Oh, no offense, college boy,

34:24.660 --> 34:26.260
但这大家伙太重了
but this sucker's heavy.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.760
你得再强壮点才行
You're going to need a little bulk down there.

34:27.820 --> 34:30.020
好吧
All right.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.020
你们把它推过另一边时
Use this to brace the sleeve

34:34.090 --> 34:35.920
用这个支撑水管
when you pull it through to the other side.

34:35.990 --> 34:41.190
然后  我们一起离开这里  好吗
And Let's get the hell out of there, all right?

34:49.190 --> 34:51.160
艾咪还好吗
How's Emmy?

34:51.220 --> 34:53.120
我来这不是听你
I didn't come here to listen to you

34:53.190 --> 34:57.460
假装关心她  或关心我
Pretend to care about her...or me.

34:59.220 --> 35:02.590
我来此是要告诉你  我是现在是空闲探员
I came here to tell you that I'm a free agent now.

35:02.660 --> 35:05.620
我们经营的集团知道我还活着且可以雇用
The community we run with know that I'm alive and available.

35:07.390 --> 35:11.690
我可以像为你卖命一样为他们卖命
I can just as easily work for one of them as I can for you.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.990
所以问题在于  你出价多少
So the question is, what's your offer?

35:14.060 --> 35:17.120
实际上  你的问题是
Actually, the question for you is

35:17.190 --> 35:18.790
何必去其他地方呢
why would you want to go anywhere else?

35:18.860 --> 35:21.290
现在不是记仇的时候  格雷琴
It's not a time for grudges, Gretchen.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.920
是我们联手的时机
It's a time for coming together.

35:23.990 --> 35:26.660
好日子就快到来了
The salad days are fast approaching.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.160
老挝那边进展顺利
Laos worked perfectly.

35:29.390 --> 35:31.520
民众很快会投奔我们
Soon the populace will turn to us--

35:31.590 --> 35:32.920
军队  财政  能源的首领们
the leaders of the military,

35:32.990 --> 35:35.990
都会与我们为伍
finance and energy-- to right the ship.

35:36.060 --> 35:37.790
然后
And then...

35:37.860 --> 35:40.860
我们就能依我们的设想重建这个国家
we'll rebuild this country in our own image.

35:40.920 --> 35:44.190
格雷琴  我希望那时你可以在我身边
And when we do, I want you there beside me, Gretchen.

35:44.260 --> 35:47.220
如我许诺过的  做我的副手
As my number two, like I always promised.

35:47.290 --> 35:49.020
丽莎呢
What about Lisa?

35:49.090 --> 35:52.760
我已经跟你说了
I've already told you.

35:52.820 --> 35:54.890
你才是我的女人
You're my girl.

36:06.220 --> 36:09.220
出来
Come on.

36:12.290 --> 36:14.690
去那边
Over there.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.360
就站那儿
Right up there.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.860
你和我都是同一类人
You and I are the same,

36:36.920 --> 36:38.990
阿历克斯
Alex.

36:39.060 --> 36:40.920
我做过的事
I've done things...

37:01.090 --> 37:02.390
用力推
Push!

37:02.460 --> 37:04.560
继续推  继续
Keep going, keep going!

37:07.190 --> 37:09.420
继续推  继续
Keep going! Keep going!

37:09.490 --> 37:11.020
很好  就这样
Yeah, it's good right there.

37:11.090 --> 37:11.860
够到了吗
You got it?

37:11.920 --> 37:13.190
就这样
That's it.

37:13.260 --> 37:14.960
我不知道这个能撑多久
I don't know how long that's going to hold.

37:20.790 --> 37:22.960
我们只要把这个拉过去就行了
All we got to do is pull this thing through.

37:23.020 --> 37:25.360
大家用力推
Oh, guys, push!

37:28.260 --> 37:29.490
断了
Oh! It broke!

37:29.490 --> 37:31.080
木桩断了
The brace is broke!

37:42.560 --> 37:45.620
怀特先生
Mr. White...

37:45.690 --> 37:48.390
很抱歉打扰你  我和莫拉侦探谈过后
I'm sorry to bother you, but, uh, after my talk

37:48.460 --> 37:50.890
我一直在想布劳努先生
with Detective Mara, I was thinking about Mr. Blauner

37:50.960 --> 37:53.520
和我之间的谈话
and some of the conversations we had.

37:53.590 --> 37:55.560
推销员和渔夫很相似  不是吗
Salesmen are a lot like fishermen, right?

37:55.620 --> 37:57.260
总是对自己的业绩夸夸其谈
Always bragging about their big catch.

37:58.420 --> 38:01.860
但安迪却闭口不提他的业绩
Well, Andy never talked about his sales,

38:01.920 --> 38:03.890
无论我如何旁敲侧击
No matter how much I pried.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.490
所以我擅自查了一下
So I took the liberty of... looking them up.

38:10.060 --> 38:13.290
表面  至少存在一些
And there were, to say the least...

38:13.360 --> 38:17.190
不正常数据
irregularities.

38:18.790 --> 38:20.590
安迪  下午好
Good afternoon to you, too, Andy.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.590
你的2个大客户没有
Two of your top buyers don't have valid

38:22.660 --> 38:23.960
合法社保号
Social Security numbers.

38:24.020 --> 38:26.590
我查了那个他所谓的
I checked out the Social Security numbers

38:26.660 --> 38:29.920
伽特工厂买主的社保号
of the clients he allegedly sold GATE workshops to.

38:29.990 --> 38:33.290
有些纯粹是捏造的
In some cases the numbers are just pure fabrications.

38:33.360 --> 38:36.120
但账务必须清算啊
But the checks must've cleared.

38:36.190 --> 38:39.020
他之前肯定在洗钱
He's must've been money laundering for God only knows

38:39.090 --> 38:40.560
天晓得用什么勾当
what kind of criminal exploits.

38:40.620 --> 38:42.960
关键是
The point is...

38:43.020 --> 38:46.260
如果那个执法长官拿到这份报告
if the good officer gets his hands on these papers, you know

38:46.320 --> 38:49.290
你估计就得去见国税核对员了
you're going to be up to your eyeballs in IRS auditors.

38:50.590 --> 38:53.990
我建议你跟莫拉先生说
I suggest you go tell Mr. Mara

38:54.060 --> 38:58.060
你发现布劳努的帐有问题
that you found some irregularities in Blauner's expenses.

38:58.120 --> 39:01.620
注销了私人物品  等等
Writing off personal matters, et cetera.

39:01.690 --> 39:04.690
这就能解释他为会消失
This will explain why he disappeared

39:04.760 --> 39:06.920
也可以息事宁人
and will placate the po-po.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.460
好吧
Okay.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.490
听着  侦探
Listen, Detective...

39:20.390 --> 39:22.820
把它抬起来
Pick it up! Pick it up!

39:22.890 --> 39:24.190
抬不起来  太重了
I can't, it's too heavy!

39:25.220 --> 39:26.490
支柱肯定是断了
The brace must have snapped.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.190
试试把它抬起来
Let's try and get it up!

39:29.720 --> 39:31.020
根本动不了
It's not moving!

39:32.220 --> 39:33.420
水来了
The water's coming.

39:33.490 --> 39:35.860
水来了  出来
The water's coming! Come on!

39:36.920 --> 39:39.290
我们只能把它留在那了
We got to leave it there.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.260
这样就再也拿不到"锡拉"了
But then we'll never get Scylla.

39:41.320 --> 39:44.490
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.460
你没有  我有
You don't, I do.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.020
你这是干嘛
What the hell are you doing?!

39:49.190 --> 39:50.660
你这是干嘛
What the hell are you doing?!

39:50.720 --> 39:53.690
布拉德  别这样  布拉德
Brad, don't do this! Brad!

39:58.060 --> 39:59.890
抓住它  快
Grab it, grab it, now!

39:59.960 --> 40:01.160
水来了
The water's coming!

40:01.220 --> 40:02.460
出来吧  快
Get your ass up here, now!

40:03.520 --> 40:05.890
加把劲
Come on, come on!

40:06.960 --> 40:09.220
你听到没有
You hear that?

40:11.220 --> 40:12.660
他们往管子里注水了
They're flooding the pipe.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.990
林肯  快出来
Linc! Get out of there!

40:15.060 --> 40:17.090
太吵了  他听不到
It's too loud, he can't hear you!

40:17.160 --> 40:18.090
林肯
Linc!

40:19.520 --> 40:21.060
快点儿  你现在还能
Come on, man, there's still enough room

40:21.120 --> 40:22.190
从洞里钻出来
for you to get through the hole.

40:22.260 --> 40:24.060
我一放手你会抓不住的
I let go of this you could drop it.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.060
它太重了
It's too heavy!

40:26.690 --> 40:29.360
布拉德  放下管子
Brad, drop the sleeve

40:29.420 --> 40:30.760
赶快出来
and get out of there!

40:32.890 --> 40:34.420
别这么做
Don't do this.

40:34.490 --> 40:35.920
你还有个儿子
You have a son!

40:35.990 --> 40:38.760
别这么做  别这么做
Don't do this. Don't do this!

40:38.820 --> 40:40.910
推  推吧  斯科菲尔德
Push it! Push it, Scofield!

40:40.910 --> 40:42.780
快点  推过去
Come on,push it through!

40:47.620 --> 40:48.760
推
Push!

40:48.820 --> 40:50.160
推啊
Push it!

40:53.390 --> 40:56.990
快推
Push it! Push it!

40:57.060 --> 40:59.760
布拉德  布拉德  不
Brad! Brad, no!

41:00.890 --> 41:02.990
布拉德
Brad!

41:03.060 --> 41:04.420
布拉德  不
Brad, no!

41:05.460 --> 41:08.760
布拉德
Brad! Brad!

41:10.490 --> 41:11.960
布拉德
Brad!

41:12.790 --> 41:15.760
布拉德  不
Brad, no!

41:15.820 --> 41:18.720
布拉德
Brad! Brad!

41:50.390 --> 41:53.090
你们可以进来了
You can all come back in now.

41:53.160 --> 41:55.190
一切正常
Everything's fine.

41:55.260 --> 41:56.790
一向如此
It always was.

41:56.860 --> 41:58.460
你还好吧
You're okay?

41:58.520 --> 42:00.120
再好不过
Couldn't be better.

42:00.190 --> 42:02.390
更重要的是  "锡拉"怎么样了
More important: what's happening with Scylla?

42:02.460 --> 42:04.060
我会私下告诉你
I'll tell you in private.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.220
你可以当着格雷琴的面告诉我
You can tell me in front of Gretchen.

42:08.660 --> 42:11.460
等我说完一些话再说
Not until I say something else.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.860
你要是再拿着枪靠近他
If you ever come near him with a gun again...

42:13.920 --> 42:15.190
你会怎样
You'll what?

42:16.890 --> 42:18.420
够了
That will do.

42:21.420 --> 42:23.090
"锡拉"
Scylla.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.760
我们安排保安就位的情况
We got preliminary safeguards in place

42:25.820 --> 42:28.290
比预期的快
faster than we expected.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.160
如果需要  我们明天就能转移"锡拉"
We could move Scylla tomorrow if we wanted,

42:30.220 --> 42:33.790
但现在怀特已经除掉了斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
but now that Wyatt's eliminated Scofield and Burrows,

42:33.860 --> 42:35.320
也就没必要了
there's no need.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.360
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯死了
Scofield and Burrows are dead?

42:38.420 --> 42:40.620
死了
Dead as Latin.

42:40.690 --> 42:43.090
按原计划进行
Go ahead with the plan.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.120
如果几个伊州小子
If a couple of boys from Illinois

42:45.190 --> 42:47.460
都能这么接近  那就该重新布局了
could get that close, it's time to mix things up.

42:47.520 --> 42:52.520
我要"锡拉"明天之内移出洛城
I want Scylla out of Los Angeles by the end of the day tomorrow.

43:04.060 --> 43:05.220
他不肯爬上来
He wouldn't climb up.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.290
他就是不肯爬上来
He just wouldn't climb up.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.320
南边的管子通到哪儿
Where does the south pipe lead to?

43:13.390 --> 43:15.390
-或者我们可以沿着它  -不
Maybe we can follow... No.

43:16.420 --> 43:18.890
不  他死了
No, he's gone.
