00:25.300 --> 00:28.560
根本没有和司法部长的会面  对吧
There is no meeting with the attorney general, is there?

00:28.630 --> 00:29.700
他病了  林肯
He's sick, Lincoln.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.560
就算他们没杀他
If they haven't killed him already...

00:31.630 --> 00:33.230
我们一定会把他救回来  我保证
We'll get him back, I promise.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.860
迈克尔需要手术来去除他
Michael needs an operation to remove a tumor

00:35.930 --> 00:37.260
颞叶上的肿瘤
from his temporal lobe.

00:37.330 --> 00:40.000
条件是  你要把"锡拉"安全找回来
The price of the operation is the safe return of Scylla.

00:40.060 --> 00:41.060

额外奖励

00:48.130 --> 00:49.860

00:49.930 --> 00:51.500
迈克尔在哪里

迈克尔需要做手术  也会进行

00:53.730 --> 00:55.000

Where?

00:55.060 --> 00:57.560
-这里  -什么
Here. What?

00:57.630 --> 01:00.160
克兰兹已经安排了世上最好的医生
Krantz has arranged for the best doctors in the world.

01:00.230 --> 01:01.830
我们不能让他们靠近他

01:01.900 --> 01:03.100
我们没时间了
We're out of time.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.400
这是我们唯一的选择
It's our last option.

01:05.460 --> 01:08.830
我不明白为什么"公司"要帮他
I don't understand why the Company would help him.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.230
唐克雷蒂医生  欢迎
Dr. Tancredi, welcome.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.100

01:12.160 --> 01:14.030
没什么好害怕的

01:14.100 --> 01:15.930
我们只想帮助你们
All we want is to help.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.760
你会救迈克尔吗
You're going to save Michael?

01:17.830 --> 01:19.600
你怀疑我们的能力
You question our capabilities?

01:19.660 --> 01:21.600
不  我怀疑你的目的
No. I'm questioning your motives.

01:21.660 --> 01:24.430
当一个人正遭受痛苦的折磨
When a fellow human being is suffering,

01:24.500 --> 01:27.230
我们为什么不能帮他一把
why would we not want to lend a hand?

01:27.300 --> 01:29.100
同情  莎拉
Empathy, Sara,

01:29.160 --> 01:32.400
这就是我们和野兽不同的地方
it's the only thing that separates us from the beasts.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.300
手术进行的同时
For the duration of the surgery,

01:34.360 --> 01:37.430
你就是我的客人
you'll be treated as a guest in my home.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.900

01:39.960 --> 01:42.930
长官  病人准备好了

01:44.330 --> 01:46.400

Mr. Scofield, although you're going to be anesthetized

02:00.660 --> 02:04.060
而且不会感到任何明显的疼痛
and should feel no significant pain, we will need to keep

02:04.130 --> 02:06.500
但是  我们需要你在手术中保持清醒
you awake for the duration of the procedure.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.100
为安全起见  我们需要一直监视
As a safety precaution, we'll need to continually monitor

02:09.160 --> 02:13.060
你的语言和感知能力  这样才能确定
your speech and sensory activity to insure the tissue

02:13.130 --> 02:17.160
病体被去除的同时  不会给你带来任何后遗症
being removed will not leave you impaired in any way.

02:17.230 --> 02:19.130
这是什么医院
What hospital is this?

02:19.200 --> 02:21.460
不用担心  这有最好的医生
Don't worry about it. You've got some good doctors

02:21.530 --> 02:24.300

02:29.230 --> 02:30.530
现在不行
Not now.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.330
林肯在哪
Where's Linc?

02:32.400 --> 02:34.160
他也在这
He's here.

02:34.230 --> 02:36.060
他很好
He's just fine.

02:36.130 --> 02:39.260
迈克尔手术完成前  我是不会离开的
I'm not leaving until Michael has his surgery.

02:39.330 --> 02:41.230
如果你不履行我们之间的承诺
And I'm not starting surgery until you prove

02:41.300 --> 02:43.500
我是不会让他们给迈克尔动手术的
you can hold up your end of the deal.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.100
我们说话之际  "锡拉"就离我们越来越远了
Scylla's slipping through our fingers as we speak.

02:47.160 --> 02:50.960
我们和你弟弟都没有时间了
Time is not on our side, nor on your brother's.

02:51.030 --> 02:53.000
你能从我这里
Now, you'll get full cooperation

02:53.060 --> 02:54.800
得到全力支持
from my office.

02:54.860 --> 02:56.930
需要什么帮助  就打这个号码
If you need anything, just call this number.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.960
我要所有关于赛尔夫和格雷琴的信息
I'm gonna need everything you've got on Self and Gretchen.

03:00.030 --> 03:02.260
化名  所有信息
Aliases, whatever you got.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.360
共犯如何
How about an accomplice?

03:14.260 --> 03:16.000
如果你想要
Now, if you're gonna want...

03:16.060 --> 03:17.200
闭嘴
Shut up.

03:17.260 --> 03:18.460
如果你告诉我他们在那里
You can save yourself a lot of pain

03:18.530 --> 03:20.460
你就可以不用受苦
and the embarrassment of begging me to stop

03:20.530 --> 03:22.230
也不用到时求我住手
if you just tell me where they are.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.630
格雷琴和叛徒特工
Gretchen and Agent Turncoat?

03:24.700 --> 03:25.830
是的
Yeah.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.700
这样的情报
Information like that seems like it could be

03:27.760 --> 03:29.730
可是有一定价值的
of a certain intrinsic value.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.530
如果你能答应
If there were offers made,

03:31.600 --> 03:34.630
给我点好处  我认为
carrots dangled, I could see...

03:34.700 --> 03:37.430
我觉得我应该拿点好处
Look, I deserve some kind of something here,

03:37.500 --> 03:39.160
毕竟  我也付出不少心血
all the work I put in.

03:39.230 --> 03:42.260
如果不是我找到惠斯勒的书
If it wasn't for me finding Whistler's bird book then...

03:44.830 --> 03:47.530
你只配给你个机会
The only thing you deserve is the opportunity

03:47.600 --> 03:49.360
保全你的牙齿和手指甲
to keep your teeth and fingernails.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.330
不  你
No. You...

03:50.400 --> 03:52.400
我不会告诉你任何事情
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.930
我会把你的牙齿一颗颗拔出来
I'm gonna pull out every single tooth, every single one.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.230
怎么样
How about it?

03:59.300 --> 04:00.500
我刚才只是开玩笑
Look, I was just fooling...

04:00.560 --> 04:02.030
好吧
All right!

04:02.100 --> 04:04.900
阿林顿码头  阿林顿码头
Arlington Pier! Arling... Arlington Pier!

04:04.960 --> 04:07.400
什么时候
When? What time?

04:08.230 --> 04:09.730
三点
Three o'clock.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.800
这是最后一针麻醉药
This is the last of the anesthetic

04:15.860 --> 04:18.230
从现在开始  你应该感觉不到任何疼痛  斯科菲尔德先生
From here on out, you shouldn't feel a thing, Mr. Scofield.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.730
我会一直待在那里
I'm going to be right over there the whole time.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.930
我会一直待在这里
I'll be right in here the whole time.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.100
我们准备好了
We're ready.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.260
我不会离开你的
I'm not going to leave you, okay?

04:33.330 --> 04:35.260
你也不准离开我
Don't you dare leave me.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.500
你们小组用过几次伽玛刀治疗
How many surgeries has your team performed using the gamma knife?

05:01.560 --> 05:03.660
伽玛刀治疗
The gamma knife has

05:03.730 --> 05:06.760
有13%的复发率
a recurrence rate of over 13 percent.

05:06.830 --> 05:09.430
我们用的技术更先进
We'll be using a technique that's more advanced.

《越狱》第四季 第十五集
Prison.Break.S04E15

05:54.730 --> 05:56.530
迈克尔怎么样了
What's going on with Michael?

05:56.600 --> 05:58.200
他们马上要动手术
They're gonna operate.

05:58.260 --> 06:00.060
就这样  他们答应做了
Just like that, they agreed to do that?

06:00.130 --> 06:01.930
我跟他们说迈克尔知道"锡拉"买家是谁
I convinced them Michael knew who was gonna buy Scylla.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.760
我们怎么办
What are we gonna do?

06:03.830 --> 06:05.230
先下手为强
Get our hands on it before they do.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.500
-然后给谁  -我还在想
And give it to who? I'm still working on that.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.830
林肯  我要知道我们要做什么
Linc, I need to know what we're doing.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.800
-我们了结这件事  -真的吗
We finish this! Really?

06:10.860 --> 06:11.960
我倒觉得我们会先完蛋
'Cause it feels like it's finishing us.

06:12.030 --> 06:16.230
你和我  只剩下我们了  兄弟
You, me... we're the only ones left, bro.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.700
再多一天  我们就搞定了
One more day and we're done.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.360
没有你  我做不到
I can't do this without you.

06:38.100 --> 06:39.200
买家来了之后
When the buyer gets here,

06:39.260 --> 06:40.760
由我来谈
why don't you let me do the talking.

06:40.830 --> 06:42.030
为什么
For what?

06:42.100 --> 06:44.130
我策划了整件事情  格雷琴
I engineered this whole thing, Gretchen.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.430
我能自己处理
I can handle my business.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.830
是吗  那你干嘛
Oh, yeah? Why don't you start

06:47.900 --> 06:48.860
不先把你脑门上的汗
by handling that river of nerves

06:48.930 --> 06:51.600
擦干净再说
that's running down your forehead.

06:51.660 --> 06:52.700
你以为这次会更简单吗
Did you think this would be easier?

06:52.760 --> 06:53.860
我想过
I hoped.

06:53.930 --> 06:55.100
但我知道
But I guess I always knew

06:55.160 --> 06:57.030
总会有一大堆尸体出现在面前
it was going to come down to a pile of bodies.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.730
我从不认为你是个杀手
I never pegged you for a killer.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.960
我也从不认为你会是母亲
Yeah, well, I never pegged you for a mom.

07:03.130 --> 07:07.460
你觉得我还能是什么  唐
Is there anything that you'd like to peg me for, Don?

07:07.530 --> 07:11.360
行了  别丢人现眼了
Oh, stop. Okay. Don't embarrass yourself.

07:11.430 --> 07:12.860
对其他人可能有用  但是现在
That may work on everyone else, but right now,

07:12.930 --> 07:15.600
我脑子里只有那1.25亿
the only thing I'm thinking about is that $125 million.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.830
把你的上衣系好  睁大眼睛
So close up your blouse and open your eyes,

07:17.900 --> 07:19.360
因为买家就要来了
because the buyer's on the way.

07:19.430 --> 07:22.630
我可不想他来的时候  我们措手不及
And I don't want any surprises when he gets here.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.160
还要多久
How much longer?

07:33.230 --> 07:35.430
一小时左右  耐心坐着吧
Another hour or so. Just sit tight.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.300
我要上厕所
I need to use the men's room.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.800
好极了
Congratulations.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.000
你以为我想干什么  逃跑
What do you think I'm gonna do, run?

07:41.060 --> 07:42.260
我就是这么想的
That's exactly what I think you're gonna do.

07:42.330 --> 07:44.100
在这你还想让我坐冷板凳吗
You want me to go in the back seat, right here?

07:44.160 --> 07:45.160
你最好能尊重一下
I want you to have a little bit of respect

07:45.230 --> 07:46.500
我的智商  阿历克斯
for my intelligence, Alex.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.660
我尊重你  所以我知道你不会违反
I do, which is why I know you wouldn't violate

07:48.730 --> 07:52.000
法则42-13-72B条  规定了
Code 42-13-72B, which states that an individual

07:52.060 --> 07:53.500
被司法代表押送的个人
being transported by a representative

07:53.560 --> 07:56.230
如果押送时间超过3小时
of the criminal justice system must be afforded the opportunity

07:56.300 --> 07:57.660
必须提供
to relieve himself

07:57.730 --> 07:59.960
上厕所的机会
if the duration of the transport is more than three hours.

08:00.030 --> 08:03.600
我确信有那么长时间了
And I do believe we're creeping up on that time.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.200
好吧  我尽量
All right, I'll see what I can do.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.130
但我也要提醒你一条
But I'm going to remind you of a code.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.500
如果罪犯企图在押送途中逃跑
The one that says if a prisoner attempts escape during transfer,

08:11.560 --> 08:13.600
陪同的特工有权
the accompanying agent has the right to shoot them

08:13.660 --> 08:15.030
在背后开枪射击
through the back of the head.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.530
你确定不想再憋一会吗  阿历克斯
You sure you don't want to hold it, Alex?

08:19.600 --> 08:22.860
我确定
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.600
有任何疼痛或不适吗  斯科菲尔德先生
Any pain or discomfort, Mr. Scofield?

08:30.660 --> 08:32.300
没有
No.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.930
那些针  是起稳定作用的吗
Those needles, they're for... stabilization?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.800
不全是  手术期间  迈克尔大脑皮层的
Not exactly. Throughout the surgery, different portions

08:38.860 --> 08:42.100
不同的区域会受到刺激
of Michael's cerebral cortex will be stimulated,

08:42.160 --> 08:43.830
会触发控制
triggering the areas

08:43.900 --> 08:46.730
听觉  嗅觉  记忆的区域
that control senses like hearing, smell, memory.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.460
这就是为什么
That's why some people,

08:48.530 --> 08:50.460
有些人在死之前  经常会说
right before death, often speak of...

08:50.530 --> 08:51.730
人生在眼前一闪而过
Their life flashing before their eyes.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.200
正是
Exactly.

08:54.260 --> 08:56.230
如果大脑缺氧的话
When oxygen is cut off to the brain,

08:56.300 --> 08:58.860
会过度工作  寻找所有资源
it kicks into overdrive, tapping into every resource

08:58.930 --> 09:01.000
以维持身体运作
to continue operating the body.

09:01.060 --> 09:04.660
结果就是  所有感官同时打开
As a result, all of the senses fire off at once.

09:04.730 --> 09:08.900
所有你曾了解  感受  相信过的东西
Everything you've ever known, felt, believed...

09:08.960 --> 09:12.260
都会从眼前闪过
it all passes in a blink of an eye.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.000
你好  迈克尔
Hello Michael

10:00.200 --> 10:01.330
查尔斯
Charles?

10:01.400 --> 10:06.270
我觉得  你现在可以叫我DB了
I guess you can probably call me DB now.

10:13.170 --> 10:15.000
答案是否定的
The answer is no.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.370
答案
The answer?

10:16.430 --> 10:18.400
你在想  你是不是死了
You're wondering if you're dead.

10:18.470 --> 10:20.170
答案是否定的
The answer is no.

10:20.230 --> 10:23.400
那我为什么在这里
Then why am I here?

10:23.470 --> 10:25.700
我相信这是
I believe that's a question

10:25.770 --> 10:28.730
我们都需要寻找的答案
we all need to find the answer to.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.230
看来这是执法史上
This is officially now the most secure bathroom break

10:40.300 --> 10:41.670
最安全的解手时间了
in the history of law enforcement.

10:41.730 --> 10:43.130
确实如此
Yes, it is.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.630
如果你想拷我  堵住所有出口
Hey, look, if you want to cuff me, block off all the exits,

10:45.700 --> 10:47.800
就赶快  如果这样能让你开心的话
take it out and give it a tap, if it makes you happy.

10:47.870 --> 10:50.100
你会开心吗  阿历克斯
Would that make you feel happy, Alex?

10:50.170 --> 10:52.170
我听说监狱能改变人
I hear prison can change a man.

10:52.230 --> 10:54.600
我们能不能赶快做正事
Can we just get this over with.

11:01.670 --> 11:02.670
安全
All clear.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.530
给你15秒
You have 15 seconds.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.590
还行吧
Wasn't so bad now, was it?

11:37.230 --> 11:39.500
你应该相信我
You should've trusted me,

11:39.570 --> 11:42.770
就像我相信你一样
like I trusted you.

11:56.230 --> 11:57.730
好了
All right.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.930
我们可以开始隔离肿瘤了  斯科菲尔德先生
We're ready to begin to isolate the tumor now, Mr. Scofield.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.870
就像我们说过的
As we talked about,

12:03.930 --> 12:06.670
我要你慢慢地背诵字母
I'm going to ask you to slowly recite the alphabet.

12:06.730 --> 12:09.300
如果你想不起字母
If you have any trouble finding a letter,

12:09.370 --> 12:11.830
或说不出字母
any problem saying a letter,

12:11.900 --> 12:14.130
就告诉我们  好吗
you let us know. All right?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.300
好的
All right.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.200
好的
Okay.

12:25.270 --> 12:27.470
准备好了吗
Ready?

12:27.530 --> 12:28.930
开始
And begin.

12:46.170 --> 12:47.630
对不起  查尔斯
I'm sorry, Charles.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.830
为什么
For what?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.700
一切
For everything.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.800
我所说过的谎言
For all the lies I told.

12:52.870 --> 12:55.430
我所造成的痛苦
For all the pain I caused.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.270
你是在寻求我的宽恕吗
Are you asking for forgiveness?

12:58.330 --> 13:00.670
我觉得我不配得到宽恕
I'm not sure I'm entitled to it.

13:03.230 --> 13:07.030
我觉得这由不得
I guess that's for a power

13:07.100 --> 13:09.330
我们决定  不是吗
higher than us to decide, isn't it?

13:14.530 --> 13:19.430
我只是无法相信  我们输了
It's just hard... hard to believe we've lost,

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
一切都白费了
that it was all for nothing.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.100
可以不必这样
It doesn't have to be.

13:40.870 --> 13:42.300
看来
It looks like

13:42.370 --> 13:44.300
肿瘤长到海马体后面了
the tumor is nestled behind the hippocampus.

13:48.070 --> 13:50.000
你知道答案  迈克尔
You have the answers, Michael.

13:50.070 --> 13:52.170
问题是什么
What are the questions?

13:53.330 --> 13:56.100
我不知道  但你知道
I don't know, but you do.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.570
你只是还没有意识到
You just haven't realized it yet.

14:08.830 --> 14:09.930
前面右转
Up here, make a right.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.570
不  左转
No, no, left, left, left.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.770
我们还有10分钟  你觉得呢
We got ten minutes, what do you think?

14:15.830 --> 14:16.930
有点紧
It's gonna be tight.

14:20.830 --> 14:22.530
他们随时会来
All right, any minute now.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.230
没看到他
There's no sign of him.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.470
查一下怀肯的掌上电脑
Check Vikan's PDA.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.800
看看买家有没有留消息
See if the buyer left him a message.

14:28.870 --> 14:30.130
这个东西坏了
Oh, this thing is broken.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.500
肯定是他摔倒时砸坏了
It must have cracked when he hit the ground.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.270
还能看见号码吗
Can you still see the contact number?

14:34.330 --> 14:35.630
可以  是迈阿密的区号
Yeah, it's a Miami area code.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.530
读一下  我记到我手机里
Okay, read it out. I'll put it in mine.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.000
不  我不会读给你的
No, no, I'm not reading out anything.

14:39.070 --> 14:40.100
我暂时保留这个号码
I'm gonna keep that number

14:40.170 --> 14:41.530
你不介意的话
for now, if you don't mind.

14:42.630 --> 14:43.630
是谁
Who is it?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.100
我姐姐
It's my sister.

14:45.170 --> 14:46.870
不许接
Don't answer it.

14:46.930 --> 14:48.470
我说了不许接
I said don't answer it.

14:49.530 --> 14:50.800
开枪吧
Shoot me.

14:53.270 --> 14:54.570
喂
Hello?

14:54.630 --> 14:55.570
我们自由了
We're free.

14:55.630 --> 14:56.570
他走了
He's gone.

14:56.630 --> 14:57.570
什么
What?

14:57.630 --> 14:59.000
那个
The... the guy

14:59.070 --> 15:00.970
有只假手的人  他放了我们
with the, uh, fake hand... he let us go,

15:01.030 --> 15:04.000
所以我们穿过街  跑到普特的屋子里
so we, uh... we ran across the street to the Patels' house,

15:04.070 --> 15:05.630
几分钟之后  我往窗外看
and a couple minutes later, I looked out the window,

15:05.700 --> 15:06.630
看到
and I saw these, uh...

15:06.700 --> 15:08.430
两个人
these two guys in, uh...

15:08.500 --> 15:10.100
穿着西服  把他拖进货车了
in these suits, and they, uh, dragged him off

15:10.170 --> 15:12.200
行了  格雷琴  让巴格维尔接电话
into some van. All right, Gretchen, put Bagwell on the phone.

15:12.270 --> 15:13.930
-他不在那  -格雷琴  我可没开玩笑
He's not there. Gretchen, I'm not playing anymore...

15:14.000 --> 15:16.630
唐  "公司"的人抓住他了
Don, the Company took him.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.470
艾米丽怎么样了
How's Emily?

15:24.530 --> 15:25.800
她没事
She's... She's fine.

15:26.830 --> 15:28.500
听着  格雷琴
Listen, Gretchen.

15:28.570 --> 15:31.130
你得离我们远点
You need to stay away from us.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.470
为了所有的人
For everyone's sake.

15:32.530 --> 15:33.970
给  宝贝
Here, baby.

15:34.030 --> 15:36.100
再见  阿姨
Bye, Auntie.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.200
别管巴格维尔那个乡巴佬
Forget that hick, Bagwell.

15:42.270 --> 15:44.270
不  不行
No, I can't.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.900
他知道交易地点
He knows the location of the exchange.

15:46.970 --> 15:49.170
如果他知道我们在这
If he knows we're here...

15:49.230 --> 15:51.130
那么"公司"也知道
then the Company does, too.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.830
那就是
Hey, that's it.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.570
就在那  阿林顿码头
Right there-- Arlington Pier.

16:03.670 --> 16:04.630
靠边停
Pull over.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.370
血  兄弟
Blood, papi.

16:40.430 --> 16:41.930
我们刚刚错过了
We just missed them.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.900
我去附近看看
I'll go look around.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.100
指挥部
Operations.

16:52.170 --> 16:53.900
将军说  如果有需要就打这个电话
The General said to call this number if I needed help.

16:53.970 --> 16:55.730
请说您的通行码
Your clearance code, please.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.430
通行码
Clearance code?

16:57.500 --> 16:59.730
我是林肯·布伦斯  你将失去"锡拉"如何
How about I'm Lincoln Burrows and you're about to lose Scylla?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.500
通过
Proceed.

17:02.570 --> 17:04.030
我要追踪这条线
I need to trace this line.

17:04.100 --> 17:05.170
我们试过了
We've already tried.

17:05.230 --> 17:06.400
你所在的区域
You're in a zone

17:06.470 --> 17:07.730
无法进行视频监控
where visual surveillance is an impossibility.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.000
那就在区域外
Well, how about you look

17:09.070 --> 17:10.970
查找过去15分钟内
outside the zone and check for a vehicle leaving

17:11.030 --> 17:12.270
离开的车辆
in the last 15 minutes.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.430
如果有  核对一下  再给我电话
If you see one, get a match and call me.

17:16.630 --> 17:17.700
没发现
Nothing.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.170
没有痕迹  不过我找到这些
No tracks, but I found these.

17:19.230 --> 17:21.230
他们知道我们在找他们
They know we're onto them.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.100
我们要在他们分开前找到他们
We got to find these people before they split.

17:37.770 --> 17:39.900
有人在  但不是卖方
Someone's here, but it's not the seller.

17:39.970 --> 17:42.270
我该怎么做
What do you want me to do?

17:52.100 --> 17:53.830
我只是很好奇  朗格
I'm just curious, Lang.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.230
你什么时候决定背叛我的
When did you decide to turn your back on me?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.030
估计在你决定
Probably about the same time

17:58.100 --> 17:59.330
变成逃犯的同时吧
you decided to become a fugitive.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.200
我没跟你说话
I wasn't talking to you.

18:01.270 --> 18:03.170
我立过誓要维护法律  阿历克斯
I took an oath to uphold the law, Alex.

18:03.230 --> 18:04.700
为了升职吗
Did you do it for a promotion?

18:04.770 --> 18:07.130
为了抓我  他们答应你什么了
Did they promise you anything to serve me up?

18:07.200 --> 18:10.230
我只想让你安全  阿历克斯
The only thing I ever wanted was your safety, Alex.

18:12.030 --> 18:13.330
你逃跑时间越长
The longer you're on the run,

18:13.400 --> 18:15.700
我实现目标的机会就越少
the lower my chance of getting what I want.

18:22.870 --> 18:24.730
你往外看什么  阿历克斯
What you looking for out there, Alex?

18:26.570 --> 18:28.070
那里
There.

18:37.830 --> 18:39.770
我是惠勒特工  有个嫌疑犯
Agent Wheeler. I've got a suspect

18:39.830 --> 18:41.600
在拘禁期间逃跑
fleeing custody off Route 14

18:41.670 --> 18:43.000
格林伯格以南3公里14号公路
about three miles north of Greenburg.

18:43.070 --> 18:44.400
请求空中支援
Requesting backup and air support.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.900
我不是有意吓你
I didn't mean to startle you.

18:59.970 --> 19:01.700
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

19:01.770 --> 19:03.430
客户服务
Customer service.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.070
质量控制
Quality control.

19:05.130 --> 19:08.800
我希望能掌控一切
I like to keep a hand in all our theaters of engagement.

19:08.870 --> 19:10.770
说得就像个军人
Spoken like a military man.

19:10.830 --> 19:14.800
把人命看得跟演戏一样简单
So easy to discuss lives in the balance when it's just theater.

19:14.870 --> 19:16.930
我很欣赏你的忠诚  莎拉
I admire your devotion, Sara.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.470
我最看重这个
It's an attribute I value above all others,

19:20.530 --> 19:22.370
但我想知道
but I wonder...

19:22.430 --> 19:23.970
你忠诚的是信仰
is it the cause

19:24.030 --> 19:26.430
还是这个人
you believe in or the man?

19:26.500 --> 19:30.130
我是说  你是个空想家呢
I mean, are you an ideologue

19:30.200 --> 19:35.400
或者只是个难得有人垂青就死缠烂打
or just a silly schoolgirl following the brooding boy

19:35.470 --> 19:36.600
的傻女学生
who finally noticed her?

19:36.670 --> 19:38.130
我是个寻找
I'm the girl whose father was murdered,

19:38.200 --> 19:40.230
谋杀我父亲的混蛋的女生
who's looking for the bastard responsible.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.500
你希望我打几个电话
Would you like me to make a few phone calls,

19:42.570 --> 19:44.170
看能否帮你
see if I can point you

19:44.230 --> 19:45.900
指点迷津
in the right direction?

19:45.970 --> 19:48.600
你放心  他接受的
You can relax, he's receiving

19:48.670 --> 19:49.730
是最好的治疗
the best possible care.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.000
是吗
Is he?

19:51.070 --> 19:52.700
因为我从没看到这种仪器
Because I've never seen this equipment before,

19:52.770 --> 19:54.470
也从没见过这种方式
and I've never seen this procedure.

19:54.530 --> 19:55.830
这是实验性的  对吗
It's experimental, isn't it?

19:55.900 --> 19:58.270
可以这么说  但以前用过一次
Well, you could say that, but it has been used once before.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.900
那个病人活了多久
How long did the patient live?

19:59.970 --> 20:02.230
唐克雷蒂医生
Dr. Tancredi,

20:02.300 --> 20:06.100
我知道你怎么看我们的做法  但是记住
I know your opinion of the work we do here, but know this.

20:06.170 --> 20:09.170
要看事情的本质
Not everything is as it seems.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.800
而且  这个手术
And for what it's worth,

20:11.870 --> 20:15.500
让那个病人过得很好  很久
the patient lived a long, happy life.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.670
你在干什么
What are you doing?

20:33.730 --> 20:36.770
结构工程师的责任是
It is the job of a structural engineer

20:36.830 --> 20:38.930
让他所有创造的东西
to make sure everything he creates is designed

20:39.000 --> 20:41.930
能承受附加在上面的重量
to withstand the weight placed upon it.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.470
我在这建造的
What I've built here...

20:44.530 --> 20:46.570
不够牢固
does not hold up.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.800
如果你发现
If you discovered

20:48.870 --> 20:51.700
你建造的东西有缺陷
that a structure you built was deficient,

20:51.770 --> 20:54.830
你会拆了它
would you tear down the building

20:54.900 --> 20:56.800
还是设法修整它
or find a way to fix it?

20:56.870 --> 21:00.170
我试过修整
I've tried to fix it.

21:00.230 --> 21:03.770
我试过让事情按部就班
I've tried to make things right.

21:03.830 --> 21:07.970
但我做的只是加大重量
All I've done is add more weight to it.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.430
现在
And now...

21:11.500 --> 21:13.900
我也承受不住了
...now I can't take anymore.

21:16.630 --> 21:19.930
我想做的只是救我哥哥
All I wanted to do was save my brother's life.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.900
你做到了吗
Did you do that?

21:21.970 --> 21:24.030
是的
Yes...

21:24.100 --> 21:25.930
但是有多少人
but how many other people

21:26.000 --> 21:28.330
为了这件事而失去生命
lost their lives in the process?

21:28.400 --> 21:30.770
现在知道了
Knowing that now,

21:30.830 --> 21:32.530
你还会让他死吗
would you have let him die?

21:32.600 --> 21:35.000
不会
No.

21:35.070 --> 21:38.870
因此你觉得自己是个杀人凶手吗
And that makes you feel like some kind of murderer?

21:42.070 --> 21:43.530
可能吧
Perhaps.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.200
杀十个人  你是个连环杀手
Take ten lives, you're a serial killer.

21:47.270 --> 21:49.230
杀一千个人  你就是战争英雄
Take thousands, you're a war hero.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.700
这不是战争
This isn't war.

21:50.770 --> 21:52.400
你确定吗
Are you sure?

21:52.470 --> 21:55.070
只不过是"公司"的小黑名单而已
There's nothing more than the Company's little black book.

21:55.130 --> 21:58.870
名字  数字  行动报告
Names, numbers, operation reports.

21:58.930 --> 22:02.570
事情不能只看表面  迈克尔
Not everything is as it seems, Michael.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.200
但你知道
But you know that...

22:06.270 --> 22:07.730
不是吗
don't you?

22:20.800 --> 22:22.670
好了  我们得和买家
All right, look, we need to reestablish contact

22:22.730 --> 22:24.730
重新取得联系  告诉他发生了什么事
with the buyer, explain to him what happened,

22:24.800 --> 22:25.900
重新选个交易地点
and then set a new location for the exchange.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.600
我得说
I got to say...

22:28.670 --> 22:29.900
我很惊讶  唐
I'm amazed at you, Don.

22:29.970 --> 22:32.170
那么长时间  你从没想过了解
Yeah, all this time, and you never once asked to see

22:32.230 --> 22:34.300
-"锡拉"里的信息  -因为我不在乎信息
the information in Scylla. That's 'cause I don't care

22:34.370 --> 22:36.130
我只关心它的价值
about the information; I just care what it's worth.

22:36.200 --> 22:39.470
也许你担心  要是知道里面的信息后
Maybe you're just worried if you actually knew what was on it,

22:39.530 --> 22:42.370
你会想  买家是什么样的人
you'd have second thoughts about who you're selling it to.

22:56.030 --> 22:57.430
喂
Hello?

22:57.500 --> 22:59.700
布伦斯先生  我们有目标的情况
Mr. Burrows, we have a hit on the targets.

22:59.770 --> 23:01.600
路况监视器显示他们进了一家便利店
Traffic camera picked them up entering a convenience store

23:01.670 --> 23:02.870
在威利街14号
on Valley and 14th.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.300
看来他们留下蛛丝马迹了
Looks like they left a footprint.

23:43.670 --> 23:45.200
不许动
Don't move.

23:48.730 --> 23:50.800
干得不错  朗格特工
That's a hell of a job, Agent Lang.

23:50.870 --> 23:52.530
是你教我如何看穿
You're the one who taught me how to read the mind

23:52.600 --> 23:53.730
逃犯的思想  记得吗
of a convict on the run, remember?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.700
如果你把我带走  我就是死路一条
If you take me in, I'm as good as dead.

23:55.770 --> 23:56.700
你知道的
You know that.

23:56.770 --> 23:59.130
所以
So...

23:59.200 --> 24:01.170
我现在要逃走了
I'm gonna run now.

24:01.230 --> 24:02.930
如果你要阻拦我
And if you need to stop me,

24:03.000 --> 24:04.370
你就必须杀掉我
you're gonna have to shoot.

24:04.430 --> 24:06.170
别逼我
Don't make me do this.

24:06.230 --> 24:07.970
对不起
I'm sorry.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.930
他时他方再见  费丽舍
Another time, another place, eh, Felicia?

24:13.000 --> 24:15.700
我会扣下扳机
I will pull this trigger.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.030
发生什么了
What happened?

24:34.100 --> 24:36.030
他跑了
He got away.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.300
你看到他了吗
Did you have him?

24:37.360 --> 24:39.300
我
Uh, yeah, I...

24:39.360 --> 24:42.030
我以为看到他了
I thought I had him unless I...

24:42.100 --> 24:43.530
但是跟丢了
I just missed.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.830
你看到他往哪跑了吗
Did you see which way he went?

24:44.900 --> 24:46.200
还是连这个也跟丢了
Or did you just miss that, too?

24:47.300 --> 24:49.030
他朝东去了
He went east.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.460
-伙计  -怎么了
Hey, buddy. What's up?

25:04.530 --> 25:07.530
我在找一名高个黑色头发的女人
I'm looking for a, a tall chick with black hair

25:07.600 --> 25:09.700
一个男人  高个
and a guy-- tall guy, uh...

25:09.760 --> 25:11.400
看上去就像波仔小丑
He looks like Bozo the clown.

25:11.460 --> 25:12.660
你知道波仔和埃尔韦拉吗
You know, Bozo and Elvira?

25:12.730 --> 25:14.830
你们
You guys

25:14.900 --> 25:16.260
是警察还是什么
cops or somethin'?

25:16.330 --> 25:18.360
不是
Not even close.

25:20.660 --> 25:22.230
有印象吗
So how 'bout it?

25:23.900 --> 25:25.530
我不记得见过这些人
I don't remember anyone like that.

25:27.260 --> 25:29.130
现在呢  臭小子
How 'bout now, you punk?

25:29.200 --> 25:30.460
-现在呢  -好的  我说
-How 'bout now?! -Okay! Okay!

25:30.530 --> 25:31.800
他们买了个手机
They bought a phone, man.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.030
给我收据
I want the receipt.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.060
好的
All right.

25:41.730 --> 25:43.660
他们在路上
On their way.

25:43.730 --> 25:45.400
你知道买家是谁吗
You have any idea who the buyer is?

25:45.460 --> 25:46.960
不知道  也永远不会知道
No. And we never will.

25:47.030 --> 25:49.130
任何想盗取"锡拉"里的信息的人
Whoever's walking away with the information that's on Scylla

25:49.200 --> 25:50.460
都会不惜一切
will do whatever it takes

25:50.530 --> 25:52.460
避开公司的雷达
to stay below The Company radar.

25:52.530 --> 25:54.460
而且  你要是搞了别人的老婆
Besides, would you screw some guy's wife

25:54.530 --> 25:56.100
会把名片放在他的枕头上吗
and then leave your card on his pillow?

25:56.160 --> 25:59.100
你不就是这么对将军的嘛
Isn't that what you just did to the General?

25:59.160 --> 26:00.260
说嘛
Come on.

26:00.330 --> 26:01.500
我们经历了这么多
After all we've been through,

26:01.560 --> 26:02.960
就不能互相坦诚吗
we can't be honest with each other?

26:03.030 --> 26:04.430
你的小照片
Your little photo shoot.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.460
还有想偷第6张卡的馊主意
And your weak ass attempt at the sixth card.

26:06.530 --> 26:08.600
你就想让他知道你参与了  对吧
You wanted him to know you were involved, right?

26:08.660 --> 26:10.600
说吧  他惩罚过你
Come on. He punished you,

26:10.660 --> 26:13.060
对待垃圾一样对你  就像你父亲那样
treated you like crap-- just like your real daddy.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.900
你希望至少其中一人付出代价  不是吗
You want at least one of them to pay for it, right?

26:15.960 --> 26:16.900
说吧  格雷琴
Come on, Gretchen.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.060
我了解你
I-I know you.

26:18.130 --> 26:20.460
我查了很多资料
I did my homework.

26:20.530 --> 26:22.730
天啊  唐  你
Gee, Don, you...

26:22.800 --> 26:25.760
你完全挖出了我的恋父情结啊  厉害
you just cracked my whole Electra complex wide open.Kudos.

26:27.860 --> 26:29.800
但并不是只有你一个人查了资料
But you're not the only one who did their homework.

26:29.860 --> 26:31.130
只是想让你知道
Just so you know.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.960
-是吗  你还想说什么  -现在
-Yeah? You got something to say? -Right now,

26:33.030 --> 26:34.760
我们得为即将来临的一切做好准备
we need to be ready for whatever's coming.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.530
你最好眼观六路  唐
You better watch your six, Don.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.560
好的
Okay.

26:41.530 --> 26:43.100
-你找我吗  -是的
-You wanted to see me? -Yeah.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.700
我从显示器上没看明白
I-I can't quite tell from the monitors,

26:44.760 --> 26:47.260
但我觉得那个肿瘤
but from what I can see, the-the growth,

26:47.330 --> 26:49.000
看起来并不只是在下丘脑
it looks like it isn't just on the hypothalamus.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.230
我知道这只是初步诊断
I understand that was the initial diagnosis,

26:53.300 --> 26:56.100
但是进入里面后  发现也扩散到
but once we got in there, it appears to have spread

26:56.160 --> 26:58.100
海马体了
to the hippocampus as well.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.430
好的
Okay. Um,

26:59.500 --> 27:02.300
如果肿瘤切除后  会丧失记忆吗
so with the removal, will there be any memory loss?

27:02.360 --> 27:04.100
像这种情况
Well, in cases like this,

27:04.160 --> 27:06.330
有小部分组织必须移除
where small portions have to be removed,

27:06.400 --> 27:09.400
但基本不会影响到大部分记忆
it hardly ever affects what's referred to as "net memory."

27:09.460 --> 27:12.060
我们将一生的经历
We're all tapped into such small portions

27:12.130 --> 27:14.700
都储存在这一小部分
of what we've experienced in our lifetime.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.200
大部分只是储存在里面
The bulk of it's just kept in storage,

27:17.260 --> 27:19.300
很少被意识所承认
rarely acknowledged by the conscious mind.

27:19.360 --> 27:22.330
所以即使有部分记忆丧失
So while there may be some gross memory loss,

27:22.400 --> 27:23.860
他也不会知道
he won't ever know it's gone.

27:23.930 --> 27:26.030
因为他根本不知道那些记忆的存在
Because he'll never know it was there.

27:54.460 --> 27:55.330
护士
Nurse?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.030
血压在下降  90/60
BP's dropping, 90/60.

27:57.100 --> 27:57.930
怎么回事
What's going on?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.200
我不知道
I don't know.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.430
把多巴胺的输液速度调到12.5
Increase dopamine delivery rate to 12.5.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.660
时机成熟了  我们再用"交易"
We'll use the Bargain when the time is right.

28:07.730 --> 28:08.700
现在就是最好的时机
The time is now.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.700
"交易"  "交易"
Bargain. Bargain.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.500
时机成熟  再用
We'll use time--  time is right.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.100
时机成熟了  我们再用"交易"
We'll use the Bargain when the time is right.

28:18.260 --> 28:21.430
或许现在就是最好的时机
perhaps the time is now.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.960
脑电图达到峰值
EEG's spiking.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.060
大脑活动异常
Brain activity's all over the place.

28:25.130 --> 28:26.600
动脉压值55
MAP's at 55.

28:26.660 --> 28:28.030
血压不稳定  在下降
BP's erratic. Dropping.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.460
85  84
85, 84.

28:29.530 --> 28:31.100
给他注射1毫升阿托品  迈克尔
Give him one mil of Atropine. Michael?

28:31.160 --> 28:32.460
能听见我们说话吗
Are you still with us?

28:32.530 --> 28:35.860
由世上最聪明的人设计出的安全系统
The best minds in the world designed this system,

28:35.930 --> 28:37.060
你几乎把它打破了
and you almost beat it.

28:40.460 --> 28:41.900
但只要我们有
But as long as we have...

28:43.660 --> 28:45.230
但只要我们有
...we have-- as long as we...

28:48.830 --> 28:50.160
你听说
So what are you hearing, uh,

28:50.230 --> 28:51.000
锡拉价值多少
Scylla's worth?

28:51.060 --> 28:53.330
我听说值上百万
Me, I'm hearing millions.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.230
前几天
Things have happened

28:56.300 --> 28:57.600
发生的事
in the past few days that

28:57.660 --> 28:59.130
让我感觉不安
have made me uneasy.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.660
但只要我们有"锡拉"  我们就有"力量"
But as long as we have Scylla,  we have power.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.160
很抱歉  迈克尔
I'm sorry, Michael.

29:10.230 --> 29:12.330
他快不行了  78  急救
We're losing him. 78. Get the crash cart.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.130
-喉镜  得插管  -不
Laryngeal scope. we need to intubate. No.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.500
怎么了
What's going on?

29:15.560 --> 29:16.960
该走了
It's time to go.

29:23.100 --> 29:24.630
迈克尔
Michael?

29:24.700 --> 29:25.460
迈克尔
Michael?!

29:34.400 --> 29:35.470
迈克尔  怎么回事  他怎么会这样
Michael! What's going on? Why's he crashing?

29:35.540 --> 29:36.240
唐克雷蒂小姐  你不能
Ms. Tancredi, you cannot...

29:36.300 --> 29:36.940
没事  没关系
No, it's okay.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.440
迈克尔  别这样
Michael, don't do this.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.070
不要这样
Don't do this.

29:40.140 --> 29:41.100
不要这样
Don't do this.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.140
不要离开
Don't go.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.600
我们还没完成呢
We're not finished with this.

29:43.670 --> 29:44.940
还没完成呢
Not finished yet.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.200
迈克尔  对不起
Michael, I'm sorry.

29:46.270 --> 29:47.240
是时候了
It's time.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.140
求你了  查尔斯
Please, Charles.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.440
迈克尔  别这样
Michael, not like this.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.570
别这样
Not like this.

29:51.640 --> 29:52.840
不能这样
It doesn't happen like this.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.440
你答应过我要一起完成的
You promised me we would finish together.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.100
没关系
It's okay.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.270
你已经完成了你该做的
You've done your part.

29:57.340 --> 29:58.770
我还没弄明白呢
I haven't figured it out yet!

29:58.840 --> 30:00.440
你已经弄明白了
Yes, you have.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.800
你能做点什么吗
Would you do something?

30:01.870 --> 30:03.000
我在努力
I'm trying!

30:11.870 --> 30:13.340
放松点
Relax.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.970
你可能认为这不好
You might think it's bad,

30:16.040 --> 30:17.770
实际上不是的
but it's not.

30:19.800 --> 30:20.800
死亡
Dying?

30:20.870 --> 30:21.740
不是
No!

30:25.170 --> 30:26.600
不要放弃
Don't give up.

30:26.670 --> 30:27.770
不要放弃
Don't give up.

30:27.840 --> 30:28.900
不要放弃
Don't give up.

30:45.870 --> 30:47.400
事情不能只看表面
Not everything is as it seems.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.370
再见  迈克尔
Good-bye, Michael.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.540
查尔斯
Charles.

31:16.070 --> 31:16.840
迈克尔
Michael?

31:17.940 --> 31:19.170
迈克尔  不要离开我
Michael, don't leave me.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.700
你也不准离开我
Don't you dare leave me.

31:28.570 --> 31:30.570
莎拉
Sara.

31:42.740 --> 31:44.640
公司追踪了收据上的序列号
Company tracked the serial code off the receipt.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.600
格雷琴五分钟前打了一个电话
Gretchen just placed a call five minutes ago

31:46.670 --> 31:48.270
-序列号相符  -在哪打的
matching the tracking number. From where?

31:48.340 --> 31:49.370
两英里外
Two miles away.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.970
据我所知  你们应该有三个人
I was told there'd be three of you.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.270
现在没有了
Well there aren't.

31:59.340 --> 32:01.270
你拿了钱吗  那么小的盒子
You have the money? Because that's a small case

32:01.340 --> 32:03.270
-可装不了1.25亿  -我们不用现金交易
for $125 million... We don't deal in cash.

32:03.340 --> 32:06.300
一旦我确定东西是真的
Once I verify the validity of the item,

32:06.370 --> 32:09.800
钱就会打到你提供的账户上
the funds will be wired to an account number you provide.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.170
请把东西拿出来
The item, please.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.300
不行  我看不到钱
No, no, no, you're not gonna see the item

32:20.370 --> 32:22.240
你就不能看东西
until I see the money, okay? You'll have to

32:22.300 --> 32:24.970
恕我不能相信一个有几个按钮的亮盒子
forgive me if I don't trust a shiny case with some buttons.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.270
我要确定数据是否完整
I need to confirm that the data is intact.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.270
不然的话  你手里的东西
Without it, the item you possess

32:30.340 --> 32:33.600
不过也就是个靓盒子
is nothing more than a fancy box.

32:33.670 --> 32:34.670
谈到这点
Speaking of...

32:34.740 --> 32:37.240
把东西给他
Give this man the item.

32:37.300 --> 32:38.740
不  我谁也不给
No, I'm not giving anyone...

32:38.800 --> 32:40.400
他是个商人
This is a businessman

32:40.470 --> 32:42.070
在做商务交易
making a business transaction.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.640
你拖的时间越长
One with the longer you take,

32:44.700 --> 32:47.140
我们就越危险
the more danger you put us all in.

33:03.870 --> 33:05.340
你能读出里面的数据吗
Can you read what's on there?

33:07.440 --> 33:09.470
最好是这样
You better hope so.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.400
他们不会轻易把锡拉给我们的
They're not just gonna give us Scylla.

33:29.470 --> 33:30.540
你应该明白吧
You know what that means, right?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.770
我们分头行动
Let's split up.

33:58.650 --> 34:01.450
看上去不像"公司"的黑名单
That doesn't look like a company's black book.it's...

34:02.760 --> 34:04.630
更像是
It looks more like a...

34:10.900 --> 34:12.000
我确信你们明白
I'm sure you understand

34:12.070 --> 34:14.100
不能让人知道"锡拉"的去向
no one can know where Scylla's going to.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.370
算你走运  甜心
It's your lucky day, sugar.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.440
你可不走运
Not yours.

34:42.100 --> 34:44.240
放下枪
Drop it.

34:44.300 --> 34:45.800
看住她
Cover her.

34:52.970 --> 34:54.400
-他在哪  -我不知道
Where is he? I don't know.

34:54.470 --> 34:55.870
他在哪
Where is he?

34:55.940 --> 34:57.440
-我不知道  -跑了
I don't know!  Gone.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.600
"锡拉"被偷了
Stolen.

34:59.670 --> 35:01.600
谁干的
By who?

35:02.940 --> 35:04.440
谁
By who?

35:04.500 --> 35:07.470
我要是死了  你永远都别想知道
If I die... you'll never know.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.270
你真漂亮
You look beautiful.

35:51.670 --> 35:55.100
撒谎
You're a liar.

35:55.170 --> 35:57.070
怎么样了
How'd it go?

35:57.130 --> 36:00.170
他们还在做一些测试
They're still running some tests,

36:00.230 --> 36:02.770
不过他们确信已经搞定了
but they feel pretty confident they got it all.

36:02.830 --> 36:05.230
这是哪
And what is this place?

36:05.300 --> 36:08.070
你得了解一下你的手术
You need to know something about your surgery.

36:09.770 --> 36:12.170
手术是"公司"的医生做的
It was performed by Company doctors,

36:12.230 --> 36:14.570
将军安排了这一切
and the General made all the arrangements.

36:14.630 --> 36:15.830
为什么
Why?

36:15.930 --> 36:17.300
我不知道
I don't know.

36:17.370 --> 36:19.100
林肯在处理这件事
Lincoln's handling it.

36:19.170 --> 36:20.400
他说他有个计划
He says he has a plan.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.670
说实话  我唯一关心的
I'll be honest. Right now, you're alive,

36:22.730 --> 36:25.070
就是现在你还活着
and that's all I care about.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.930
你肯定会笑的  我做了个有关"锡拉"的梦
You're gonna laugh, but I had a dream about Scylla.

36:32.470 --> 36:35.770
我们了解的只是赛尔夫的片面之词
The only thing we really know about it is what Self told us.

36:35.830 --> 36:37.030
你需要休息
You need to rest.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.800
我是认真的
I'm serious.

36:38.870 --> 36:41.030
如果它不只是"公司"的黑皮书呢
What if it's not just the Company's little black book?

36:41.100 --> 36:42.230
万一是
What if it's...

36:42.300 --> 36:44.430
事情不能只看表面
Not everything is as it seems.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.070
别的什么呢
...something more?

36:47.130 --> 36:48.970
比如
Like what?

36:49.030 --> 36:52.070
一些好的东西
Something good.

36:52.130 --> 36:54.570
为什么要费这么大周折
Why go to so much trouble

36:54.630 --> 36:56.570
保护过去的信息
to protect information about the past,

36:56.630 --> 36:58.930
"公司"随时都可以
information the Company could just delete

36:59.000 --> 37:01.930
删除这些信息
any time they wanted to?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.730
将军说
The General said...

37:03.800 --> 37:06.970
只要我们有"锡拉"  我们就有"力量"
As long as we have Scylla, we have power.

37:07.030 --> 37:10.300
我认为他说的力量
I don't think he was talking about power

37:10.370 --> 37:11.870
并不是控制或影响
like control or influence.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.930
我觉得他说的是能源
I think he was talking about energy.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.970
硼
Boron.

37:16.700 --> 37:19.300
氩
Argon.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.800
镓
Gallium.

37:21.870 --> 37:23.530
铟
Indium.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.000
交易
Bargain.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.070
理论上而言  如果有办法
There's a theory that if you can find a way

37:30.130 --> 37:33.800
把这些元素结合到太阳能电池设计中
to combine these elements into the design of a solar cell,

37:33.870 --> 37:38.830
就能百分之百地利用太阳能
you can harness 100% of the sun's energy.

37:38.900 --> 37:41.600
一旦拥有这种能量
With that kind of power,

37:41.670 --> 37:43.970
没有什么是不可能的
possibilities are limitless.

37:44.030 --> 37:47.300
这就是为什么"锡拉"会受到重重保护
It would certainly explain all the security around Scylla.

37:49.030 --> 37:50.970
他们不是保护过去
They're not protecting the past.

37:51.030 --> 37:52.400
而是为了保护未来
They're protecting the future.

37:54.270 --> 37:56.070
真不知道还有什么
Wonder what else is on it.

37:56.130 --> 37:58.300
我是说  他们为你提供的医疗设备
I mean, the equipment you were treated with,

37:58.370 --> 37:59.870
还有药物
and the drugs they gave you.

37:59.930 --> 38:02.330
都是在公共市场买不到的
none of it exists on the open market.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.430
所以才会有人愿意
Which would explain why some people are willing

38:04.500 --> 38:07.670
支付数百万以获得"锡拉"
to pay hundreds of millions to get their hands on Scylla.

38:07.730 --> 38:09.500
他们不是为了搞垮"公司"
It's not about taking down the Company.

38:09.570 --> 38:10.700
而是
It's about

38:10.770 --> 38:13.030
想成为"公司"
becoming the Company.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.370
他们想了解一切
It's about knowing what they know,

38:15.430 --> 38:17.530
控制一切
controlling what they know.

38:18.970 --> 38:20.370
我们该怎么办
What do we do now?

38:26.230 --> 38:28.170
下一步计划是什么
So, what's the next move?

38:28.230 --> 38:29.570
我先去看迈克尔
I'm gonna check on Michael.

38:29.630 --> 38:31.230
不  我是说  在那之后
No, I mean, after that.

38:31.300 --> 38:32.800
我是说  "锡拉"在某处
I mean, Scylla's out there somewhere.

38:32.870 --> 38:34.630
我们真的要继续寻找它的下落吗
Are we really gonna keep chasing it?

38:34.700 --> 38:36.770
我不知道  以后再说
I don't know. We'll figure it out later.

38:37.830 --> 38:39.870
不
No.

38:39.930 --> 38:41.570
我不会来了  林肯
I won't be here, Linc.

38:43.470 --> 38:45.100
我不能再这么做了
I can't do it anymore.

38:45.170 --> 38:47.070
莎拉说迈克尔已经没事了
Sara said Mike was okay,

38:47.130 --> 38:49.270
我只关心这个问题
and that's all I needed to know.

38:49.330 --> 38:51.900
但是我有自己的生活
But now I got to go live my life.

38:51.970 --> 38:54.800
不用整天看见别人死去
And that's a life where I can go a day without seeing

38:54.870 --> 38:58.230
甚至自己都死了
a dead body, or-or almost becoming one.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.400
我不是想逃避  哥们
I'm not running away, papi.

39:01.470 --> 39:03.900
我只是想继续生活
I'm-I'm just... I'm just moving on.

39:06.270 --> 39:08.200
这本来就与你无关
This was never about you.

39:08.270 --> 39:10.570
你为我们做的一切
Everything you did, you did for us.

39:10.630 --> 39:13.730
我此生难忘
I'll never forget that.

39:15.170 --> 39:17.070
我知道
I know you got

39:17.130 --> 39:18.370
你有要事在身
something cooking, so...

39:18.430 --> 39:20.970
无论如何  小心点  好吗
whatever it is, just be careful, okay?

39:21.030 --> 39:24.800
好
Yeah.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.330
谢谢
Thank you.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.100
等你和迈克尔安顿下来
And when you and Mike get down below

39:38.170 --> 39:39.270
开一家冲浪店
and open that surf shop...

39:39.330 --> 39:40.600
潜水店
Scuba shop.

39:40.670 --> 39:42.100
潜水店
Scuba shop.

39:42.170 --> 39:44.600
要招人时记得叫我
Maybe there will be a job there for me.

39:44.670 --> 39:46.800
没问题
You can count on it.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.570
你知道谁拿走了"锡拉"吗
Do you know who took it?

40:01.630 --> 40:04.300
不  但赛尔夫和格雷琴知道
No, but Self and Gretchen do.

40:04.370 --> 40:05.570
好
Good.

40:05.630 --> 40:06.870
你有合作伙伴了
Then you've got your team.

40:06.930 --> 40:08.900
我不会为他们卖命的
I'm not working for them.

40:08.970 --> 40:10.830
我得对我的命令
You'll work with a basset hound in a birthday hat

40:10.900 --> 40:12.400
唯命是从
if that's what I tell you to do.

40:12.470 --> 40:14.400
这是一个雇员的职责所在
That's what being an employee means.

40:16.870 --> 40:19.230
你必须接受命令并全力以赴
You're determined and dedicated.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.100
但是你简历中的空白
But there are holes in your resume

40:21.170 --> 40:24.000
格雷琴或赛尔夫  甚至巴格维尔都能填补
that Gretchen or Self or even Bagwell can fill.

40:24.070 --> 40:25.570
你们都从我这儿拿了东西
Now, you all took something from me,

40:25.630 --> 40:27.400
你们必须物归原主
and you're all going to get it back.

40:28.830 --> 40:31.400
而且
Besides...

40:31.470 --> 40:34.430
你一个人是搞不定的
you can't handle this by yourself.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.800
我觉得你应该知道
And deep down, I think you know that.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.300
让他们在外面等我吧
Have them meet me outside.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.770
谁知道呢
Who knows?

40:45.830 --> 40:48.170
你可能会喜欢上这里
You may find that you like it here.

40:48.230 --> 40:49.770
怪事接踵而至
Stranger things have happened.

40:49.830 --> 40:52.270
在你家都发生过
They've certainly happened in your family.

40:52.330 --> 40:53.970
现在
Now,

40:54.030 --> 40:56.600
关于迈克尔
about Michael.

40:57.770 --> 40:59.930
你会告诉他吗
Are you going to tell him,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
还是我去
or should I?

41:11.770 --> 41:13.270
你拿到了吗
Do you have it?

41:13.330 --> 41:14.770
拿到了
In my hand.

41:14.830 --> 41:16.930
好  你知道该怎么做
Good. You know what to do.

41:33.570 --> 41:35.600
我上次去医院看你
Last time I saw you in a hospital,

41:35.670 --> 41:37.070
是在少年棒球队时  你弄伤了胳膊
you busted your arm in Little League.

41:37.130 --> 41:39.970
是的  滑二垒时
Yeah, some bruiser knocked me down

41:40.030 --> 41:41.170
几条大汉把我撩倒了
sliding into second.

41:41.230 --> 41:42.330
真遗憾
Sorry about that.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.530
但你恢复得很好  对吧
But you healed good, though, right?

41:43.600 --> 41:45.230
是的
Yeah.

41:45.300 --> 41:48.030
这次也一样
This will, too.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.030
无论你有什么计划
Look, whatever plan you're working on

41:50.100 --> 41:53.570
把我们从这弄出去  我们最好有所行动
to get us out of here, we better make a move on it.

41:53.630 --> 41:55.700
你出不去了  迈克尔
You're not getting out of here, Michael.

41:59.070 --> 42:00.230
什么意思
What do you mean?

42:00.300 --> 42:01.530
我做了个交易
I made a deal.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.430
用"锡拉"换回你的命
Your life in exchange for Scylla.

42:05.770 --> 42:07.700
你为什么这么做
Why would you do that?

42:07.770 --> 42:09.770
就像当初你刺满纹身
Same reason you covered your body in tattoos

42:09.830 --> 42:11.330
入狱救我一样
and-and broke into Fox River.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.200
这事不仅关乎你我
This is not just about us...

42:13.270 --> 42:15.600
就是我们的事  一直如此
That's exactly who it's about. It's all it's ever been about.

42:18.700 --> 42:20.730
我们为"公司"摆平这件事
We do this one thing for the Company,

42:20.800 --> 42:22.630
然后我们重获新生
then they set us up for life.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.130
你真的相信他们吗
And you actually trust them?

42:24.200 --> 42:26.130
我还能信谁
Who else am I gonna trust?

42:26.200 --> 42:28.130
政府  唐·赛尔夫那种人
The government? Guys like Don Self?

42:28.200 --> 42:30.500
我不想再看到挚爱亲朋离去  迈克尔
I'm done watching loved ones and friends die, Michael.

42:30.570 --> 42:34.070
"锡拉"并非我们所想的那样
Scylla isn't what we thought it was.

42:34.130 --> 42:36.770
-完全不同  -我不在乎
Not even close. I don't care.

42:36.830 --> 42:38.900
我不明白你怎么这么说
I don't understand how you can say that.

42:38.970 --> 42:41.200
因为唯一值得打拼的是家庭
'Cause the only thing worth fighting for is family.

42:41.270 --> 42:44.270
我会尽一切努力结束这一切
I'm gonna do everything and anything I can to end this,

42:44.330 --> 42:45.900
你  我  所有人
so you, me, all of us

42:45.970 --> 42:47.430
才能继续我们的生活
can get on with our lives.

42:47.500 --> 42:48.930
就凭你对"公司"的了解
You think you can do that

42:49.000 --> 42:50.630
你以为你能做到吗
knowing what you know about the Company?

42:50.700 --> 42:52.630
你想知道我对公司的了解吗
You want to know what I know about the Company?

42:52.700 --> 42:56.100
妈妈生前一直为他们卖命
Mom worked for them before she died.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.730
我只是继承家族事业
I'm just moving on in the family business.

43:01.800 --> 43:02.930
林肯  别这么做
Linc, don't do this.

43:03.000 --> 43:03.930
已经说定了
It's done.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.900
林肯  林肯
Linc? Linc!
