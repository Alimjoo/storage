00:03.960 --> 00:05.230
我们必须做点什么
We gotta do something,

00:05.260 --> 00:07.130
但是一定不能伤害到别人
and it's not going to involve hurting you.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.400
我有个计划

这些罪犯一定在这其中的某个小镇里
Those cons are in one of these towns

00:13.630 --> 00:16.760
不可能逃出方圆64英里的范围
and couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.330
我要知道在这个半径范围内的一切事情
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.700

我想给总统简短的汇报下
I was expecting to brief the president.

00:23.930 --> 00:25.300
你向我汇报吧！
You report to me now.

00:25.330 --> 00:28.130

我想你还是离他远点
I want you to stay away from him.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.630

What are you talking about?

00:41.900 --> 00:43.100
那是哪里啊?
Where is that?

00:43.130 --> 00:44.900

一个小时以后我们在这里等你回来
We'll meet you right back here in an hour.

00:51.030 --> 00:54.430
把手举起来放在头后面  跪下
put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees.

00:57.430 --> 00:58.500
哦  天那
Oh, god.

00:58.530 --> 01:00.900
你个臭婊子  别发出声音
Don't say a word, you little fool

01:00.930 --> 01:02.960
否则割断你的喉咙
or I'm gonna cut your throat out.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.000
求你了!
Ah! Oh, please!

01:06.030 --> 01:08.230
你再发出声音试试
You try that again,

01:08.260 --> 01:10.160
我让你的喉咙开个洞
I'll pry those vocal chords right out of your throat.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.500

01:18.760 --> 01:21.530
她过来了
She's coming up here.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.500

妈妈  你在家吗?
Mom, you home?

01:56.530 --> 01:58.660
妈

02:46.530 --> 02:47.500
放松，放松
It's ok,It's ok.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.560
退后  把手举起来
back away and put your hands up.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.360
放松!
Just go easy.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.330
怕什么
Go nothing.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.500
她手里又没有王牌
She ain't the one carrying the cards here.

02:53.530 --> 02:55.930
退后把手举起来
Back away and put your hands up.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.360
我举起手
I put my hand up,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.430
就会把他的喉管拉出来
I'll take her jugular with it.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.730
我不想任何人做傻事  明白吗?
I don't want anyone to do anything stupid, okay?

03:04.800 --> 03:05.850
别动
Don't move.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.960
让我们文明点
uh! Let's be civil here.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.700
别挣扎了  放松
Stop.Relax.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.200
你可以走了
You can go.

03:14.230 --> 03:16.600
花具店的人说布伦斯强得和猩猩一样
Guy at the garden center said Burrows was strong as a gorilla.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.900
他们被绑住的时候正好是一点钟
It was 1:00 P.M.When they tangled it up.

03:18.930 --> 03:20.560
他认出了斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
The guy id'd both of them--Scofield, Burrows.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.000
非常确定
No doubt about it in his mind.

03:22.030 --> 03:23.760
当然  假定是一点钟
Of course, given that was 1:00 P.M.,

03:23.800 --> 03:25.930
那么他们现在已经在300英里外了
Those two could be 300 miles from here by now.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.630
你难道没发现，店里少了很多锄、铁锹和电动工具
You have a half a dozen picks
shovels and power tools missing from that store.

03:29.660 --> 03:30.860
他们还在这里  他们正在挖
They're here and they're digging.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.160
500万美元
Five million dollars

03:32.200 --> 03:34.130
就埋在图勒镇的某个地方
buried somewhere beneath the streets of Tooele.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.430
你真的相信?
You really believe that?

03:35.460 --> 03:38.030
他们相信  这个才重要
They believe that,and that's the important thing.

03:38.060 --> 03:39.400
他们现在可能在任何地方
They could be anywhere now.

03:39.430 --> 03:40.360
我们没有足够的警力
We don't have the units

03:40.400 --> 03:42.030
挨家挨户去搜查
to go door-to-door.

03:42.060 --> 03:43.360
我们不需要
We won't need them.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.000

今天晚上不行
Not tonight.

04:47.930 --> 04:48.930
别这样
Come on.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.430
我怎么听就象丹尼尔唱的歌
You sound just like Daniel.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.030
今晚不行 真的不行 －你知道吗?
Not tonight.Not tonight.You know what?

04:53.060 --> 04:55.300
如果你不介意  我真的要走了
If you don't mind,I've actually gotta go.

04:55.330 --> 04:56.600
哦...
Oh...

04:56.630 --> 04:58.530
你还好吗?
are you okay?

04:58.560 --> 04:59.630

04:59.660 --> 05:02.400
我很好  谢谢  我要走了
I'm good. Thanks. Just gotta go.

05:02.430 --> 05:03.500
莎拉
Sara.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.730
这不太妙啊
This is going wrong in every possible way.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.760
这样做太蠢了 伙计 我们不能这么做
This is stupid, man.We can not do this.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.700
事情已经这样了
Hat's over the wall now.

05:24.730 --> 05:26.930
你他妈的到底什么意思啊?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

05:28.430 --> 05:30.330
我的意思是我们已经在犯罪了
I mean we committed.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.930
那么我们就一不做二不休
It's time to go get the hat.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.730
我们没的选择
We don't have a choice.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.030
我们有  我们可以离开
Yeah, we do.We can walk right up

05:35.060 --> 05:36.900
马上离开这里  伙计
out of here right now, man.

05:36.930 --> 05:38.130
那么然后怎么办?
And then what?

05:39.900 --> 05:42.160
我们已经在这间屋子里了
We are already in the house.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.500
两个女的也被绑了
Those women are bound.

05:43.530 --> 05:45.230
我们已经犯罪了
We have already committed this crime.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.600
我们离开   不能改变已经我们已经犯罪的事实
We leave, it ain't gonna change any of that.

05:51.230 --> 05:52.660
为什么就不能只有地窖
Why couldn't there just be a silo

05:52.700 --> 05:55.800
在空旷无人的田里呢? 在一个人迹罕至的地方
in the middle of a field with no one around?

05:56.830 --> 05:58.060
我们想想办法
We'll figure it out.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.530
我们可以用另一种方法拿钱
We can get the money another way.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.360
是的 也许我可以再去抢另一家银行
Yeah, maybe I can rob another bank.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.100
你知道查尔斯曾经告诉过我
You know what Charles once said to me?

06:06.130 --> 06:09.630
罪犯就是罪犯  这罪责你甩也甩不掉
He said there's no such thing as an ex-con.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.860
因为我以前一直认为

06:11.900 --> 06:15.430
我们有办法洗清冤屈
there was a way we could wipe the slate clean,

06:15.460 --> 06:19.200
使我们所做的一切合情合理
make up for everything we've done.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.360
事情已经发生了  林肯
The hat's over the wall, Linc.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.330
对每个人都是
For everyone.

06:36.130 --> 06:41.200
现在说句对不起  对你们来说可能一点意义都没有
"Sorry" isn't going to mean anything to you right now,

06:41.210 --> 06:43.990
但我还是想说
but I want to say it anyway.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.600
这原本不该发生
This wasn't supposed to happen.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.030
再挖一两个小时我们就会走的
One or two hours tops and we'll be out of here,

06:52.060 --> 06:53.730
我可以保证

06:53.760 --> 06:55.630
没有人会伤害你们

06:59.230 --> 07:02.000

Nothing happens to them.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.460
不许
Nothing.

07:17.460 --> 07:20.460
这个医生已经开始怀疑我了
The doctor is suspicious.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.430
她应该的
She should be.

07:22.460 --> 07:24.860
你走开的时候她正在和她的州长父亲通话
She was on the line with the governor when you walked up.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.100
你在窃听他们
You were listening.

07:26.130 --> 07:28.030
他们俩的电话都装了窃听器
Both lines are tapped.

07:28.060 --> 07:29.100

07:32.160 --> 07:34.760
你知道  不是通过电话

07:34.800 --> 07:36.330
但是她父亲知道你是谁
But he knows who you are,

07:36.360 --> 07:38.230
所以她也就知道了
and so does she.

07:38.260 --> 07:39.860
本来还指望她
Seeing how she was supposed

07:39.900 --> 07:42.360
可能会带着你找到斯科菲尔德  最终找到布伦斯
to lead you to Scofield and eventually to Burrows,

07:42.400 --> 07:44.030
现在又回到了原点
it looks like we're back to square one.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.030
未必
Not necessarily.

07:45.060 --> 07:47.230
还有其他他们很在乎的人
There are other people they care about.

Okay. I don't know if he's going to be in much of a mood

08:22.660 --> 08:24.400

根据他们的说法
According to them

08:35.700 --> 08:37.230
他的提名批准程序有问题
His confirmation was going to be a problem.

08:37.260 --> 08:40.330

Super majority.

08:41.660 --> 08:44.000

雷诺仕总统曾经釜底抽薪

08:46.060 --> 08:48.330

08:48.360 --> 08:50.900
像这样的事情在政治中会发生吗?
How often does something like that happen in politics?

08:50.930 --> 08:53.130
从来没有
Never.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.960
从什么时候开始我们成了绑匪了?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.560
这可不好
It ain't right.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.260
毫无疑问...
Without a doubt...

09:04.300 --> 09:06.600
明天我们可以把良知赎回来
Well, we can buy a conscience tomorrow.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.730

为什么你不下来这个坑挖啊  伙计?

那么你来做后备怎么样  黑鬼?

09:42.130 --> 09:43.430

应该是福克斯河监狱的7个逃犯了
Should be the Fox River seven

09:55.160 --> 09:58.100
既然阿布鲁奇已经死了
now that Abruzzi's taken his dirt nap.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.200

那小子去加油很长时间了
Kid's taken a long time to fill that gas tank up.

10:16.130 --> 10:19.100
我想尽一切办法对付他
Leaned on him in every way I can think of.

10:19.130 --> 10:21.330
他  他怎么都不肯说
He's, uh...he's not talking.

10:36.230 --> 10:40.000
你是天主教徒吗?
Are you catholic?

10:40.930 --> 10:43.130
你是天主教徒吗?
Are you catholic?

10:47.830 --> 10:49.800
那没什么用
Not much good in it.

10:49.830 --> 10:51.200
充满了罪恶
Lot of guilt.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.200
招供才是出路
but the one good thing is confession.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.800
有什么事情使你烦恼
Whatever you got eating at you

10:59.830 --> 11:01.800
你只要...
you just...

11:01.830 --> 11:03.900
把它说出来
give it up.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.060
我得说  感觉就会好点
Feels good, I have to say.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.900
可能说出来
Guess it's letting it out.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.100
让别人去倾听
Letting another human being hear it.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.760
我对你没有什么好说的  伙计
I ain't got nothin' to say to you, man.

11:21.330 --> 11:24.530
如果我告诉你一些事呢?
What if I told you something?

11:24.560 --> 11:27.400
一个别人都不知道的秘密
A secret nobody else knows.

11:29.130 --> 11:32.300
奥斯卡 肖...
Oscar Shales...

11:38.700 --> 11:42.430
这个我追踪了几年的家伙
guy I was chasing a few years back.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.660
聪明透顶
Smart as hell.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.230
我...
I...

11:46.260 --> 11:49.230
总是慢一步抓不到他
kept just missing him.

11:49.260 --> 11:52.460
像是一场游戏  像...下棋
It became kind of a game, like, uh, chess.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.460
那不是很有趣
Would've almost been fun

11:56.100 --> 11:59.860
如果他没有一路杀人的话
if it weren't for the fact that he was killing people all along the way.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.430
死的人越来越多
Bodies kept stacking up

12:04.460 --> 12:07.600
我开始觉得就是因为我
And I started To feel that it was because of me.

12:07.630 --> 12:10.500
因为我没有做好我的工作
Because I couldn't do my job.

12:10.530 --> 12:15.760
我不够聪明
Because I wasn't smart enough.

12:18.430 --> 12:19.760
永远都不能抓住他
Never did catch him,

12:19.800 --> 12:23.960
让他跑了
but I did lose him.

12:25.960 --> 12:29.200
当晚上我开车的时候我会看见
I saw things when I wouldld drive at night:

12:29.230 --> 12:31.230
尸体
Bodies...

12:31.260 --> 12:34.100
这样的噩梦让我晚上无法入睡
nightmares to the point that I couldn't sleep.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.600
这...
It...

12:37.630 --> 12:40.660
这个能让我完全摆脱残酷的现实
was a complete break from reality.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.460
那是这些家伙想要的
That's what these little guys are for.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.530
让我继续留在游戏里
To keep me in the game.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.200
现在你知道了
So now you know.

12:54.230 --> 12:56.860
我终于说了出来了
Now it's off my chest.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.300
有时应该试着说出来的
Ought to try it sometime.

13:12.130 --> 13:15.500
就像刚才我说的...
Like I said before...

13:15.530 --> 13:17.960
我不会告诉你任何事情
I ain't gonna tell you nothin'.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.560
你知道那些家伙在什么地方
You know where those guys are.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.100
你如果要通过我找他们  那么伙计你找错人了
If you're looking for a rat,you got the wrong guy, man.

13:25.130 --> 13:29.760
我只想为你减轻点罪孽
Nah, I'm just trying to spare you some guilt.

13:31.900 --> 13:35.960
巴格威尔获得自由不到24个小时就杀了
Bagwell was free less than 24 hours

13:36.000 --> 13:39.530
第一个受害者
before he killed his first victim.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.960
你如果不告诉我他在那里
If you don't tell me where he is now,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.630
他还会再杀人的
he's gonna kill again

13:44.660 --> 13:47.600
那些血只会让你良心不安
And that blood is gonna be on your conscience

13:47.630 --> 13:49.560
而不是别人
And nobody else's.

13:54.900 --> 13:59.730
招供并不是件坏事  嗯?
Confession might not be such a bad thing, huh?

14:06.260 --> 14:09.100
- 他刚到  LJ   - 不可能啊
-He just arrived, LJ. - That's impossible.

14:09.130 --> 14:14.060
我没有约见我的律师啊
I-I don't have a meeting scheduled with my lawyer.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.430
他是伊利诺斯州法庭指定的一个公共辩护律师
He's a court-appointed public defender in illinois.

14:17.460 --> 14:20.660
我不确定怎么他不通知我 就来亚利桑那州找我呢
I doubt he would come to arizona without calling me.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.560
我们走吧
Let's go.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.530
是
yeah.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.260
我们已经在亚利桑那州 布伦斯儿子的身边安插了人
We're all set in arizona with the Burrows kid.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.730
好的
Good.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.860
最好能让这小子消失
The kid's as good as gone.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.830
你刚才说那律师叫什么?
What'd you say the name of that lawyer was?

15:08.860 --> 15:10.200
别跟我说
Didn't give it to me.

15:10.230 --> 15:11.530
跟监狱长去说
Gave it to the warden.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.560
那我想和监狱长谈谈
Then I want to talk to the warden.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.860

15:45.830 --> 15:47.300

They didn't tell you

15:47.330 --> 15:48.760
我为什么来这?
Why I came here?

15:48.800 --> 15:49.860

17:26.050 --> 17:27.610

是为了防止流产的二甲双胍(降血糖药)
They're metformin to prevent a miscarriage.

求你了

17:32.350 --> 17:34.980
在厨房的抽屉里
They're in the drawer in the kitchen.

等下  我想问个问题
Wait, before you do,I just have one more question.

18:09.710 --> 18:12.380
你看上去是一个好人
You seem like a really good guy.

18:12.410 --> 18:15.180
为什么要这么做?
Why are you doing this?

18:18.680 --> 18:21.680
我不是个好人
I'm not a good guy.

18:24.380 --> 18:27.310
...你认为他们真的能将凶残的人
anything Changes, do you really think they'll help keep predators

18:27.350 --> 18:29.950
诸如帝博格顺利逮捕?
like Theodore Bagwell safely behind bars?

18:31.380 --> 18:35.910
这照片让我看起来像反社会的人
picture makes me look like a sociopath.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.380
我不是和你开玩笑  废物
I'm not joking with you, trailer park.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.550
马上给我来挖!
Now, get in here and dig!

18:53.750 --> 18:56.050
大概一个半小时了
An hour and a half, maybe.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.310
花一个半小时加一箱油?
Hour and a half to fill a tank of gas?

18:58.350 --> 19:00.910
有点不对劲 事情有了突破性的进展
that ain't right. There has been a breaking development

19:00.950 --> 19:02.810
两起故意杀人起诉案中
In the double homicide prosecution

19:02.850 --> 19:04.310
林肯 布伦斯 Jr
of Lincoln Burrows Jr.

19:04.350 --> 19:07.580
由于丢失了重要的血液证据以及...
Due to the sudden disappearance of crucial blood and...

19:07.610 --> 19:09.880
林肯  我不知道你还有个儿子
hey, Linc, I didn't know you had a boy.

19:09.910 --> 19:12.280
鉴于此库克郡(伊利诺州)地区检察院
...Itself, the Cook county district attorney's office

19:12.310 --> 19:14.550
迫不得已只能撤销
had no choice but to drop

19:14.580 --> 19:18.110
对这个16岁男孩的所有指控
All chargesagainst the 16-year-old.

19:18.150 --> 19:19.810
布伦斯按计划将于
Burrows is scheduled to be released

明日在其关押地
from the Klipton Detention Center

19:21.310 --> 19:24.380
亚利桑那州的克利普顿拘留中心
in Kingman, Arizona,

19:24.410 --> 19:26.880
被释放
where he's currently being held, tomorrow morning.

19:31.450 --> 19:35.010
车钥匙呢  在哪里?
keys to the car--where are they?

19:35.050 --> 19:38.210
你不能这么做  林肯
You can't do this. Linc.

19:39.410 --> 19:41.050
只要再5分钟就行了
We're five minutes away in there.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.880
我们这样都已经弄了4个小时了
We've been five minutes for four hours.

19:42.910 --> 19:45.310
再给我点时间  耐心点
Just give me some time. Be patient.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.110
你以为我不想挖到那该死的钱?
You think I give a damn about the money?

19:47.150 --> 19:48.210
我别无选择!
I'm doing what's necessary!

19:48.250 --> 19:49.380
你害怕失败
You're afraid to fail--

19:49.410 --> 19:50.950
你害怕这个宏伟的计划不能成功
you're afraid this big plan of yours ain't gonna work out.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.410
如果为了证明你能成功而最后被抓住
You want to get caught proving you can

19:52.450 --> 19:53.810
那随便你
pull this thing off, be my guest.

19:53.850 --> 19:56.110
LJ被释放了  我要去接他
LJ's out there;I'm gonna get him.

19:56.150 --> 19:58.180
我们已经走了1500英里
We have come 1, 500 miles

19:58.210 --> 19:59.410
穿越了全国
across the country.

19:59.450 --> 20:00.650
我们已经
We have made it

20:00.680 --> 20:02.780
走到了这一步
this far.

20:04.750 --> 20:08.410
那我想我们得在这分道扬镳了
Then I guess this is where we part ways.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.650
审讯有进展吗?
Any word of how  the interrogation's going?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.380
那孩子还是什么都不说
Nah, the kid's  still stonewalling,

20:50.410 --> 20:51.780
但我们有了帕托塞克确切的消息
but we've got confirmation on Patoshik;

20:51.810 --> 20:55.250
那老太太的家里到处都是他的指纹
his prints were all over that old lady's house.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.950
他没拿钱也没拿珠宝
So he leaves the cash and the jewelry.

20:57.980 --> 21:01.610
只拿走了那幅值10美元的油画
The only thing he steals is a ten-dollar oil painting.

21:01.650 --> 21:04.350
这家伙他妈搞什么鬼?
What the hell's wrong with that?

21:25.880 --> 21:27.910
有什么我可以帮忙的吗?
is there something I can help you with?

21:29.010 --> 21:31.510
什么?不  要知道
what?No.You know

21:31.550 --> 21:34.380
用推车装那些东西会容易点
it'd be a little easier if you use the cart for all that stuff.

21:34.410 --> 21:38.050
我只是想  我想...看看这个袋子能否装下
I'm just, uh, I wanted to...see if it'd all fit in the bag.

21:41.580 --> 21:44.280
你的膝盖怎么了?
what happened to your knee there?

21:44.310 --> 21:46.150
摩托车事故
Motorcycle accident.

21:47.410 --> 21:49.750
你行动不太方便  是吧?
you don't move around too well, then, do you?

21:49.780 --> 21:51.380
是不太方便
Not very.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.080
那好
That's good.

22:10.980 --> 22:15.580
你可以跟我一起走
you can still come with me.

22:15.610 --> 22:17.780
不  我...
No, I can...

22:19.550 --> 22:21.380
我自己能行
I can do this.

22:24.050 --> 22:25.110
那如果不行呢?
And if you can't?

22:25.150 --> 22:27.110
那我们还是在
Then we still meet up

22:27.150 --> 22:29.180
约定好的地方见  波修瓦 波兹 (可能是美国边境线往墨西哥去的一条小路)
exactly where we planned.Bolshee Booze.

22:29.210 --> 22:30.450

22:36.610 --> 22:38.110
怎么会忘呢?
How can I forget?

22:38.150 --> 22:41.380

22:41.410 --> 22:43.080
那是我们最后的机会
It's our last shot.

22:45.150 --> 22:46.780
如果我们  呃...
If we're, uh...

22:48.680 --> 22:50.650
如果一切顺利的话
if we do this right

22:50.680 --> 22:52.410
我们就可以永远离开这
we're gone forever.

22:52.450 --> 22:56.150
三天时间还有很多事要干
Lot of ground to cover in three days.

22:56.180 --> 22:58.210
很多
Lot of ground.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.980

23:05.110 --> 23:06.710
他们会追捕你的
They'll be gunning for you.

23:08.510 --> 23:11.480
他们会想尽一切办法抓你  所以...
They'll get you any way they can, so...

23:11.510 --> 23:13.350
是的

Three days.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.480
小心点
Keep your head down.

23:58.310 --> 23:59.580
唐克雷蒂小姐
Ms.Tancredi...

23:59.650 --> 24:02.780
你好

24:02.810 --> 24:05.350
我只是想告诉你
I just wanted to let you know that

24:05.380 --> 24:07.250
法医已经初步检验了尸体

24:07.280 --> 24:09.280
她发现
She found

24:09.310 --> 24:11.550

24:13.950 --> 24:16.050
我知道这对你是个打击
I know it's a shock

24:16.080 --> 24:18.050
但我们已经问过外面的安全人员
but we've also spoken to the detail guard stationed outside

24:18.080 --> 24:20.480
他说从华盛顿回来后除了你父亲
and he didn't see anyone other than your father

24:20.510 --> 24:21.950
就没有任何人
enter or exit the mansion

24:21.980 --> 24:23.750
进出过这栋大楼
since he came back from Washington.

26:12.050 --> 26:14.750

37:37.550 --> 37:38.780

39:13.950 --> 39:14.910
你很清楚  对吗?
You realize that, don't you?

39:14.950 --> 39:16.080
你们不仅会被指控越狱
You're not just gonna be dealing with escape charges

39:16.110 --> 39:17.180
还有故意伤害

39:17.210 --> 39:18.250

39:29.180 --> 39:31.010
我会为你出庭作证
I will testify at the sentencing.

39:31.050 --> 39:32.210
我会说你配合警方

39:32.250 --> 39:33.310
那样就会完全不同
That can make a huge difference.

闭嘴
Shut up.

39:34.480 --> 39:35.650
