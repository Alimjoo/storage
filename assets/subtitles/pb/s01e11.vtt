00:25.230 --> 00:28.500
白人不要你 黑人也不要你
Whites don't want you, blacks don't want you.

00:28.510 --> 00:32.120
你被夹在了中间 不是吗 典型的两头不是人

00:35.920 --> 00:37.380
你怎么这么愤世嫉俗
Why are you so cynical?

00:37.390 --> 00:39.900
迈克尔这是人情冷暖和现实主义
I think there's cynicism and then there's realism.

你想知道库珀的事？ 我无可奉告  因为我不是他
You want the Cooper story?I can't give it to you.Cos I'm not him.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.600

00:56.610 --> 00:57.980

02:14.570 --> 02:16.440

是啊 看这里一团糟 印象深刻
Yeah. All this clutter, it's overwhelming.

02:23.450 --> 02:24.710
你要看看我住的住处再下结论
You should see my apartment.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.950
我们连一次约会都没有过
Haven't even had our first date yet,

02:27.960 --> 02:30.560
你就邀请我去你家了
and you're already inviting me in.

02:30.570 --> 02:32.310
我还以为你是个正经的女孩
I thought you were a nice girl.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.530
大家都知道正经女孩 总要最后才找到归宿
Michael, we all know nice girls finish last.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.000
那你的归宿在哪里?
So where do you finish?

02:39.010 --> 02:43.480

03:42.980 --> 03:45.580
这个不是我的目的
This is not what I signed on for.

03:45.590 --> 03:48.650
你想要我们怎么做? 摇白旗?还是叫中场暂停?
What do you want us to do?Wave the white flag?

03:48.660 --> 03:50.450
我只是不想让林肯死

03:50.460 --> 03:51.340

我们刚刚了解到 副总统莱娜斯从研究项目中
Vice President Reynolds funnelled millions

03:54.330 --> 03:56.370
抽取了巨额资产注入她弟弟的公司

03:56.380 --> 03:58.840
这笔资金有被分散到很多小帐户上
That money was filtered into small accounts

03:58.850 --> 04:01.310
成为她竞选资金的主要来源
that made small donations to her campaign,

04:01.320 --> 04:03.830
让她成为自由世界的下一界领袖
setting her up to be the leader of the Free World.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.260
现在我们要做的  不止是阻止死刑这么简单
This doesn't end with us stopping an execution.

04:07.270 --> 04:10.390
对我来说  是的
For me it does.

04:29.750 --> 04:33.100
好了 换岗
OK. Let's rotate.

04:33.110 --> 04:37.030
后庭花中士 轮到你下去了
Sergeant Sodomy, you're up next.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.320
拉我一把
Come on.

04:41.330 --> 04:44.730
我不了解你 但...
I don't know about y'all, but...

04:44.820 --> 04:49.030
这地方对我来说太"黑"了  我挖不了
This room is getting a little too dark for me to dig.

04:49.260 --> 04:55.100
你是说 这个监狱居然有个洞 你不愿意"进"的?
Are you telling me that there's a hole in Fox River that you don't want to get into?

04:56.040 --> 04:57.060
什么?

04:57.070 --> 04:59.750
嘿 别闹事
Hey. No one gets hurt.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.340
我就弄不明白了
Hey, you know, I got a question.

05:02.350 --> 05:05.720
那边的"小面条"怎么就连铲子都不用抓
Now, how come Fusilli over here ain't grabbing a shovel?

05:05.730 --> 05:08.050
我在这里当家
I handle arrangements on the outside.

05:08.060 --> 05:10.340

05:10.350 --> 05:12.660

Exactly. Makes me manager.

05:12.670 --> 05:14.540
而我们就是些苦力了
And that makes us just labour, right?

05:14.550 --> 05:18.090
现在你明白了
Mm-hm. Now you're getting it.

05:18.650 --> 05:23.020
当家的最好留意这里的情况
You know, management better keep a close eye on the conditions up in here.

05:23.030 --> 05:25.590
不然苦力也会罢工的 知道吗？
Or the labour's liable to go on strike.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.960
回去干活
Get back to work.

05:26.970 --> 05:30.380
狱警来了

05:41.260 --> 05:44.040
把那个放回那里
Put that back up there.

Had a conjugal, I mean.

06:43.720 --> 06:44.880

06:57.520 --> 06:59.410
你对她有印象吗?
She look familiar to you?

06:59.420 --> 07:02.720

07:25.190 --> 07:28.020

Is it awful, being here?

07:28.030 --> 07:30.160
记得你呆的第一个地方吗？
Remember the first place you stayed?

07:30.170 --> 07:33.180
机场边的旅馆
That hotel, by the airport?

07:33.190 --> 07:37.700
区别只是69美元的房租和免费的洗发水
Only difference is $69 and the free shampoo.

07:37.710 --> 07:41.150
你还是一副勇敢的表情
Always the brave face.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.740

Is there anything else that I can do?

07:53.540 --> 07:56.520
就事先约定的可以了
Just what we agreed on.

07:56.840 --> 08:00.670
他们搜查我的时候我很害怕
I was so nervous when they were checking.

08:00.910 --> 08:03.380
有个问题
One question.

08:03.390 --> 08:07.360
在监狱里要信用卡有什么用？
Why would you need a credit card in prison?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.910

The riot didn't change anything.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.630

他是州长 但他同时也是你父亲
He's the governor, but also your father.

08:17.090 --> 08:21.390
或许他认为只要他减得够狠 他们就没钱雇你了
Maybe he thinks if he cuts enough,they can't afford you.

08:33.420 --> 08:37.840
你也知道夫妻探访后的例行步骤吧 斯科菲尔德?
You understand this is standard procedure following a conjugal, right?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.930
总要小心才是
Never can be too careful.

08:39.940 --> 08:43.770
好了 弯腰
All right. Bend over.

08:43.780 --> 08:47.690
在房间里和那妞过的愉快吧
You have a good time in the romper room with that Euro?

09:00.410 --> 09:02.820
一石二鸟
Killing two birds with one bone.

09:02.830 --> 09:06.280

-Catching my drift?  -I wouldn't know.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.660
好了 没问题 长官
All right. He's clear, Captain.

09:08.670 --> 09:10.850
最好去洗个澡 斯科菲尔德
Make sure you take a shower, Scofield.

09:10.860 --> 09:15.080
天知道有些女人会给你带来什么
You never know what some women can give you.

09:28.170 --> 09:31.430
你知道这个的 不是吗?
You know this one, don't you?

09:36.580 --> 09:38.140
嘿 来点反应啊
Come on, gimme something.

09:38.150 --> 09:40.780

You know, your parents must be so proud of you, man.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.640
就像中了头彩一样
Hitting the trailer park trifecta.

09:46.650 --> 09:49.010
种族主义 恋童癖
You're a racist, a paedophile,

09:49.020 --> 09:51.780
呆头呆脑
 and stupid.

09:51.790 --> 09:54.940
我真的很气愤
You know, it vexes me that

09:54.950 --> 09:57.550
在这个屋子里就我被认为是坏家伙
I'm made out to be the bad guy in the room.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.320
你们难道都是 因为偷小女孩的饼干才被抓进来的
Y'all ain't here for stealing Girl Scout cookies.

10:00.330 --> 10:04.540
我们可没有在偷饼干时 杀卖饼的小女孩
None of us murdered any Girl Scouts in the process.

10:04.550 --> 10:06.860
迈克尔回来了
Michael's coming back from the boneyard.

10:06.870 --> 10:10.420
一个人
Alone, alone.

10:15.190 --> 10:17.080
我把我和玛丽克鲁兹的事情都告诉你了
I tell you everything about me,

10:17.090 --> 10:18.600
你居然连你结婚了都不告诉我
you don't tell me you're married?

10:18.610 --> 10:21.120
以后再说
Later.

10:22.010 --> 10:24.660
狂野一日游啊 斯科菲尔德?
Rough day, huh, Scofield?

10:24.670 --> 10:27.890
我们这些人在这里搞混凝土
While the rest of us are in here slinging concrete,

10:27.900 --> 10:32.540
而你却让马子来擦你生了锈的长枪
you got some little girl in to play on your rusty trombone, huh?

10:32.550 --> 10:34.240
这家伙说得没错
Man's got a point.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.570
这有点不公平 知道我说什么吧?
It just doesn't seem equitable, like.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.170

Shut up and dig, T-Bag.

10:38.180 --> 10:41.860
我想我们这里的人是想知道
I think what the idiots inside want to know is,

我要去购物了
I'm going shopping.

They won't be catching me with one.

11:09.710 --> 11:13.450

13:36.470 --> 13:38.910
-井已经干枯了 -老天 我的腿

13:47.770 --> 13:50.630

14:10.700 --> 14:12.730

你住过高级旅馆吗?LJ
You ever stayed at a fancy hotel, LJ?

16:11.670 --> 16:14.200
早上你离开房间的时候 一塌糊涂
You leave your room in the morning, it's a mess.

16:14.210 --> 16:16.370
湿的脏毛巾扔在浴室地上
Wet dirty towels on the bathroom floor,

16:16.380 --> 16:19.630
昨晚送来的外卖变质发臭
last night's room service stinking to high heaven.

16:19.640 --> 16:24.950
但是 晚上你回到房间的时候  它们不见了
Then, you come back at night, it's all gone.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.610
新的毛巾  干净的床单  枕头上的糖
Fresh towels, sheets, candy on the pillow.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.490
简直是世界上最美好的感觉
It's just the best feeling in the whole world.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.290
有人替你收拾了一切
Cos someone else cleaned up your mess.

16:32.300 --> 16:36.000
你只需要出去散散步
All you had to do was walk away.

16:37.610 --> 16:39.900
不准你伤害他们
Don't you hurt them.

16:39.910 --> 16:41.260
好
OK.

16:41.270 --> 16:45.490
但你要告诉我他们知道多少  他们还告诉了哪些人
But you gotta tell me exactly what they know and who else they've told,

16:45.500 --> 16:47.710
那样今晚就没人会死
and nobody has to die tonight.

16:47.720 --> 16:52.740
你出去散散步  让我来收拾
You just walk away. Let me clean up your mess.

16:52.750 --> 16:57.180
我根本不知道怎么回事  我向上帝发誓!
I don't know what's going on.I swear to God.

16:57.190 --> 17:00.690
真希望我可以相信你
Well, I wish I could believe that.

17:07.090 --> 17:09.070
贝利克指派了一个新室友给我
Bellick assigned me a new cellmate.

17:09.080 --> 17:10.110
什么样的?
Who'd you get?

17:10.120 --> 17:14.940
某个新来的笨蛋  偷钱包偷到一个休班警员头上
Some new fish. Ran a bump and swipe on an off-duty cop.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.290
手快  嘴更快
Fast hands, faster mouth.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.960
哟  聊什么呢兄弟们?
Yo, what's cracking, my peoples?

17:18.970 --> 17:22.720
说曹操 曹操到 迈克尔斯科菲尔德 这是大卫·阿克斯
Speak of the devil.Michael Scofield, David Apolskis.

17:22.730 --> 17:23.810
你好

17:23.820 --> 17:27.510
我见过你  对吧? 你是PI的
I seen you before, right? You're part of that PI crew.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.080
也许你能让我参一份
Maybe you can hook me up.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.030
你知道 兄弟我也要弄点绿色
Brother needs to make some green

17:31.040 --> 17:33.020
绿色的钞票  你懂我意思?

17:33.030 --> 17:34.780
时薪19美分
The pay is 19 cents an hour.

17:34.790 --> 17:37.780
19美分 简直是奴役
19 cents? That's slavery, yo.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.480
这里是监狱哟
That's prison, yo.

17:39.490 --> 17:43.610
何况  PI已经满人了
And besides, PI's all full up for now.

17:43.620 --> 17:46.310
好吧  我理解你的意思
All right. I feel you.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.820
如果有什么好处 记得关照小弟一下  好吧?
But keep a brother in mind, if something opens up, yo.

17:49.830 --> 17:54.980
我宁愿付19美分一个小时 出来多放风一会儿
Hell, I'll pay 19 cents an hour to get me some more time out of the block.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.640
像重新养一个孩子
Like having another kid.

17:56.650 --> 18:00.340
我已经养大了一个  再来一次可受不了
Already raised one. I'm too old to do it again.

18:00.350 --> 18:03.500
你听过有囚犯入狱前保管的财物 被盗的事情吗?
You ever hear of anything being stolen from R&D?

18:03.510 --> 18:04.750
当然
Of course.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.240
狱警经常偷偷拿东西
Bulls steal from personals all the time.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.120
问题是
Problem is,

18:08.130 --> 18:11.050
只有到出狱领回财物  你才会知道他们拿了什么
you never know what's gone until you're outside of the walls.

18:11.060 --> 18:13.120
那时你也无能为力了
At that point, you can't do anything about it.

18:13.130 --> 18:15.820
如果是现在知道呢?
What if you knew now?

18:15.880 --> 18:20.470
听着 我说过了  无论你计划做什么  不要拉我下水
Look, I told you. Leave me out of whatever it is you've got going.

18:20.480 --> 18:24.040
我只想问你是否见过 某个狱警戴着一只金表
I just need to know if you've seen a guard with a gold watch.

18:24.050 --> 18:27.150
很多人可以给你搞一块金表进来
There's a lot of people can get you a gold watch in here.

18:27.150 --> 18:29.820
对  但是我就需要这块
Yeah, but I need this specific gold watch.

18:29.830 --> 18:31.590
韦斯特莫兰德
Westmoreland.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.030
狱长要你去一下
Pope wants to see you.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.460
走吧!
Let's go.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.490
听着  我没看见有
Look, I haven't seen nothing.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.630
但有那么一个狱警
But there is this one CO.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.560
称得上是全监狱最菜的扒手
Word is he's the worst thief in here.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.990
我老婆从县档案处 给你发的传真
My wife faxed this over from County Records.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.020
斯科菲尔德的结婚证明复印件
Copy of Scofield's marriage licence.

18:53.030 --> 18:55.090
她说你欠她个大人情
She says you owe her, big time.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.560
看来是真的  他不是随便找个婊子来扮老婆
Looks legit. He wasn't trying to sneak in some whore for a conjugal.

18:58.570 --> 19:02.210
这里写着  他是在抢劫前一天结婚的
Says here they got married the day before Scofield robbed that bank.

19:02.220 --> 19:05.430
为什么他要那样做?
Why the hell would he do that?

19:11.460 --> 19:15.920
-有维罗妮卡的消息?  -没有
-Heard from Veronica?  -No.

19:15.930 --> 19:19.350
LJ送来个便条  说跟她在一起 很安全
Just a note from LJ saying he was with her, he's safe.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.500
但已经有一段时间了  有点不对劲
But it's been a while. Doesn't feel right.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.940
不对劲
Feels wrong.

19:26.940 --> 19:29.480
非常不对劲
Really wrong.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.130
我 呃...
I, uh...

19:39.140 --> 19:41.570
我终于意识到
I've come to a realisation.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.620
要么多诺万小姐和那男孩 并不在喜欢你
Either Ms Donovan and that boy don't like you very much,

19:44.630 --> 19:49.580
要么他们对你的生存能力 抱有难以理解的信心
or they have an unreasonable amount of faith in your cardiovascular system.

19:49.590 --> 19:53.680
告诉我吧 尼克 这就是你拿到的全部?
So tell me, Nick.This all you got?

19:53.690 --> 19:56.850
一份毫无根据的申诉?
This paper trail of an indictment that never even happened?

19:56.860 --> 19:58.370
就这么多?
Is this it?

19:58.380 --> 20:00.510
我们知道你们丢了那盘录像带
We know you don't have a surveillance tape any more,

20:00.520 --> 20:02.700
我们知道你们再也没有证人
you have nobody to testify.

20:02.710 --> 20:05.860
你们就剩那么一点东西?
So is this really all you've got?

20:07.410 --> 20:11.920
萨维恩先生  穿过你大圆肌的那颗子弹
Mr Savrinn, that bullet went through your teres major,

20:11.930 --> 20:13.920
扯碎了你肩胛骨外侧的肌肉
ripped the lateral margin of your scapula,

20:13.930 --> 20:17.010
使你的手臂完全不能转动
leaving you no medial rotation of your arm.

20:17.020 --> 20:21.240
所以如果你想用那块木头打我
So if you try to swing that piece of lumber at me...

20:22.010 --> 20:27.570
手臂就会疼的像断掉一样
It's gonna feel like your arm is ripping out of its socket.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.860
来吧  尼克 "正义计划"先生
Come on, Nick. Mr Project Justice.

20:31.870 --> 20:34.430
我们都知道你为什么坐在这里
We both know why you're really here, don't we?

20:34.440 --> 20:38.750
你并不是为了救林肯·布伦斯
And it ain't to save Lincoln Burrows' life.

20:44.550 --> 20:48.360
在这高墙里  我缓慢的爬行
Inside these walls, I creep and I crawl,

20:48.370 --> 20:51.420
寻找一条逃生的路子  但是我知道这却不是一件好差事
looking for a way out, But I know there's gonna be no easy route

20:51.430 --> 20:55.950
这将是12个轮回... 12个轮回一个周期
This is gonna be a 12-round...12-round bout

20:55.960 --> 20:58.550
和贝利克一起 帝博格在我脑海里...
Bellick and T-Bag on my mind

20:58.560 --> 21:01.400
这真是遭罪...
This grind in here...

21:02.250 --> 21:05.320
还有兴趣参加劳动团吗?
You still interested in getting in on PI?

21:05.330 --> 21:07.470
我母亲是女人吗?
Does my momma got big breastices?

21:07.480 --> 21:08.590
我可不知道
I wouldn't know.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.550
她当然是女人  而我当然愿意
Hell, yeah, she does. And hell, yeah, I do.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.230
好吧  听着  帮我个忙
All right, look. I need a favour.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.760
听说你是个老练的街头扒手
Word is you made your trade as a snatch and grab.

21:16.770 --> 21:17.870
没错
That's right.

21:17.880 --> 21:21.360
我要你帮我 偷一件被别人偷走的东西
I need you to steal something back that was stolen from me.

21:21.370 --> 21:23.220
一件什么东西?
What kind of something?

21:23.230 --> 21:24.330
一块手表
Just a watch.

21:24.340 --> 21:27.100
绝对不止一块手表那么简单
Uh-uh. There ain't no such thing as just a watch.

21:27.110 --> 21:29.010
每样东西都有它不同的偷法
Every design has a different clasp,

21:29.020 --> 21:31.200
每种扣子都有不同的偷法
every clasp has a different swipe.

21:31.210 --> 21:33.400
意大利表  Remedi
It's Italian. A Remedi.

21:33.410 --> 21:35.640
金表带  珍珠面  全天候
Gold band, pearl face, all-weather.

21:35.650 --> 21:37.530
-哪一年?  -2003
-What year?  -2003.

21:37.540 --> 21:39.730
那玩意儿有个蝴蝶扣
That's a butterfly clasp on that bitch.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.520
-什么意思?  -内藏结构
-Which means what?  -Hidden deployment.

21:42.530 --> 21:47.080
所以没法把它扒走 而不引起任何感觉
There ain't no way to snatch it without the mark feeling it.

21:48.010 --> 21:53.520
所以要偷它  必须用我的独门秘方
Which just means I'm gonna have to get whimsical on this ficky.

21:55.670 --> 21:58.470
我偷到表  你就让我进囚犯劳动团?
I get you this watch, that means I get in on some PI?

21:58.480 --> 22:01.610
我会考虑  但不一定
It means I'll think about it. No promises.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.800
为什么你那么急着想要这块表?
Why you need this watch so bad, anyway?

22:04.810 --> 22:09.010
它对我的某个家人意义重大
Let's just say it means a lot to someone in my family.

22:22.990 --> 22:26.110
进来  查尔斯  坐下
Come in, Charles. Sit down.

22:31.570 --> 22:34.240
怎么回事?
What's going on?

22:36.420 --> 22:39.290
我有个坏消息  查尔斯
I've got some bad news, Charles.

22:39.300 --> 22:42.160
你的女儿得了重病
Your daughter is very sick.

22:42.170 --> 22:44.650
她得了食道癌
She's got oesophageal cancer.

22:44.660 --> 22:48.660
她在印第安那波利斯的圣心医院
Now, she's at Sacred Heart, in Indianapolis,

22:48.670 --> 22:52.800
她想在最后的时间里见到你
and she wants to see you while there's still time.

22:52.810 --> 22:54.760
还有多久?
How much time?

22:54.770 --> 22:56.970
医生说只有几周
Doctors say a few weeks.

22:56.980 --> 22:59.870
问题是  惩教署不打算让你去
The problem is, the DOC isn't gonna let you go.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.860
他们认为你还具有危胁
They think you're still a flight risk.

23:01.870 --> 23:05.560
-她是我唯一的孩子  -我知道
-She's my only child.  -I know that.

23:05.570 --> 23:08.550
相信我  查尔斯 我用你的良好记录做过申诉
Believe me, Charles, I've lobbied on your behalf.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.820
这是本州的政策
It's state policy.

23:11.830 --> 23:17.540
只有葬礼可以得到临时出狱许可
They will only extend furloughs in the case of funerals.

23:17.550 --> 23:19.770
你是在说
You're telling me

23:19.780 --> 23:26.130
我必须等到她死了 才可以见到她?
I have to wait until she dies before I see her?

23:32.820 --> 23:37.690
斯科菲尔德先生  今天将会由我为你注射
Mr Scofield. Looks like I'll be administering your shot today.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.270
唐克雷蒂医生呢?
Where's Dr Tancredi?

23:39.280 --> 23:42.770
今天日程很满  她有其他病人
We've got a busy schedule today.She's with another patient.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.380
按住他  别让他掉下推床!
Hold his legs! Hold his legs down!

23:44.390 --> 23:46.420
按住脚!按住他的脚!
Hold his legs! Hold his legs down!

23:46.430 --> 23:48.260
嘿  我们需要医生!
Hey, we need a doctor here!

23:48.270 --> 23:49.360
好了 发生什么事?
What happened?

23:49.370 --> 23:51.680
我不知道 这孩子正在吃饭 突然间
The kid was in chow, all of a sudden

23:51.690 --> 23:54.120
他就发病了 开始呕吐
he collapsed and started spitting up his food.

23:54.130 --> 23:56.110
看来他正在痉挛
Looks like some kind of seizure.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.280
把他抬上来
Get him up here.

23:57.290 --> 23:59.290
别让他伤到自己
make sure he doesn't hurt himself.

23:59.300 --> 24:03.040
我需要氧气和镇静剂
I'll need O2 and cardio from you.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.840
按住他  按住他!
Hold him. Hold him!

24:33.280 --> 24:39.390
多诺万小姐  你的不动产法律经验
So, Ms Donovan.How is that background in real estate law going for you?

24:39.400 --> 24:43.090
真的派上用场了?
Is it a big help?

24:43.100 --> 24:45.490
我们终于取得点突破了
Well, frankly I think we caught a break.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.030
林肯有个比他聪明很多的女友
If Lincoln had nailed a girl with half a brain,

24:48.040 --> 24:52.640
她几乎快要解决这件事了
she probably would have brought this whole thing down already.

24:53.170 --> 24:56.000
但你知道坏的部分是什么?
But you know what the worst part is?

24:56.010 --> 24:57.560
你拖了一群人下水
You dragged these people

24:57.570 --> 25:01.340
明知自己无法让他们脱身
into this knowing that you had no clue how to get them out.

25:01.350 --> 25:03.520
我是说  如果你不那么好管闲事
I mean, if you had just minded your own business,

25:03.530 --> 25:05.370
像莱提莎·巴里斯这样的人
people like Leticia Barris,

25:05.380 --> 25:08.080
现在就不会死都没人知道
she wouldn't have a mouthful of maggots now.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.890
你的未婚夫也不会倒毙在公寓
Your fiance would not be lying in his apartment

25:10.900 --> 25:12.960
等着尸体开始发臭
waiting for the smell of his rotting corpse

25:12.970 --> 25:17.040
以便邻居可以闻到才发觉他死了
to let the neighbours know that something had gone horribly wrong.

25:17.050 --> 25:20.370
没错  他们的死就是因为你
That's right.Their deaths are on your head.

25:20.380 --> 25:22.650
你造成的
You made this mess.

25:22.660 --> 25:25.080
不是别人 是你
Nobody else. You.

25:25.090 --> 25:30.300
但同样是你 可以让这一切结束
But you are also the one person that can end it all right here.

25:30.310 --> 25:34.190
我只想知道你还牵扯了谁
All I need to know is who else you've involved.

25:34.200 --> 25:40.300
你可以点头 让我知道你愿意说
So you just nod, and I'll know you're ready to talk.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.780
你知道 多诺万小姐 我觉得 呃
You know, Ms Donovan, I think that

25:51.790 --> 25:53.810
看来你有点着凉
you look a little cold.

25:53.820 --> 25:58.030
也许这样你能让你更容易说出来
Maybe you'll find it easier to talk

25:58.040 --> 26:01.710
你就可以说话了
after you've warmed up a little...

26:08.500 --> 26:10.210
他在哪?发生什么了?
Where is he? What happened?

26:10.220 --> 26:14.570
我们要离开这里 快点 没时间了 快点!
We gotta move. Come on, we don't have time. Come on.

26:14.630 --> 26:18.110
快点 我们离开这里
Come on. We're getting out of here.

26:19.230 --> 26:20.560
钥匙在哪?
Where are the keys?

26:20.570 --> 26:22.620
口袋里
Pocket. Left.

26:22.630 --> 26:24.140
把车打着!
Start the car.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.230
他会没事吗?
Is he gonna be all right?

26:25.240 --> 26:27.020
去把车打着 LJ!
Go start the car, LJ.

26:27.030 --> 26:30.790
我们会把你送去医院 好吗?
Come on. We're gonna get you to a hospital.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.720
我室友送你的礼物
A gift from my cellmate.

27:02.730 --> 27:06.050
谢谢你 和他
Thank you. And thank him.

27:06.060 --> 27:08.390
这只表  有什么特别?
The watch. What's it for, anyway?

27:08.400 --> 27:10.760
我以为你不想知道我的计划
Thought you didn't want to know about this.

27:10.770 --> 27:12.700
情况变了
Things have changed.

27:12.710 --> 27:14.250
我要加入
I want in.

27:14.260 --> 27:16.170
为什么这么突然?
Why the sudden change of heart?

27:16.180 --> 27:18.080
我有我的理由

27:18.090 --> 27:19.750
千万别选错路
Don't take this the wrong way,

27:19.760 --> 27:24.090
每个加入的人  都得给其他人一个交待
but everyone who's in is bringing something to the table.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.260
用钱来作交待怎样?
How about money?

27:25.270 --> 27:27.780
-我们在谈多少钱?  -我以为你知道
-How much?  -I think you know.

27:27.790 --> 27:32.120
我只记得某些谈话 最后以"我不是D.B.库珀"结束
I remember several conversations that ended with "I am not DB Cooper".

27:32.130 --> 27:33.830
-我说谎  -你说谎?
-I lied.  -You lied.

27:33.840 --> 27:36.430
我们是罪犯 我们擅长那样做
We're cons. We tend to do that.

27:36.440 --> 27:39.170
我查过你的辩护词
I checked your alibi.

27:39.180 --> 27:42.760
根据记录 库珀劫持飞机时 你确实正在被监禁
According to records, you were incarcerated at the time of the Cooper hijacking.

27:42.770 --> 27:47.990
我父亲和我  都有共同的缺点就是赚容易钱
My father and I share more than just a weakness for easy money.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.630
我们还有同样的名字
We also share a name.

27:49.640 --> 27:54.630
老查尔斯·韦斯特莫兰德  才是那天被监禁的人
Charles Westmoreland Senior was the one locked up that day.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.510
那么 你要不要钱?
Now, do you want the money or not?

27:56.520 --> 27:59.400
无意冒犯 但这有点太容易了
No offence, but it's a little convenient.

27:59.410 --> 28:01.900
你想加入 然后突然 你就变成那个人了
You want in, and suddenly you're the guy.

28:01.910 --> 28:03.860
我怎么确信你现在没撒谎?
How do I know you're not lying now?

28:03.870 --> 28:07.720
嘿 老头 别站在这里
Hey, Old Man River. Keep it moving.

28:42.410 --> 28:44.810
嘿 苏克雷...
Hey, Sucre.

28:45.900 --> 28:50.380
我对你和其他墨西哥人有个疑问
I got a question about you and the rest of the Mexicans.

28:50.390 --> 28:52.210
我认为我帮不上你
I don't think I'll be able to help.

28:52.220 --> 28:54.250
因为我是波多黎哥人
Seeing as I'm Puerto Rican.

28:54.260 --> 28:56.100
从地理上讲就那个意思 朋友
Geographical semantics, amigo.

28:56.110 --> 28:59.430
我是指那些有拉丁血统的人
I'm speaking about the general Latino population.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.030
那么本想来懒惰的人
How is it that a people so historically lazy

29:03.040 --> 29:07.240
为何会来到美国 成为体力劳动者的主力呢?
ended up being such a big part of the nation's workforce?

29:07.250 --> 29:11.400
依我看来 是美国人懒惰
The way I see things, it's everyone else that's lazy.

29:11.410 --> 29:14.580
不然 不会有那么多工作给移民的人
Otherwise, there wouldn't be jobs for the immigrants.

29:14.590 --> 29:18.990
那些坐在家里关心失业的人 懒人...
The ones sitting at home,collecting unemployment, the lazy ones...

29:19.000 --> 29:21.440
不是我们
it's not us.

29:23.410 --> 29:25.910
你让他这么说你们的人?
You gonna let him talk about your people like that?

29:25.920 --> 29:28.720
随便了 个人想法不一样
Whatever, Deliverance.

29:29.490 --> 29:31.770
你知不知道? 我们现在是一条船上的人
You know what? We may be a team in here,

29:31.780 --> 29:33.490
还有就是
but just so that you know:

29:33.500 --> 29:38.030
当我们逃出去那一刻  我们就要各顾各的了
The minute we get over that wall, it's every man for himself.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.700
或者比那还要早
Or sooner.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.740

你知道俄国人怎么杀人吗?
You know how the Russians do things?

30:10.890 --> 30:15.290
他们先让你活着 然后杀掉你全家
They let you live, and they kill everyone else in your family

30:15.300 --> 30:18.510
还有 所有你爱的人
and anyone you've ever loved.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.640
听起来怎么样?
How's that sound?

30:19.650 --> 30:22.220
-去死吧  -噢 来吧
-Go to hell.  -Oh, come on.

30:22.230 --> 30:25.520
女士不该这么说话吧?
Is that any way for a lady to talk?

30:27.320 --> 30:29.340
哦
What

30:30.320 --> 30:32.560
怎么 你以为我是笨蛋吗?
you think I'm an idiot?

30:32.570 --> 30:35.240
以为我会走到这井上面?
I'm just gonna walk into a well?

30:35.250 --> 30:38.690
别犯傻了 多诺万女士
Seriously, Ms Donovan...

30:46.360 --> 30:48.640
你还好吧?
You all right?

34:01.880 --> 34:03.870

否则 你今天早上的探监就是违法行为了...
Otherwise, your little visit to Fox River this morning would have been breaking the law.

34:14.170 --> 34:17.690
斯科菲尔德太太

移民局不会想知道你的那些准备好的故事
I don't want to know what you memorised for the INS.

现在 要么你回答我关于斯科菲尔德的问题
Now, you answer my questions about Scofield,

35:20.000 --> 35:23.150

或许他会问问有关于你的问题
And maybe he starts asking some questions about you.

你不能就这么把他留在这儿 他会死的

It's getting kind of testy in there, you know.

40:37.880 --> 40:40.210
我知道

40:41.630 --> 40:44.360
我要弄清楚一些事
I just needed to find something out.

What the hell's that?

40:45.930 --> 40:47.930

Listen.

40:53.290 --> 40:54.790
我是不是应该听见点动静?
Am I supposed to be hearing something?

18 minutes between each time

41:31.480 --> 41:34.900
时间间隔是18分钟
the guards pass the infirmary windows on their rounds at night.

41:34.910 --> 41:37.150
囚犯在晚上出不去
Cons aren't allowed out after hours.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.130
这是唯一找到时间间隔的方法
Only way I could find out the timing.

41:39.140 --> 41:42.820
