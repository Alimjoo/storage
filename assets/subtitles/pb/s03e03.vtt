告诉你那渔夫 书在斯科菲尔德的哥哥手上
Tell your fisherman friend Scofield's brother has this.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.790
放过惠斯勒吧
Just take the bounty off Whistler.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.390
惠斯勒对我而言没有利用价值
Whistler don't mean nothing to me, man.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.400
我可以帮上很多忙
There are ways I can be of assistance.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.700
惠斯勒现在清白了吧
Whistler's clear?

00:35.700 --> 00:37.400
和天空一样清白 兄弟
Clear as the blue sky, brother.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.400
那么我们怎么出去
So, how are we getting out of here?

00:39.800 --> 00:40.900
我也不知道
I have no idea.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.900
你在这干什么?
What the hell are you doing?

01:47.400 --> 01:48.300
我只是
I just

01:49.900 --> 01:51.700
我需要点钱 还有我
I need some money, and I didn't

01:51.800 --> 01:53.200
我也不知道可以去哪里
I didn't know where else to go.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.390
我有大概$50
I've got about $50.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.300
不
Nono.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.400
老兄 我指的是那几百万
I'm talking about the millions, papi.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.100
背包呢?
The backpack?

02:00.300 --> 02:01.990
所有的钱都在里面
There's all sorts of cash in that thing.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.800
需要个地方躲下 我帮你 但是背包没了
Need a place to crash,I got your back,but the backpack's gone.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.700
我的那份是给我弟弟的
Any money I dig out is for my brother.

02:08.000 --> 02:08.800
记得他吗
Remember him?

02:08.800 --> 02:10.900
高高的个子 有点瘦
Tall guy, kind of thin.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.600
帮你越狱
Busted your ass out of jail.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.600
我觉得欠他的情
I feel bad about Mike.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.100
真的 林肯
I do, Linc.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.300
不是所有人都可以被赦免的
But not all of us got exonerated, you know.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.390
非常清楚
Pretty clear on that.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.590
我现在甚至都不能回家
I can't ever go home again.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.190
你有麻烦吗 苏克雷?
You got problems, Sucre?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.300
林肯 不是只有你有麻烦
You ain't the only one,Linc.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.400
对
That's right.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.300
我们某种程度上都有罪
We're all guilty of something, man.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.500
我们所有人
All of us.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.300
但他们不是
Not them.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.300
我需要帮助
I want to help.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.400
但是看起来只是越陷越深
But it seems like it's only getting deeper and deeper.

02:38.100 --> 02:42.100
我只是想要些钱 然后重新开始
Look, I just, I just want money to get back on my feet and that's it, Linc.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.000
林肯
Linc?

02:46.100 --> 02:47.200
算了
Never mind.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.900
人性泯灭到兽性大发 用不了多久
Doesn't take too long for a man to become animal, no?

03:21.700 --> 03:23.900
聪明人会先去占他的床位
The smart ones go for his bunk first.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.700
那笨人会干嘛?
What do the dumb ones do?

03:27.900 --> 03:28.990
嘿 我先来的
Hey, I was here first.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.190
贱人 你来这才两天而已
Mampi bitch, you been here two days.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.990
我是说 我第一个拿到他的鞋的
I meant I was the first one to the shoe,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.190
你个装大胸的家伙 拿过来
you sack-in-the-box now hand it over.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.890
你是不是要个鸡爪来决斗
You're asking for a chicken foot, friend.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.200
想要鞋是吗
You want this shoe?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.400
那就放马过来吧
You're gonna have to come and get it.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.200
让他过来
Leave him. Leave him.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
我只是想表达我的谢意
I just wanted to express my thanks

03:53.500 --> 03:54.500
为
for, uh

03:56.200 --> 03:57.200
为惠斯勒的事
for Whistler.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.700
我不知道你在说什么
I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.

03:59.900 --> 04:00.900
对不起我的错
My mistake.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.600
另外 或许我们能重新做些安排
Anyway, I thought maybe we could make some kind of arrangement.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.600
也许我能
Maybe I could

04:04.700 --> 04:06.300
在这帮上什么忙
help out around Sona.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.300
过来哥们
Come here, boy.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.100
你们过去
Leave.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.600
你来帮我?
You help me?

04:19.900 --> 04:21.490
我是这的老大
I'm the bucky massa here, boy.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.400
是我 不是你
Me. Not you.

04:23.900 --> 04:28.300
任何人想在索纳监狱要东西 只能来找我
So if anyone want anything at Sona, it's me them will come to.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.390
所以不要到这来 说什么能帮忙
So do not walk in here asking for some favor

04:30.400 --> 04:33.700
好像我们有什么共识似的 不 没有
like we have some understanding. No, no, no, no, no.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.600
根本没有
We do not.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.200
小子 下次你再来这一套
The next time you roll in here like that, boy,

04:38.200 --> 04:41.400
你只能乞求我能仁慈点
the only thing you ask me for is mercy.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.500
明白了吗
Si?

04:44.400 --> 04:46.100
斯科菲尔德 有访客
Scofield, visitor.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.600
去吧 小子
Go on, boy.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.100
现在 去吧 你妈妈在找你呢
Now, run along, your momma calling ya.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.800
不妙 对吧
That bad, huh?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.300
很不妙
It's not good.

05:19.700 --> 05:20.400
你呢
You?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
我追查你从惠斯勒那得到信息
I followed that message you got from Whiler.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.090
全是关于一本书的
It's all about some book.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.890
鸟类导读 上面有名字和号码
A bird guide. Names and numbers on it.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.290
有关于他身份的线索吗
Any clues as about who he might be?

05:27.300 --> 05:30.500
还没 我们不是唯一在追查他的人
No. We weren't the only ones following his directions.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.400
他女友也在列 称他是个渔夫
His girl was there, says he's some kind of fisherman.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.000
对 最好他是
Yeah, sure he is.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.500
听着 伙计 我 我想给你看些东西
Listen, man, I, uh, I want you to check something out.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.700
我的天啊
Oh, my God

05:46.200 --> 05:47.090
她举着报纸的姿势
The way she's holding the paper

05:47.100 --> 05:48.190
就好像她在
it's like she's, uh,

05:48.200 --> 05:49.290
好像她在指着什么
it's like she's pointing at something.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.200
太小了 我看不清
It's too small I can't read it.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.390
是今天的报纸
This is today's paper.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.490
她指着圣丽塔
She's pointing at Santa Rita.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.900
那是离这20英里远的小镇
It's a small town 20 miles from here.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.100
她在试着告诉我们她在哪
She's trying to tell us where she is.

06:02.300 --> 06:03.390
我得跟她说话 林肯
I have to talk to her, Linc.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.790
就算他们让你跟她通话 伙计
Even if they let you talk to her, man,

06:04.800 --> 06:05.990
他们也会监听你的每字每句
they'll be listening to every word you say.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.690
你不能这么做
You can't do that.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.600
除了地名 我们还需要更多信息
We're gonna need more than the name of that town.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.500
我至今还是什么办法都没有 林肯
I'm coming up empty-handed here, Linc.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.300
已经3天了
It's already been three days and

06:16.100 --> 06:17.800
而我一筹莫展
I got nothing to show for it.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.400
所以 如果我不能把惠斯勒从这救出去
So, if I can't break Whistler out of here

06:22.300 --> 06:23.900
你必须得把他们从那救出来
you're gonna have to break them out of there.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.800
那么 计划是什么 伙伴?
So, what's the deal, mate?

07:01.400 --> 07:02.600
什么时候行动
When's moving day?

07:02.700 --> 07:05.100
你告诉我你是谁 我就告诉你计划
I'll tell you the plan when you tell me who you are.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.690
-我是个渔夫 -是吗
-I'm a fisherman. -Really?

07:06.700 --> 07:07.900
我也是
So am I.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.900
你还在担心我是否值得信赖?
You're worried about trusting me?

07:10.300 --> 07:11.990
我的命掌握在你的手里
My life is in your hands.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.900
我怎么知道我是不是该信任你
How am I supposed to know that I can trust you?

07:14.400 --> 07:15.100
你不要知道
You don't.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.600
斯图尔特·斯科特
Hey. Stuart Scott.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.990
一号 对吧? 你看体育中心吗?
Number one, right? You watch the SportsCenter?

07:27.000 --> 07:30.300
最近没有 听着 我需要打个电话
Not recently. Look, I need to get my hands on a phone.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.200
我还想要摸女人呢
I need to get my hands on some pechos.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.800
但是那是不可能实现的 对吧
But that ain't gonna happen either, is it?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.800
再说 谁那么重要 你必须得打给她
Who you got to call so important anyway?

07:37.800 --> 07:38.900
莎拉
Sara

07:40.700 --> 07:42.400
绝对不可能
Absolutely not.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.090
这不是个请求 而是命令
It ain't a request; it's a dictation of terms.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.200
我弟弟不会想办法越狱 除非他跟莎拉通话
My brother ain't thinking about escape till he talks to Sara.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.700
真甜蜜
Aw, that's sweet.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.400
我可以向你保证2件事 林肯
I can assure you of two things, Lincoln.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.090
第一 莎拉没事
One, that Sara's fine

07:53.100 --> 07:56.900
第二 你可以把我打翻在场
and two, you have a better chance of banging me on that bar

07:56.900 --> 07:58.400
但绝不能和她通话
than you do of talking to her.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.400
感谢你的提议 但是我拒绝
I appreciate the offer, but I'll pass.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.390
-确定? -确定
Yeah? Yeah.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.600
但如果这是个命令呢
Oh, what if that's a dictation of terms.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.390
这根本没有协商的余地
It's not a matter of negotiaon.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.000
政府把这里的电话拆了精光
Government rip out all the phones

08:07.200 --> 08:10.000
当发现这帮罪人在索纳监狱依然恶性不改
when they find out bad men in Sona still setting up deals.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.000
还像过去那样闹个不停
Making bang-bangs just like before.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.000
他们就把电话线切断了
They just did it over the phone.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.500
如果是切断线路的话 或许能修复
Well, if they cut the lines, maybe we can fix 'em.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.200
大哥 没什么好修的
There's nothing to fix, bro.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
这里以前沿着墙根都是成卷的电话线
There used to be a whole row of them all along the wall,

08:20.600 --> 08:21.700
但是现在都没有了
but they're gone now.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.090
如果你没有问题了
If you have no more questions

08:23.100 --> 08:24.190
我就走了
I'm just gonna get going.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.000
迈克两天内就救下了惠斯勒的命
Michael got the bounty off Whistler's head in two days.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.300
那是你们的人两周都办不到的
That's more than your people could do in two weeks.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.800
来点诚意吧
Show some goodwill.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.000
当他救出惠斯勒后 会得到的
He'll get his goodwill when Whistler's out.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.100
这点你必须了解下我弟弟
One thing you should know about my brother,

08:35.300 --> 08:36.700
那就是他很顽固
he's very stubborn.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.400
要想有收获 必须先付出
You want him to fetch, you throw him a bone.

08:39.800 --> 08:42.990
那么让迈克在狱内通个电话怎样?
How does Michael think he's gonna get his hands on a phone inside Sona?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.800
那手机呢?
What about cell phones?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.590
这边人来人往的 可以带个混进来
With all the traffic moving in and out of here.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.100
手机想都别想
Cell phone big no-no.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.890
只有一个人有权有手机
Only one man has access to it,

08:49.900 --> 08:52.100
而他绝不会给你这样的家伙用
and he would never let a zanahoria like you

08:53.800 --> 08:55.000
让我猜猜是谁
Let me guess.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.700
这是什么?
What is it?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.890
外头给你的本周行动指示
The weekly from your operations on the outside.

09:04.900 --> 09:06.400
低调行事
Grave digger dropped it off.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.000
这可办不到
That couldn't be.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.100
这薄薄的信封就打发我了
This envelope way too thin.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.800
东西运输上最近有点慢
Stuff just moving a little slow on the outside these days.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.500
是吗 东西运得慢
Oh, stuff moving slow.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.900
是故意有人磨时间吧
Somebody making it move slower.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.500
蒂博格
Teodoro.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.100
去楼下的理发师那边给我准备下
Set up something at the barber downstairs for me now.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.400
遵命 老大 没有问题
Yes, sir. No problem at all.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.000
告诉那贱货
You tell that bitch

09:41.600 --> 09:44.200
要是再用剃刀割到我 就要她好看
she nick me with the razor again, I'm gonna use it 'pon her.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.400
你还活着
You're still alive.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.200
你依然可爱动人
And you're still lovely.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.500
拜托 我都三天没洗澡了
Oh, please, I haven't showered in three days.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.100
不管你身上什么味 都是成熟味
Whatever you smell like, it's a significant upgrade.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.490
当我和你失去联系后 我
When I didn't hear from you, I

10:22.500 --> 10:23.600
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.800
-我提醒过你这会有些 -我知道 只是
I warned you it might be a bit I know, I know. It's just

10:30.100 --> 10:31.890
每次他们拖出尸身来
every time they dragged out a body

10:31.900 --> 10:32.800
看着我
Look at me.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.600
我向你保证 离开这后生活绝不会这样的
I promise you when I leave this place, it won't be like that.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.600
好吧
Okay.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.390
你找到我的书了吗?
Now, were you able to find my book?

10:40.400 --> 10:41.300
是的
Yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.790
但是有个家伙
But there was this guy.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.000
他跟踪了我
He followed me.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.200
怎么样的人?
What guy?

10:47.800 --> 10:48.600
我也不认识
I don't know.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
他有没有伤到你?
Did he hurt you?

10:50.400 --> 10:51.500
没有
No,

10:51.500 --> 10:53.800
但是他把书夺走了
but he took it.

10:53.900 --> 10:54.690
对不起 辜负你了
I'm sorry.

10:54.700 --> 10:55.690
我不知道该怎么办好
I didn't know what to do.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.400
他长什么样?
-What did he look like? -Um

10:57.800 --> 11:00.100
光头 块头很大
shaved head,kind of big.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.600
他让我告诉你 书在斯科菲尔德的哥哥手上
He said to tell you that Scofield's brother has it now.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.600
-斯科菲尔德是谁? -好吧
Who's Scofield? Okay.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.490
斯科菲尔德是谁?
Who's Scofield? Hmm?

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
没什么特别的
No one.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.490
他就是 和我一起工作的家伙
He's just, um he's someone I'm working with.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.000
他会帮我离开这里
He's gonna help me get out of here.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
他是律师吗?
He's a lawyer?

11:19.900 --> 11:20.800
基本上是吧
Basically.

11:22.700 --> 11:23.990
这就是为何你让他拿到书
That's why you want him to have the book.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.190
听着索菲亚 你知道的越少就越安全
Look, Sofia, the less you know about this, the safer you'll be.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.990
我知道的越少就越帮不了你
The less I know, the less help I'll be.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.100
说的没错
Exactly.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.690
我就想你回避一段时间行吗 宝贝?
I just need you to lay low for a while. Okay, sweetheart?

11:31.700 --> 11:33.400
詹姆斯 这到底怎么回事?
What the hell is going on, James?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.490
这书到底有什么玄机?
What is so important about this book?

11:35.500 --> 11:36.300
没有
Nothing.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.200
不过是有些笔记罢了
It just has notes in it,

11:39.300 --> 11:40.390
比如电话号码之类的
you know, phone numbers.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.100
也就是朋友的朋友 想法把我弄出去
It's people who know people who are going to help me get out of here.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.700
你在撒谎
You're lying.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.100
我为何要对你撒谎?
Why would I lie to you?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.800
你是我唯一能信任的人
You're the only person in the world that I can trust.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.300
过来点
Come here.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.800

Come here.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.800
现在我只要你信任我
Now, I just need you to trust me.

12:03.900 --> 12:04.800
然后呢?
And do what?

12:06.100 --> 12:06.800
没有然后
Nothing.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.800
请在这签下字
Sign out, please

12:39.400 --> 12:41.400
臭小子 你在找东西?
You looking for something, blanquito?

12:42.400 --> 12:44.190
是的 我在找
Yeah, yeah, I am, I am.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.600
你在找什么东西?
What you looking for then?

12:47.400 --> 12:50.800
就想找些 能消磨时间的东西
Just a little, uh little something to pass the time.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.900
你有钱吗?
You got paper?

12:56.300 --> 12:58.700
下楼去失物招领处找找
Go down to the lost and found with the rest of them.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.200
他们会让你满意的
They'll hook you up proper.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.100
行
All right.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.690
我发现你在别人的地盘找东西
I find you sniffing around where you don't belong,

13:03.700 --> 13:07.500
再这样 你就会和我去决斗
you'll find yourself in that ring again against me.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.500
你根本没有胜机
I don't like your odds.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.700
我给你看看这个
I want you to check something out, all right?

14:09.200 --> 14:11.600
看她的左手 好像在指着什么东西
Look at her left hand like she's pointing at something.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.900
你最好和我表弟说 让他准备好
Well, you'd better tell my cousin he'd better make himself available.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.200
他缺钱总比让我失去耐心要好
Better him short money than me short patience.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.800
听明白了?
No comprende, boy?

14:49.500 --> 14:50.600
手机要去充电
I need a charge.

14:51.900 --> 14:52.790
蒂博格
Teodoro,

14:52.800 --> 14:53.790
快去 给我准备好换洗衣服
go on, get me laundry, no?

14:53.800 --> 14:57.590
没问题 差点忘了 我和理发师说过了
Sure thing, boss oh, almost forgot. Uh, I talked to the barber.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.700
她下午两点能为您服务
She's gonna squeeze you in today around 2:00.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.400
老大 如果这能让你开心起来的话
If that pleases you, patrón.

15:03.800 --> 15:04.900
不错
Patrón.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.690
我觉得你该做出正确选择赎罪了
I think it's time you made good on all the bad you've done, Theodore.

15:15.700 --> 15:18.500
我们之间做个交易
You and me, we're going to make a deal.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.600
勒齐有个手机
Lechero has a cell phone.

15:20.700 --> 15:21.700
我需要那手机
I need it.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.890
没有问题
No problem.

15:22.900 --> 15:26.000
需要我在内部帮你做手脚?
Shall I turn water into wine while I'm at it?

15:26.200 --> 15:28.590
还是把那家伙的老妈给睡了?
Maybe give the guy's mother a good rodgering?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.590
她可能太老了 不对你胃口
She'd be a little old for your tastes, no?

15:30.600 --> 15:31.700
小心点
Careful, Pretty.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.290
别自己惹祸上身
Don't bite the hand you trying to get fed out of.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.890
我没有在找麻烦 我是在找寻帮助
I'm not looking for food, I'm looking for a favor.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.990
我干吗要帮你?
Why the hell should I do you a favor, huh?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.690
因为我不像他们 非常了解你的为人
Cause unlike your new compadres, I know who you are,

15:39.700 --> 15:42.100
知道你都干了什么 对谁干的
what you've done and who you've done it to.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.590
不如挑明直说了吧
Let me get this straight.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.800
你是说你想要告发我?
You're saying you gonna tell on me?

15:46.900 --> 15:50.300
我要说的是 这是个信教的国家
this here is a religious country,

15:50.800 --> 15:52.290
我宁可赌一把 看看巴拿马良民
and I'm willing to bet the good folks down in Panama

15:52.300 --> 15:54.800
会如何善待强奸犯
don't take too kindly to rapists

15:54.800 --> 15:57.100
兼恋童癖的
and pedophiles.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.800
你愿意和我赌上一把吗?
You want to bet against me?

16:19.100 --> 16:19.990
兄弟 听着
Listen, mate.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.800
这是我目前知道的情况
Here's what I know so far.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.090
我知道你的兄弟在外面想办法把我们弄出去
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,

16:24.100 --> 16:25.590
我还知道他跑去见我女朋友了
I know he ran into my girlfriend,

16:25.600 --> 16:28.000
还从她那里拿走了我的一本书
and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.

16:28.700 --> 16:29.900
把书还给我
I'd like it back.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.000
那本书有那么特别吗
What's so special about this book?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.690
除非能想办法出去
Well, unless it has directions out of this prison,

16:34.700 --> 16:36.800
我认为你不会真的在乎这本书
I don't think it should really matter to you.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.100
你根本不知道我在乎什么
You don't know what matters to me.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.600
我们出去了就把书还给你
You can get that book back when we get out of Sona.

16:43.000 --> 16:43.800
是吗?
Oh, yeah?

16:44.100 --> 16:45.190
那究竟啥时候我们能出去呢
And when the hell is that exactly?

16:45.200 --> 16:48.100
到现在为止 我根本看不出能逃出生天
Because so far I haven'seen bollocks in the way of breaking out of here.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.500
我来告诉你目前掌握的情况
Let me tell you what I know so far.

16:51.900 --> 16:52.490
有帮干尽坏事的家伙
Some very bad people who have done

16:52.500 --> 16:56.500
希望你活着
some very bad things want you alive

16:56.600 --> 16:59.790
并且从这里出去 我的良知告诉我
and out of this prison, which is why every bone

16:59.800 --> 17:01.700
我不应该帮他们把你弄出去
in my body is telling me to do the opposite.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.200
那你为啥还要这么做
Then why are you doing it?

17:04.900 --> 17:07.400
有人拿走了你的书你就不高兴了
You're upset because someone took a book from you.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.100
这是那帮家伙从我这里抢走的
This is what they took from me.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.700
所以 跟你直说了
So let's be clear.

17:12.300 --> 17:15.500
我在乎的是她 不是你
This is what matters to me, not you

17:16.100 --> 17:18.400
也不是你的什么书
and not your book.

17:32.710 --> 17:33.350
喂
Hello.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.020
表哥 还行吧
Cousin, how is it?

17:35.270 --> 17:36.420
你好啊 奥古斯特

17:36.520 --> 17:37.680
你说呢 兄弟
You tell me, man.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.490
生意就是那样 老大
Oh, business is cyclical, don dada.

17:40.590 --> 17:43.460
有时候好 有时候坏
Ebbs and flows, ebbs and flows, you know.

17:44.420 --> 17:46.970
看起来最近不怎么样啊?
Seems like there's more ebbing than flowing these days, huh?

17:47.000 --> 17:47.860
你说呢
You think?

17:49.180 --> 17:51.010
我跟你说说我的想法
I'm gonna tell you what I think, man.

17:51.660 --> 17:54.210
我看有个黑心鬼想抢走我的生意
I think a black heart is trying to steal my business.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.950
趁我不在的时候想干坏事了
Is taking advantage of my situation.

17:58.880 --> 17:59.410
我有没有说错啊?
If there are mistakes have been made,

17:59.420 --> 18:00.890
对我坦诚点
all I need is some honesty, man.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.000
不是这样的 我发誓
No mistakes, patron, I swear.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.870
那看起来问题不是出在你这儿了
Well, maybe the problem isn't on the outside.

18:08.860 --> 18:09.910
这么说问题就是
Maybe the problem is

18:11.260 --> 18:12.200
奥古斯特

18:12.760 --> 18:13.520
奥古斯特?

Battery dead.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.630

The bloodfire

18:23.680 --> 18:25.190
电话的插头为啥被拔掉了?
How me phone come unplugged? Huh?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.410
电池没电了

18:27.140 --> 18:28.520

19:24.570 --> 19:26.220
这算什么好消息
How the hell is that great news?

19:26.230 --> 19:28.150
对于外国公民来说
It usually takes two and a half years

19:28.160 --> 19:30.540
开庭通常需要等2年半的
for a non-citizen to get before a judge.

19:30.820 --> 19:33.600
我这里有个叫迈克·斯科菲尔德的人
I've got a guy in, in here, his name is Michael Scofield

19:33.610 --> 19:37.390
他愿意作证 是他嫁祸给我的

是他把毒品藏在船上的
and that he put the drugs on the boat.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.690
这些情况都会被考虑的
Which will all be taken into consideration

19:42.700 --> 19:43.890

请不要那么激动 马宏先生
I'm going to have to ask you to calm down, Mr. Mahone.

19:47.870 --> 19:49.020

你简直就是笨蛋 现在有人可以证明我
It's a no-brainer for you. I got a guy who can cop to The notion

19:50.740 --> 19:53.430
你讲的犯人甲代犯人乙承担罪责的主意

19:53.530 --> 19:54.820
在这里很常见了
isot exactly fresh

19:55.150 --> 19:56.240
而且通常只能说明那个人被迫
and usually means someone was pressured

19:56.250 --> 19:57.770
承认这些事情的
into the confession.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.040

Well, here's the thing, Raul.

20:01.730 --> 20:03.570

if, um, if I got this medication.

20:18.580 --> 20:19.560
你是在威胁我吗
Is that a threat?

20:19.570 --> 20:20.760
不是的
No.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.420
只是实际情况 这是
No, it's a reality, it's, it's

20:24.240 --> 20:26.750
这种药叫Varatril 如果你

21:12.060 --> 21:13.390
要带电话吗 老大
You want your cell phone, brother?

21:14.930 --> 21:16.750
不用了 半个小时就回来了
No, just be a half hour.

21:17.260 --> 21:18.320
电话留着充电吧
Leave it for charge.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.140
你有30分钟时间 26分的时候就还回去
You have 30 minutes 26 minutes he'll get back

21:38.150 --> 21:38.810
如果你不把电话
If that phone ain't back

还回充电座 我们都会完蛋 明白了吗?
on the cradle, we're both dead, you hear me?

21:39.900 --> 21:41.950
我不会一个人背这个黑锅的
Cause my Alabama ass is not going down alone.

21:44.060 --> 21:45.350

圣丽塔 这个地方可不小
Santa Rita ain't a one-horse town.

21:56.630 --> 21:57.680
我说 希望莎拉可以
I mean, God, I hope that Sara can give us

21:57.690 --> 21:58.850

LJ 莎拉
LJ Sara

33:50.950 --> 33:52.150
什么时候?
When?

33:55.650 --> 33:56.640
我找到那地方了
It was the right place.

33:56.650 --> 33:58.350
我只是没有及时达到那里
I just couldn't get to it in time.

33:58.450 --> 34:00.350
你看到他们了么? 他们好么?
Did you see them? Do they look all right?

34:00.850 --> 34:02.250
就我看到的而言 很好
As far as I could tell, yeah.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.350
那个你可以留着
You can keep that.

34:05.750 --> 34:06.540
把这作为纪念
Keep it as a souvenir

34:06.550 --> 34:08.150
当一切结束后送给莎拉
and give it to Sara when this is all done.

34:12.650 --> 34:13.950
Michael 我们可以做到
Michael, we can do this.

34:14.150 --> 34:15.640
不然他们不会费那么多精力
They wouldn't have gone to all this trouble

34:15.650 --> 34:16.340
把你弄到这里来
to put you in here

34:16.350 --> 34:17.850
如果不可能的话 他们也不会费尽周折
if it wasn't possible to get out.

34:19.050 --> 34:19.950
我们可以做到
We can do this.

34:21.250 --> 34:22.250
我们可以做到
We can do it.

34:49.950 --> 34:51.250
我想我们需要谈谈
I think we need to talk.

34:52.750 --> 34:53.940
你的朋友 照片中的那个人
Your friend, the one in the picture,

34:53.950 --> 34:55.550
你说是她是你在这里的原因?
you say she's the reason you're here?

34:56.750 --> 34:58.250
如此这般 我们就有共同点了
Then we have something in common.

34:59.150 --> 35:01.050
你哥哥在外面遇到的那个女人
The woman your brother met on the outside,

35:02.150 --> 35:03.450
她叫索菲亚
her name is Sofia.

35:03.650 --> 35:05.150
她是我在这里的原因
She's the reason I'm here.

35:08.050 --> 35:10.650
那好 除非这个索非亚也被枪指着
Well, unless this Sofia is being held at gunpoint,

35:10.750 --> 35:12.150
我们没有共同点
we got nothing in common.

35:12.650 --> 35:13.740
但是你也许可以告诉我
But maybe you can start by telling me

35:13.750 --> 35:15.750
为什么中情局对你这么感兴趣
why the Company's so interested in you.

35:15.750 --> 35:16.750
什么中情局?
What company?

35:20.450 --> 35:22.050
我没时间和你玩
I don't have time for games.

35:24.650 --> 35:26.950
好 好 听着
Okay, okay, look.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.240
我在这里和
Look, I've been splitting time between here

35:30.250 --> 35:32.040
西北太平洋之间跑船
and the Pacific Northwest running charters.

35:32.050 --> 35:32.740
捕鱼是吗
Fishing?

35:32.750 --> 35:33.340
对 捕鱼
Fishing,

35:33.350 --> 35:35.650
观光 只要可以赚钱的都干
sightseeing whatever was paying the bloody rent.

35:36.150 --> 35:37.840
一年前 我带了一个人出海
Now, abo year ago, I took a guy out.

35:37.850 --> 35:40.050
他是个自然科学家什么的
He was some sort of naturalist.He was, uh

35:40.050 --> 35:41.540
他采集水样测量
he was taking water samples, measurements.

35:41.550 --> 35:42.240
为了什么?
What for?

35:42.250 --> 35:43.150
我不知道
I don't know.

35:43.450 --> 35:45.440
我对此毫不关心
I didn't really care as long as the check cleared,

35:45.450 --> 35:46.240
但有件事情
but here's the thing.

35:46.250 --> 35:47.840
几个月后 我接到了一个电话
A few months later, I get a call from somebody

35:47.850 --> 35:49.450
想知道我带那人去了什么地方
wanting to know where I took the guy.

35:50.050 --> 35:52.250
我告诉他们我不记得了
And I told them I couldn't remember.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.150
但是后来
But then these, um

35:55.350 --> 35:57.040
政府模样的人
then these government types,

35:57.050 --> 35:59.750
他们来找我 开始问我问题
they started showing up at my flat asking questions,

35:59.750 --> 36:01.050
我不知道怎么做
and I didn't know what to do.

36:01.650 --> 36:04.050
所以我就躲了起来 就逃到了巴拿马
So I got low, I came down to Panama,

36:04.150 --> 36:05.750
我一直和索菲亚住在一起
and I moved in with Sofia full time.

36:06.050 --> 36:08.240
直到 酒吧打架事件的发生
Until Until the fight at the bar.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.350
是的 我最终到了这里
Yeah, and then I end up here,

36:10.550 --> 36:12.550
以前那帮人又来探视我
where those same people show up at visitation

36:12.550 --> 36:13.950
说他们会把我弄出去
saying they're going to get me out.

36:14.050 --> 36:16.140
作为回报 我把他们带回之前去的地方
And when they do, I'm to take them to the same place

36:16.150 --> 36:17.350
就是我带那个家伙去的那个地方
that I took that guy.

36:17.850 --> 36:19.550
这就是为何需要被你哥抢走的书的原因
That's why I need the book your brother copped.

36:19.850 --> 36:20.750
那是我航程日志
It's my trip log.

36:20.950 --> 36:23.340
我在空白处作了标记 坐标 路标之类
I write notes in the margins, you know, coordinates, landmarks.

36:23.350 --> 36:25.140
我需要循着原路返回
I need to retrace my steps and find that location.

36:25.150 --> 36:27.450
-我没有选择 -这真是个有趣的故事
I don't have a choice. That's a really interesting story,

36:28.050 --> 36:30.040
但是如果那本书真的如你所说
but if that book's as valuable as you say it is,

36:30.050 --> 36:31.650
我应该留着它
maybe I should hold onto it for a little while,

36:31.850 --> 36:33.550
直到我跟他们做完这个交易
make sure they hold up their end of the deal.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.050
你还不理解 是么?
You don't get this, do you?

36:35.250 --> 36:36.340
我需要时间去做
I need time to be able to

36:36.350 --> 36:38.650
我唯一要做的事情就是带你离开这里
The only thing I'm responsible for is getting you out of here.

36:40.950 --> 36:43.150
你们之间的事和我无关
Whatever's between you and them is between you and them.

36:43.350 --> 36:44.150
我很遗憾
I'm sorry

36:46.450 --> 36:47.350
没关系
All right.

36:49.150 --> 36:50.750
你想到该怎么做了吗
Do you have any idea how we're going to do this?

36:51.350 --> 36:53.550
我一直听说没人从这里出去过
All I keep hearing is how no one gets out of this place.

36:55.750 --> 36:57.150
我想我也听过
I think I've heard that one before.

37:02.450 --> 37:03.950
甘蔗好甜
The sugarcane's so sweet.

37:03.950 --> 37:05.950
芒果也很甜 女人也
The mangoes' so sweet, the women so

37:06.950 --> 37:09.250
如果这不是演艺人员
Well, if it isn't the entertainer.

37:09.450 --> 37:10.950
给我们说个笑话如何
How about a joke for us, boy?

37:11.050 --> 37:12.250
伙计 现在不是时候 我得
Not now, fellas, I got to get

37:12.250 --> 37:13.740
何不给我们跳个舞呢?
Why don't you do a little dance for us, huh?

37:13.750 --> 37:15.250
比如一段热舞?
How about a little jig, huh?

37:15.350 --> 37:16.550
或许你要借只手吧?
Maybe you need an extra hand?

37:19.050 --> 37:20.250
你说的真对
You got me.

37:21.150 --> 37:22.450
没错
Yeah, that's right.

37:22.550 --> 37:23.740
我知道你的伎俩
I do get you, boy.

37:23.750 --> 37:25.950
你骗得了他 但骗不了我
You might've fooled him, but you're not fooling me.

37:39.750 --> 37:40.650
老大 打扰了
Excuse me, boss.

37:41.650 --> 37:42.950
我让你别进来的
I asked you for privacy.

37:43.150 --> 37:44.850
我只是来
Just came in here to, to

37:45.850 --> 37:48.840
谢谢你让我在这里帮忙的
thank you for giving me a hand up in here,

37:48.850 --> 37:50.540
尽管如此 我只是想
but if it's all the same, I'd just like to be

37:50.550 --> 37:51.950
减轻我的责任
relieved of my duties.

37:51.950 --> 37:53.040
你在说什么?
Wh are you talking about?

37:53.050 --> 37:54.050
有些
There's some, um

37:55.050 --> 37:59.050
关于忠诚的问题 我还不想
loyalty issues going on, and I do not want to end up

37:59.550 --> 38:02.840
在我对你的忠诚和
torn between my fidelity to you and the reality

38:02.850 --> 38:03.940
被人指着鼻子的现实中做出取舍
of having to keep my nose clean.

38:03.950 --> 38:05.340
我很早就知道
I've been around long enough to know

38:05.350 --> 38:06.640
多米诺牌开始倒塌的时候
that when the dominoes start falling,

38:06.650 --> 38:07.940
往往会怪新来的人
it's the new guy that gets blamed

38:07.950 --> 38:09.050
撞到桌子
for bumping the table.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.740
你最好别拐弯抹角 有话直说
You better stop spinning and start talking straight.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.340
不
No

38:14.350 --> 38:15.350
我不是打小报告的人
I ain't no rat.

38:15.650 --> 38:17.350
我不是让你
I'm not asking you to be

38:18.950 --> 38:19.750
打小报告
a rat.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.150
我是让你做我朋友 好吗?
I'm asking you to be a friend, huh?

38:22.650 --> 38:23.650
就像我之前那样
As I've been with you.

38:26.650 --> 38:27.450
好的
Okay.

38:30.950 --> 38:32.340
早先我在散步
I was walking earlier,

38:32.350 --> 38:33.740
我听到一些声音
and I heard some voices talking

38:33.750 --> 38:36.040
让勒齐见鬼去吧
about,"To hell with Lechero.

38:36.050 --> 38:37.450
我想要我那份
I want my cut."

38:38.850 --> 38:40.040
我现在不能说他们是谁
Now, I couldn't tell who it was,

38:40.050 --> 38:42.440
但当我走到角落的时候 我发现
but when I got around the corner, I recognized the faces

38:42.450 --> 38:44.650
那些脸我很熟悉 我在这里见过
the very same faces I've seen in this room.

38:45.950 --> 38:48.840
我在这里得不到什么好处
Now, I got nothing to gain here, okay?

38:48.850 --> 38:49.540
我不是什么人物
I'm a nobody

38:49.550 --> 38:51.550
也成不了什么大人物
w-with no hope of being anyone.

38:53.050 --> 38:55.740
但你身边的人
But those that surround you have

38:55.750 --> 38:58.650
你下台后会得到一切
everything to gain if you fall.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.750
我想我们两清了
I hope this makes us even.

39:08.350 --> 39:09.450
但是我给你的
But what I've given you

39:10.450 --> 39:12.150
不是帮一个忙就能回报的
can't be repaid with one favor.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.150
所以我拒绝你的要求
So I deny your request,

39:18.250 --> 39:19.450
你可以继续跟着我
and you're going to stay on

39:20.450 --> 39:21.550
做我的耳目
as my ears.

39:21.850 --> 39:23.750
当我不在的时候
You'll report back to me everything you hear

39:24.850 --> 39:25.950
把你听到的都告诉我
when I'm not around.

40:04.350 --> 40:05.250
Michael 过的怎样?
How've you been, Michael?

40:06.250 --> 40:07.950
显然比某些人好
Better than some, apparently.

40:08.550 --> 40:09.640
你知道 这太有意思了
You know, it's interesting

40:09.650 --> 40:11.940
为什么你对你现在的住宿条件
how you don't seem rattled at all

40:11.950 --> 40:13.550
一点也不恼火?
by our current accommodations.

40:13.850 --> 40:16.540
是不是因为你觉得不会和他们在一起很久?
Could it be because maybe you're not planning on being in them much longer?

40:16.550 --> 40:17.840
阿历克斯 还是和我之前告诉你的一样
It's like I told you before, Alex,

40:17.850 --> 40:20.350
我们之间交情已了
this is the end of the line for both of us.

40:20.750 --> 40:21.650
那这样吧
How about this?

40:22.050 --> 40:23.350
我说错了你就不让我说
You stop me when I'm wrong.

40:23.650 --> 40:25.840
那个中情局要你活着留在巴拿马
The Company wanted you here in Panama alive,

40:25.850 --> 40:28.350
但是又诬陷你谋杀 而且是些奇怪理由
but framed for murder, and then for so for some strange reason

40:28.450 --> 40:30.940
你很在意那个惠斯勒的生死
you seemed to really care about the fate of this Whistler guy,

40:30.950 --> 40:31.740
我来告诉你一些事情吧
and I got to tell you something,

40:31.750 --> 40:33.550
他对你也很好奇
he's really curious about you, too.

40:33.550 --> 40:35.840
我们仔细想想 你有什么特殊才能让中情局
Let's see, what special talents do you have that the Company

40:35.850 --> 40:37.340
让中情局觉得你活着比死了
might make the decision that you're worth

40:37.350 --> 40:38.650
更有意义?
more to them alive than dead?

40:38.750 --> 40:40.040
迈克 你怎么回答?
Huh, what do you say there, Mike?

40:40.050 --> 40:41.040
我说到重点了吧
Am I getting warm yet?

40:41.050 --> 40:42.750
我想你该吃药了
I think you better pop another pill,

40:43.150 --> 40:44.150
因为全是胡扯
cause that's crazy.

40:44.250 --> 40:45.750
那么你不介意我杀了他吧
Oh, so you don't mind if I kill him?

40:46.250 --> 40:47.250
惠斯勒?
Whistler?

40:49.950 --> 40:51.750
我想问题在于"中情局到底在意什么?"
I think the question is,"What would the Company mind?"

40:52.050 --> 40:53.450
问题是"他们会对你做什么"
The question is,"What would they do to you?"

40:54.850 --> 40:55.950
对你所爱的人做什么
To the ones you love?

40:59.250 --> 41:00.750
阿历克斯 小心点
Be careful, Alex.

42:00.850 --> 42:01.750
忙碌的一天?
Busy day?

42:03.350 --> 42:04.950
没我希望的那样忙碌
Not as busy as I'd hoped.

42:05.050 --> 42:06.150
你想要试试
Look, you had to try.

42:06.450 --> 42:08.850
换作我 也会做跟你一样的事
I probably would've done the same thing myself if I were you.

42:09.950 --> 42:11.350
但是让我们彻底说清楚
But let's be perfectly clear.

42:12.550 --> 42:14.250
你以后都不可以再做这样的事
You're never going to try anything like that again.

42:16.050 --> 42:16.950
我明白
I understand.

42:17.550 --> 42:20.250
好 你最好真的明白了
Yeah, but just to make sure that you do,

42:20.950 --> 42:22.550
我给你留了点东西在车库里
I left you a little something in the garage.
