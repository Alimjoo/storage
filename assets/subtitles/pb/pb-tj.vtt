Someone tried to poison Sara today.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.480

只有你才会坏到
Only you would be depraved enough...

15:23.530 --> 15:26.690
认为杀害一个无辜的母亲  和她肚子里的孩子
...to think that killing an innocent  woman and her unborn child...

15:26.870 --> 15:29.990
能让你在死刑之前  获得一点宁静

莎拉怀孕了？
Sara is with child?

15:33.270 --> 15:35.040
恭喜

我以父亲对父亲的身份  求你放了她

不要动莎拉
But leave Sara alone.

15:52.930 --> 15:56.730
如果你被杀，痛苦只有一下子
...if you were killed,  your pain would last a moment.

15:57.100 --> 16:01.530
如果莎拉被杀  你会痛苦一辈子
lf Sara were killed,  your pain would last the rest of your life.

16:01.930 --> 16:06.740
这对那个动坏心眼的人来说  还蛮诱人的
Now, that's got to be appealing  to whoever put out this hit.

16:06.910 --> 16:08.600
但是别担心，麦可
But don't worry, Michael...

16:08.810 --> 16:12.240

我不会让你把我的监狱  变成福克斯河监狱
And l'm not gonna let you turn  my prison into Fox River.

Thank you for your time.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.440

17:34.930 --> 17:37.160
我想我们没有选择

17:52.780 --> 17:56.340
我为四十三位探员工作过

亚历山大曼宏是最干练、勇敢

18:03.060 --> 18:06.320
最正直的人  我很荣幸跟他共事过
...most honorable man l've ever had  the pleasure of serving with.

18:06.490 --> 18:12.290
身为四十三人的其中一个  我觉得有点冒犯
Well, as one of those 43 agents,  l can't help but feel a bit offended...

18:12.470 --> 18:17.230
因为我跟一个  有毒瘾的杀人犯一样正直
...because, obviously l am not as  honored as this drug-addicted murderer.

18:17.540 --> 18:20.370
亚历已经戒毒四个月了
Alex has been clean and sober  for four months.

18:20.540 --> 18:25.000
跟公司有关的罪刑已经一笔勾消
And he's been completely exonerated of  all crimes associated with the Company.

18:28.710 --> 18:31.010
然后把尸体埋在水盆下
...and burying his body  under the birdbath.

18:31.180 --> 18:33.080
这是凭空猜测
That is just an allegation.

18:33.250 --> 18:34.550
我们继续好吗？
Let's move on, shall we?

18:34.720 --> 18:37.350

亚历，这个裁定可以再议
You know, Alex,  this ruling can be revisited...

19:05.890 --> 19:08.250
如果你能证明

19:15.290 --> 19:19.030
现在关在迈阿密戴德州立监狱

19:19.200 --> 19:22.360
我们担心麦可史柯菲想把她弄出去
We have concerns that Michael Scofield  may have plans for her.

19:24.100 --> 19:28.400
这就是你们要我来的原因
So this--  This is why you invite me in here.

19:28.570 --> 19:31.240
如果史柯菲能够
Well, obviously,  if Scofield were to be able...

成功策划另一次越狱
...to pull off this plot  of another breakout...

19:34.010 --> 19:37.040
局里的脸就丢大了
...the public embarrassment  would be immense to the bureau.

如果有人能提供可靠的线索
So having someone to get us  credible information...

19:40.790 --> 19:42.810
对我们来说非常有用
...that would be worth something  to us.

19:43.020 --> 19:45.890
维特力探员会驻守迈阿密  他是你的联络人
Agent Wheatley is set up in Miami.  He would be your contact.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.150
你真厉害
You're something else.

19:56.770 --> 20:02.070
现在我们都知道  你多想回到原来的职务
Now, we both know  how badly you want that badge back.

20:03.540 --> 20:06.100
给我个理由让你复职
Give me a reason to give it to you.

20:07.180 --> 20:09.110
把她救出来后你有什么计划？
What's your plan  after we break her out?

20:09.280 --> 20:11.310
- 我们又要逃亡？  - 重要的事先做
-We on the run again?  -First thing's first.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.450
- 我们去救她出来  - 老大
-Let's get her out of there.  -Hey, papi.

逮捕莎拉的那个探员  在外面监视我们
The Fed that arrested Sara?  He's outside staking us out.

20:18.490 --> 20:21.320
如果你们担心又要趟入浑水

20:21.490 --> 20:23.660
就回去芝加哥  回到家人的身边
...go back to Chicago.  Go back to your family.

我会理解的
l'll understand.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.190
你说笑吗？
Are you kidding me?

20:26.370 --> 20:29.600
在我们经历这么多事后  难道我会不顾你跟莎拉？
After all we been through, l'm gonna  leave you here and Sara there?

20:29.770 --> 20:33.100
闭嘴，不要再提了  那些是什么？

20:40.110 --> 20:42.980
一个成功的案例都没有
None of them--  None of them successful.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.770

So we read them all  and we learn what not to do.

20:45.950 --> 20:49.510
监狱官员学了很多  他们重新评估改进
The prison officials learned a lot.  They re-evaluated, they retrofitted.

这座监狱根本没办法逃脱

好，如果我们进不去  那么下降的方式呢？
Okay, so if we can't go through,  what if we go down?

20:58.730 --> 21:01.030
我们跳伞进去，降到监狱中
Like, down into the prison.  We parachute in.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.170
- 好  - 没错
-Yeah.  -Yeah.

21:03.340 --> 21:05.130
- 找到她，带她出来  - 你在说笑？
-Find her, get out.  -Are you kidding?

21:05.300 --> 21:07.240
- 我是认真的  - 这根本是自杀
-l'm serious.  -That's suicide.

21:07.410 --> 21:10.530
我们只能从简报知道这么多
Hey, hey. Newspaper clippings  are only gonna get us so far.

21:10.710 --> 21:14.310
我们要知道更多监狱的讯息  我们去做点功课吧

- 迈阿密没有海洋世界  - 我的损失
-Sea World. There isn't one in Miami.  -My loss.

23:17.740 --> 23:21.730
不，如果你做蠢事  害你妻子被杀才是损失

23:22.110 --> 23:24.800
- 你威胁莎拉？  - 不，不是
-Are you threatening Sara?  -No, no. Not at all.

23:24.980 --> 23:27.810
如果你想撤销她的刑期
l'm saying if you were gonna try  and revoke her sentence...

23:27.980 --> 23:31.280
子弹可不长眼，麦可  不是她受伤就是你
...bullets fly, Michael. lf she were  to get hurt, that'd be on you.

23:31.450 --> 23:34.320
听到把她关入大牢的人  这么说还真好笑

23:34.490 --> 23:37.180
不，不是我关她  是佛罗里达州政府

我想你是个外科医师吧
l bet you was a hell of a surgeon.

25:08.580 --> 25:11.710
发保险套给囚犯  不会让你成为外科医师
Handing out condoms to cons  don't make you no damn surgeon.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.050
- 你有什么毛病？  - 你都没问过我

其实比较像疯婆子
Crazy type is more like it.

如果你不想加入
So, you know, if this ain't for you...

26:34.230 --> 26:35.630
那也没关系

26:39.510 --> 26:42.410
把那些脏油拿出去
Then you pick up that nasty oil  and take it out...

26:42.570 --> 26:44.200
倒在储藏器里
...and put it in the repository.

26:44.740 --> 26:46.210
好
Okay.

27:15.370 --> 27:17.670
我们走吧，老兄
We gotta go, bro.

27:18.110 --> 27:19.770
没关系，别哭了
lt's okay, just stop your crying.

27:23.750 --> 27:26.980
- 把你的手拿开  - 我满意就会放手
-Get your hands off me.  -When l'm good and ready.

27:27.290 --> 27:29.410
柏劳在围墙边做什么？
What's Burrows doing by the fence?

27:38.800 --> 27:41.730
别让我再问一次，莎拉
Please don't make me  ask you again, Sara.

27:53.410 --> 27:58.040
没有人会罩你，你要不要说实话？
Nobody here to help you but yourself.  Are you gonna answer me?

27:58.220 --> 27:59.650
你想杀我
You tried to kill me.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.820
排好队，回来
Line it up, cons. Back inside.

28:03.020 --> 28:06.010
回去做你的工作
You, get back to your detail now.

28:14.270 --> 28:16.100
过来这里
Right over here, baby.

28:26.450 --> 28:28.780
我要你跟你的朋友谈一项交易
l want you to pass along  an offer to your boy.

28:29.250 --> 28:33.310
他想找人在女监收拾丹奎迪
What he's paying his people to dust  that Tancredi chick in bitch pop...

28:33.490 --> 28:35.480
我马子打折帮他收拾
...my woman'll do it for a cut rate.

28:37.490 --> 28:40.080
你说的是打几折？
Just what kind of discount  are you proposing here?

28:40.860 --> 28:44.020
告诉他，如果原本出十万
Tell him  if he's offering a hundred grand...

28:44.200 --> 28:45.600
我马子三万就做
...my girl will take 30.

28:46.630 --> 28:48.160
不，四万
No, 40.

28:48.330 --> 28:49.490
四万
Forty.

28:50.300 --> 28:52.000
很好
Perfect.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.560
我会告诉他
l'll tell him.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.300
五星上将
Hey, five star.

29:04.350 --> 29:07.110
如果你没有现金
So you have no cash...

29:07.620 --> 29:08.640
一点也没？
...whatsoever?

29:09.890 --> 29:11.380
抱歉
l'm sorry.

29:11.590 --> 29:15.650
音响太吵我听不见
l couldn't hear you over the sound  of that broken record.

29:20.170 --> 29:21.790
知道了
Got it.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.800
我不会再问
l won't ask again.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.340
他就跟你看的一样笨
He was acting stupid as you look.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.520
怎么有这荣幸让您大驾光临？
Oh, to what do we owe the honor?

29:40.120 --> 29:41.550
我一直在想
l've been thinking.

29:41.720 --> 29:45.680
别害羞，直管说出来
Well, no need to be shy.  Just spit it out.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.720
- 我改变心意了  - 是
-Changed my mind.  -Yeah, well...

29:48.890 --> 29:50.420
或许老爹改变心意了
...maybe Daddy changed her mind.

29:52.260 --> 29:54.100
也许她不想收你了
Maybe she don't want you here  anymore.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.560
她说的没错
Squirt's right.

29:55.730 --> 29:58.600
我已经收回我的善意
l recently have rolled up  my welcome mat.

29:58.770 --> 30:00.400
保重
Peace.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.210
拜托
Please.

30:08.380 --> 30:10.080
拜托什么？
Please what?

30:12.050 --> 30:14.850
让我加入家庭
Please may l be a part of your family?

30:17.890 --> 30:19.550
出去走走
Take a walk.

30:20.230 --> 30:21.450
出去走走
Take a walk.

30:28.030 --> 30:31.300
我很欢迎  坐下，我真的是
l would love that. l would--  Sit down. l really would.

30:31.900 --> 30:34.810
但没这么简单
But see, it's not that easy...

30:34.970 --> 30:37.460
说个我愿意就好
...as just saying ''l do.''

30:40.110 --> 30:41.980
你要许下诺言
See, you're making a commitment...

30:42.680 --> 30:43.810
对家忠心不二
...to a family.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.820
你必须证明
lt's something you gotta prove.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.890
没错，我们都做过
That's right. We all did it.

31:06.340 --> 31:10.100
这是对家徽的承诺
lt's a commitment to the family coat.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.840
你必须戴上这个家徽
lt's a coat you gotta wear.

31:35.100 --> 31:37.190
- 亚历  - 是你
-Alex.  -Hey.

31:37.370 --> 31:39.300
- 什么事？  - 苏克
-What's up?  -Hey, Sucre.

31:39.470 --> 31:42.370
- 你好吗？  - 怎么了？
-How you doing, man?  -What's going on?

31:42.940 --> 31:43.970
我们谈谈
We gotta talk.

31:45.440 --> 31:46.470
好
All right.

31:47.180 --> 31:48.270
他们在监视你
They're watching you.

31:48.780 --> 31:51.980
- 我们知道，有一个探员在跟我们  - 不，不只一个
-We know. We got a Fed on us.  -No. Not just one.

31:52.150 --> 31:53.210
是整个部门
The whole department.

31:53.390 --> 31:56.050
听起来像是内线消息，亚历
Sounds a lot like inside information,  Alex.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.520
你怎么做，跟他们谈条件？
What'd you do,  make a deal with the Feds?

32:00.360 --> 32:03.450
如果我来监视你  他们就让我复职
They offered me my job back,  if l came down here to spy on you.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.830
你说的探员是维特力
The Fed you're talking  about is Wheatley.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.400
- 他主导计划  - 我们现在知道了
-He's running point.  -So now we know.

32:09.570 --> 32:11.900
如果你真的要做
So if you're really gonna do this...

32:12.300 --> 32:13.500
就要做好
...you gotta do it right.

32:14.670 --> 32:16.870
如果你需要，我会帮你
And l'll help you if you need me.

32:19.680 --> 32:20.980
还有什么消息？
What else did you get?

32:21.150 --> 32:24.380
莎拉今天四点在修车厂工作
Sara was working motor pool today  at 4:00.

32:24.550 --> 32:25.680
修车厂在这里
Motor pool is here.

32:25.850 --> 32:29.050
在监狱的范围有两个摄影机监视
visible by two security cameras,  along the perimeter of the prison.

32:29.220 --> 32:33.420
- 有其他的入口？  - 没有卸货区，没有员工入口
-What about secondary entrances?  -No loading dock, no personnel entrance.

32:33.590 --> 32:37.150
- 围墙呢？  - 十五尺高，有刺网
-Fences?  -Fifteen feet high, covered in razor wire.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.320
- 有通电？  - 没有，为什么问？
-Electrified?  -No, why?

32:39.500 --> 32:42.160
如果莎拉能回到修车厂
lf Sara can get herself back  to motor pool...

32:42.330 --> 32:44.000
我们就可以找方法进去
...we can find our way inside.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.690
翻修以后围籬线加宽了
With all the retrofits,  the fence line was widened...

32:47.870 --> 32:51.040
但监视摄影机还是没变
...but security cameras remain  exactly where they've always been.

32:51.210 --> 32:53.800
- 没有想到做了改变  - 有盲点
-Never accounted for the difference.  -A blind spot.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.370
没错
Yeah.

32:55.550 --> 32:59.040
这里，如果莎拉可以回到那里  我们就可以破坏围籬
Right here. lf Sara can get back  to that spot, we can breach the fence.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.340
风险很大，麦可
lt's risky, Michael.

33:00.890 --> 33:04.250
只能这样做，我们要告诉莎拉  在哪里碰头
lt's all we've got. We have to tell  Sara where we're gonna meet her.

33:04.420 --> 33:07.190
怎么做？我们不能探视  也不能打电话
How? We get no visitation,  no phone calls.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.430
这没问题，拿给丹奎迪
lt's clean. Take it to Tancredi.

33:39.590 --> 33:41.790
记得我教你关于花朵的时刻
Remember when I taught you  about flowers.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.830
我盼望此刻在你身边
I wish I was with you now...

33:44.000 --> 33:46.360
看你手中握着一朵花儿
...to see you holding one in your hand.

33:51.940 --> 33:54.060
看你手中握着一朵花儿
To see you holding one in your hand.

34:10.520 --> 34:13.650
明天，下午，七点，废油槽
Tomorrow, p.m., 7. Oil dump.

34:34.980 --> 34:38.210
- 看来你一直很忙  - 你有搜索令吗，维特力探员？
-Looks like you've been busy.  -You have a warrant, Agent Wheatley?

34:38.680 --> 34:40.450
搜索令？我不用
A warrant? No, l don't need one.

34:40.620 --> 34:44.320
我会说是你兄弟让我进来
My testimony will be  that your brother let me in, once inside...

34:44.490 --> 34:47.520
一进来就刚好看到这些证据
...saw all this evidence,  right in plain sight.

34:47.690 --> 34:49.720
哪个法官会信你的鬼话？
What judge is gonna take your word?

34:49.930 --> 34:52.950
什么证据？  这些都是公共建筑的照片
What evidence? Those pictures  were taken from public property.

34:53.130 --> 34:55.960
监狱的资金是纳税人的钱
That prison was paid for  by the taxpayers.

34:56.130 --> 34:59.040
你的证据只有一个无罪的市民
So all you have evidence of  is an exonerated citizen...

34:59.200 --> 35:02.900
站在马路上拍摄公共建筑的照片
...standing on a public road taking  pictures of a public building.

35:03.070 --> 35:04.970
这应该不算是犯罪吧
Last l checked, it's not a crime.

35:05.140 --> 35:07.130
如果我说你有企图呢？
What if l said l could get you  on attempt?

35:07.310 --> 35:08.800
你有这些东西
Just for having all this stuff.

35:08.980 --> 35:12.040
如果我说这是表现善意的礼物？
What if l told you that all of this  was a peace offering?

35:12.220 --> 35:14.690
典狱长不让我见我妻子
The warden  won't let me see my wife.

35:14.850 --> 35:17.320
如果我找到一些安全漏洞
So l figured if  l found a few lapses in security...

35:17.490 --> 35:20.930
然后善意的告知  或许她会改变心意
...pointing them as a gesture of good  faith, she might change her mind.

35:21.090 --> 35:22.650
是这样吗？
ls that so?

35:22.830 --> 35:26.260
- 你有发现什么？  - 没有，密不透风
-You find anything yet?  -Nope. Looks airtight.

35:26.460 --> 35:28.090
你确定？
You sure about that?

35:28.400 --> 35:32.270
没有混蛋可以混进去的地方？
Nothing that some scumbag  can exploit?

35:33.840 --> 35:35.170
密不透风
Airtight.

35:35.340 --> 35:36.860
真是谢天谢地
Well, thank goodness for that.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.110
如果想到什么  你们会跟我说吧
But you guys will let me know  if anything comes up.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.970
第一个就告诉你
You'll be the first to know.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.110
放你一马
l won't keep you.

35:59.300 --> 36:01.890
在外面，我以说到做到闻名
On the outside l was known  for getting the job done...

36:02.070 --> 36:03.190
不管发生什么事
...no matter what.

36:03.370 --> 36:04.700
我的报酬很丰厚
l got paid well for it.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.860
现在我身无分文
Now l'm broke.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.470
但我还是需要些东西
But l still need things.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.110
像是什么？
Like what?

36:10.280 --> 36:13.570
- 帮忙  - 我不帮犯人的忙
-A favor.  -l don't do favors for cons.

36:13.750 --> 36:14.770
真的？
Really?

36:14.950 --> 36:17.240
浴室的墙壁可不是这么说
That's not what it says  on the bathroom wall.

36:17.420 --> 36:18.940
据我了解
As l understand it...

36:19.120 --> 36:22.310
会回报的人你都会帮
...you do favors  for those who reciprocate.

36:26.060 --> 36:27.390
真的吗？
ls that true?

36:34.430 --> 36:35.560
干嘛
Hey.

36:35.730 --> 36:37.100
这根本不算什么，老大
This is bush league, boss.

36:38.470 --> 36:39.960
我是不死老兵

36:40.140 --> 36:41.970
你我
You-- l--

36:42.140 --> 36:44.440
没有理由翻我的东西

You know me!

36:51.550 --> 36:52.950

Lookie, lookie here.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.590
那包海洛因不是我的，你很清楚
No. That brown ain't mine,  boss, you know this.

36:55.750 --> 36:57.690
我不吸毒
l don't do no drugs.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.480
是谁栽赃我？
Who put that in here?

37:00.860 --> 37:01.920
你
You--

37:02.090 --> 37:04.820
放手，我知道在哪里关禁闭
Get your hands off me.  l know where the hole is.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.660
你看什么看

37:07.070 --> 37:08.760
我不吸毒

37:11.370 --> 37:13.200
这件事有人要倒大霉了
Somebody's going down for this.

37:13.410 --> 37:14.930
我也爱你
l love you too.

37:16.070 --> 37:18.300
苏菲亚在中美洲做了安排

37:18.480 --> 37:21.670
一旦救出莎拉就上船消失
Once we break Sara out,  we're on a boat, and we're gone.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.610

37:24.780 --> 37:26.310

他们会监听，你要小心
They're gonna be listening.  You gotta be careful.

如果她看懂我的信  就会想办法告诉我
lf she understood my letter,  she'll find a way to tell me.

关于阁楼里的照片和图样  我想了很多

40:09.150 --> 40:12.050
就在沿着围籬过去的那边  是翻修工程的漏洞
Right along the fence line over here,  due to a retrofit.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.780
你应该不知道吧？
You didn't know about this, did you?

40:14.950 --> 40:16.010
不知道
No.

40:16.190 --> 40:19.990
如果你知道  早就告诉我和典狱长了吧？
No, because you would've told me  or the warden about it if you did, right?

40:20.460 --> 40:22.820
还好我提早发现
Well, it's a good thing l found this  when l did...

40:22.990 --> 40:25.330
现在还没人逃出去
...before anyone tried to escape.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.020
进来
Coming in.

40:38.540 --> 40:41.980
如果我们跨越不了围墙  就要往地下或天空发展
Well, if we can't go through the fence,  then that leaves under or over.

40:42.150 --> 40:44.910
她要怎么爬铁丝网而不被抓？
How's she gonna climb  that fence without being seen, huh?

40:45.080 --> 40:48.080
我想没有电话线可以让她爬过去
l'm guessing there's no telephone  wire for her to climb across.

40:48.290 --> 40:49.550
那她就得从地下出来
Then she's gotta go under.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.380
好吧，我们去买铲子
All right, let's get some shovels.

40:51.560 --> 40:53.720
你说降落伞怎样？
What's that you were saying  about parachutes?

40:53.890 --> 40:55.150
降落伞？
Parachutes?

40:55.330 --> 40:56.590
别闹了
Guys, come on.

40:56.790 --> 40:59.730
- 你不可能跳伞？  - 有几个问题
-You can't be s-- Parachutes?  -A couple of thoughts on that.

40:59.900 --> 41:02.890
我们没有飞机也没有驾驶
A, we don't have a plane.  B, we don't have a pilot.

41:03.070 --> 41:05.370
- 你有跳过伞？  - 别担心
-Have you ever worn a parachute?  -Don't worry.

41:05.540 --> 41:07.510
我有计划
l think l've got a plan.

41:07.670 --> 41:09.900
我们需要老朋友帮忙
We're gonna need some help  from an old friend.

41:10.410 --> 41:11.600
谁？
Who?

41:11.810 --> 41:14.110
你要我帮忙？
You want a favor from me?

41:14.310 --> 41:15.400
听我说
Just hear me out.

41:15.580 --> 41:19.610
当然，你和麦可送我回监狱时
Of course. l mean, when you and  Michael sent me back to that prison...

41:19.820 --> 41:21.880
的确有给我一片口香糖
...you did give me the piece  of chewing gum.

41:22.050 --> 41:24.850
如果不能回报，我还算什么？
What kind of man would l be  if l didn't quid your pro quo.

41:25.020 --> 41:28.790
你只需要引发火警铃
Look, all you gotta do  is set off the fire alarm in here.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.390
明晚七点三十分
Tomorrow night, at 7:30.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.190
就这样
That's it.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.400
你要救她出去？
You're breaking her out.

41:35.570 --> 41:37.540
克伦札要杀她
Krantz has put a hit on her.

41:37.700 --> 41:39.900
这是我们唯一的机会
lt's our one shot...

41:40.540 --> 41:42.270
能够救她
...of keeping her alive.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.930
这里是插翅难飞，林克
Well, you're in a pickle covered in jam,  Lincoln.

41:45.110 --> 41:48.100
事成之后会给你五千
We'll put 5 grand in your kit  once this whole thing jumps off.

41:48.880 --> 41:52.370
麦可一生的爱只值五千？
The love of Michael's life,  that's only worth $5000?

41:52.550 --> 41:54.280
我们只有这么多
That's the best we can do.

41:54.620 --> 41:57.250
- 我要六位数  - 我们只有这么多
-l need six figures.  -That's all we got.

41:57.420 --> 42:00.720
你真幸运，我刚好知道谁有
Well, lucky day for you,  l know somebody who does.

42:00.890 --> 42:02.090
将军的手下
The general's man.

42:04.460 --> 42:07.450
他要拿钱付莎拉的杀手
He's got the payout for Sara's hit.

42:07.800 --> 42:11.390
明天晚上七点前汇给我
You wire that money to me  by 7 p.m. tomorrow...

42:11.570 --> 42:14.230
- 我就帮你  - 他叫什么名字？
-...and we're in business.  -What's his name?

42:14.410 --> 42:17.470
- 叫你的兄弟利用他  - 给我多点时间
-Get your brother to use that noggin.  -You gotta give more.

42:17.640 --> 42:20.240
明天晚上七点，去拿钱吧
Tomorrow at 7 p.m. Go on, fetch.

42:38.260 --> 42:40.250
你还真难相处
You're a tough girl to get alone.

42:40.430 --> 42:43.260
我知道他要来救你  我要跟你走
l know he's breaking you out.  l'm coming with you.

42:49.710 --> 42:51.200
别紧张
Relax.

42:51.410 --> 42:52.840
克伦札要我杀你
Krantz sent me to kill you...

42:53.010 --> 42:55.310
但他那样对我，我不再听他的话
...but after what he's put me through,  l'm done.

42:55.480 --> 42:57.350
我中毒时，你在我旁边
You were next to me  when l was poisoned.

42:57.520 --> 43:00.640
如果我要你死，你还能活那么久？
You think you would've lasted  this long if l wanted you dead?

43:00.820 --> 43:02.290
我要你死，你还是活着
l want you dead. You're alive.

43:02.450 --> 43:05.350
你如果知道谁要搞你  就很难活下去
lt's hard to stay alive when you know  who's coming after you.

43:05.520 --> 43:08.150
这边有二百个女囚
There's 200 women in this prison.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.120
你以为你逃得出去？
Could you even get out of gen pop?

43:15.500 --> 43:16.730
我跟你去
l'm coming with you...

43:17.670 --> 43:19.470
要不然谁都别想出去
...or nobody's going.

43:47.100 --> 43:48.860
你该看看麦可的表情
You should've seen Michael's face...

43:49.030 --> 43:51.970
当他看到我修围籬，架摄影机
...when he saw me fixing that fence,  installing that camera.

43:53.570 --> 43:55.540
你做的很好
You did a great job.

43:56.170 --> 43:58.510
工作完成了
Well, the job's over now.

43:58.880 --> 44:04.210
如果麦可误信莎拉命在旦夕
lf Michael has this misguided belief  that Sara's life is in danger...

44:04.380 --> 44:06.610
他还是会找法子救她
...he's gonna find a way back  into that prison.

44:06.780 --> 44:10.980
除非找到证据将他抓起来  否则你的工作就没完
Your job won't be over until you give  us evidence to put him back behind bars.

44:12.620 --> 44:13.720
最新的动静如何？
So, what's the latest?

44:14.630 --> 44:16.390
还没具体的行动
There's nothing concrete.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.760
我有消息就告诉你
But l'll let you know  when l get something.

44:18.930 --> 44:20.190
好的
All right.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.420
很好
Good man.

44:48.130 --> 44:50.590
如果你看到这影片
Well, if you're watching this...

44:50.760 --> 44:54.430
我很高兴，因为这代表你很安全
...l'm glad  because that means you're safe.

45:02.840 --> 45:05.930
- 他要怎么做？  - 从飞机往外跳
-How does he think he's gonna do this?  -Jump out of the plane.

45:06.110 --> 45:09.640
- 我知道他要跳，但他能着陆吗？  - 不可能不被抓
-l know he's gonna jump. Can he land?  -Not without getting caught.

45:09.810 --> 45:12.480
他要怎么逃出牢房？  即使茶包
How's he gonna get out of the cellblock?  Even if T-Bag--

45:12.650 --> 45:16.640
这是大疑问，疯了才会相信茶包
lt's a big ''if.'' Trusting T-Bag is crazy.

45:17.190 --> 45:20.180
麦可，我们真的要重新计划
Michael,  we really have to rethink this.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.620
我想过了，没别的方法
l have. And there's no other way.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.530
我降落在这个外围区域
Okay, l'm gonna drop down  into this outer area here.

45:27.700 --> 45:30.290
在别人抓到我之前  我会切断降落伞
l'll cut the parachute off  before anyone can reach me.

45:30.470 --> 45:31.870
他们一定会抓到你
They're gonna be on your ass.

45:32.070 --> 45:36.270
我躲在这栋建筑之后  等待时机我就会到这里
l can hide behind this building, wait for  a window. l'll make my way over here.

45:36.440 --> 45:40.170
那是教堂，希望莎拉能在那等
That's the chapel where, hopefully,  Sara will be waiting.

45:40.340 --> 45:41.680
为什么是教堂？
Why the chapel?

45:41.850 --> 45:45.150
在暴动的时候  员工可以从行政大楼逃出去
During a riot, prison employees  escaped through the admin building.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.780
他们受伤倒在那里  就在围墙外
They wound up here,  outside the fence.

45:47.950 --> 45:51.620
行政大楼跟教堂相接
The administration building  is connected to the chapel...

45:51.790 --> 45:56.160
也就是在那道围场中  有个秘密出口
...which means that somewhere in that  compound, there's a subterranean exit.

45:56.330 --> 45:58.390
如果我们能穿越
lf we can get through it...

45:58.600 --> 45:59.820
你可以在这里等我们
...you can meet us there.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.730
- 莎拉要怎么到教堂去？  - 她会找到方法的
-How's Sara gonna get to the chapel?  -She'll have to find a way.

46:04.300 --> 46:08.000
我们按照计划明天晚上七点执行
Look, we're doing this at 7 p.m. tonight,  just like we planned.

46:08.710 --> 46:10.540
你去哪了？
Where've you been?

46:10.710 --> 46:11.830
我错过什么？
What did l miss?

46:12.010 --> 46:16.570
我要你去找飞机和驾驶  我要你们去解决茶包的事
l need you to find a plane and a pilot.  l need you two to take care of T-Bag.

46:16.750 --> 46:20.210
找出是谁有这笔钱  他们藏在哪里
Find out exactly who has this money  and where they're keeping it.

46:20.380 --> 46:23.250
- 我们要拿到钱  - 今晚七点以前
-And then we have to get it.  -By 7 p.m. tonight.

46:26.390 --> 46:27.910
不然莎拉就死定了
Or Sara's gonna die in there.

46:29.630 --> 46:31.820
- 大家准备好了？  - 是的
-ls everybody onboard?  -Yeah.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.390
好
Okay.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.640
告诉我你完成任务了
Tell me you completed  your assignment.

46:42.210 --> 46:46.010
我拿到现金  但是送到可能会拖一下
Well, l've got the cash, but there may be  some delay with final delivery.

46:46.180 --> 46:49.670
那女人没办法接近莎拉丹奎迪
The woman we hired is having trouble  getting near Sara Tancredi.

46:49.850 --> 46:53.180
找别人去，谁都可以，把赏金拉高
Hire somebody else. Call it open season.  Put a bounty on her head.

46:53.350 --> 46:58.850
我不管你怎么做  我要莎拉丹奎迪活不过今晚
l don't care how you do it. l want Sara  Tancredi dead by the end of the day.

47:00.220 --> 47:03.660
放封，一小时
Open cell. One hour.

47:15.910 --> 47:17.930
我们要玩牌，你要玩吗？
Yo, we about to play cards.  Do you want in?

47:20.040 --> 47:21.570
不要，谢谢
l'm okay. Thanks.

47:21.750 --> 47:23.040
你应该要玩
You should.

47:23.550 --> 47:25.780
老爹走了，你需要有人罩你
With Daddy gone,  you gonna need your backup.

47:28.620 --> 47:30.090
我们都需要
Hell, we all do.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.290
我怀孕有事
l've got a prenatal thing.

47:34.790 --> 47:36.920
- 没关系  - 谢了
-lt's cool.  -Thanks.

47:37.090 --> 47:40.290
有人出赏金要杀你  这样真不太聪明
Not too smart though for a girl  with a bounty on her head.

47:42.470 --> 47:44.060
还是你没听到？
Or ain't you heard?

47:46.440 --> 47:49.130
丹奎迪，你有访客
Tancredi, you have a visitor.

47:51.280 --> 47:53.970
替我跟你老公问好
Say hello to your husband for me.

48:06.590 --> 48:08.350
怎么了？
What's wrong?

48:10.130 --> 48:11.820
听着
Look...

48:12.830 --> 48:16.660
我知道这里发生的事你没办法控制
...l know you don't have any control  over what's happened here...

48:18.370 --> 48:20.500
但事情不太顺利
...but things aren't working out.

48:21.970 --> 48:23.740
好吧
Okay.

48:27.310 --> 48:31.270
我一直在想办法去
l've been trying to find a way to do...

48:31.550 --> 48:33.280
做这件事
...this...

48:34.150 --> 48:37.710
但现在我们只有一个选择
...but from where we stand right now,  there's only one option.

48:37.890 --> 48:40.150
你需要多点时间想想？
Do you need more time to think?

48:40.690 --> 48:43.490
不，不是这样
No. No, it's not about that.

48:43.660 --> 48:45.750
我已经想好了
I've made up my mind...

48:46.200 --> 48:48.890
你没办法帮什么忙
...and there's really nothing  you can do about it...

48:49.470 --> 48:53.030
只能今晚帮我们祈祷
...except pray for us tonight.

48:53.840 --> 48:55.400
帮我们祈祷？
Pray for us?

48:57.210 --> 48:59.400
我们可以祈祷相聚
You can pray for us to be together.

49:00.340 --> 49:02.510
或许我也会这么做
Maybe l'll do the same.

49:06.480 --> 49:09.540
如果我不知道是什么人  要怎么抢他？
How can l rob someone  if l have no clue who he is?

49:09.720 --> 49:13.590
外面的簿子说  克伦札昨天有一个访客
The log book outside says  that Krantz had one visitor yesterday.

49:13.790 --> 49:15.020
乔丹尼尔
A Joe Daniels.

49:15.190 --> 49:18.990
以推论来说  丹尼尔就是你们要找的人
Well, using the power of deduction,  l'd say Daniels is your bagman.

49:19.160 --> 49:22.600
你知道迈阿密有几个丹尼尔？  上千个，我要多点讯息
You know how many Daniels  live in Miami? Thousands. l need more.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.030
那你最好快点
You better get cracking.

49:24.200 --> 49:27.530
因为如果我七点前拿不到钱  你就别想我会触发火警铃
Because if l ain't got that money  by 7:00, you ain't got your fire...

49:27.710 --> 49:31.040
我没触发火警铃  王子就找不到公主了
...you ain't got your fire alarm.  Pretty ain't got his Mrs. Pretty.

49:31.210 --> 49:34.510
我的朋友  你没有立场要求
Listen, my friend,  you're in no position to make demands.

49:34.710 --> 49:36.540
好吧
Okay.

49:37.080 --> 49:39.710
我不是在乞求成交
l ain't talking about backing out  of the deal.

49:39.880 --> 49:42.580
我会想办法弄点消息
l'll put my ear to the ground,  come up with some details.

49:42.750 --> 49:44.120
很好
Good.

49:44.820 --> 49:46.050
那就快去
Then go fetch.

49:53.730 --> 49:54.760
找到驾驶了
We got a pilot.

49:55.700 --> 49:58.830
我二十年前逮到这家伙  运毒越过波斯湾
lt's a guy l busted 20 years ago,  running drugs across the gulf.

49:59.200 --> 50:01.190
改邪归正，现在做包机事业
Went legit,  runs a charter business now.

50:01.370 --> 50:04.540
- 你应该跳过飞机吧？  - 有几次
-You must've jumped out of planes, huh?  -Yeah, several.

50:04.710 --> 50:08.940
有些是运动，有些是需要  有很大的不同，麦可
Some for sport, some necessity.  lt's a big difference, Michael.

50:09.110 --> 50:12.080
想降落在预计的目的地可没那么容易  尤其是晚上
lt's not easy hitting the X,  especially at night.

50:12.250 --> 50:14.910
没问题，我可以自己来
Don't worry. l can go alone.

50:15.890 --> 50:18.820
- 你在做什么？  - 一个测试
-What do you got?  -lt's a test.

50:18.990 --> 50:21.220
监狱是在八十年代中期兴建
See, the prison was built  in the mid '80s.

50:21.390 --> 50:26.330
行政大楼的门是用电子密码锁
That exit in the administration building is  protected by an electronic coded lock...

50:26.500 --> 50:28.260
用安全卡改良而成
...modified by a security card.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.820
这些锁没有电力保护
Those locks  don't have power protection...

50:31.000 --> 50:32.900
也就是说你可以控制它
...which means  you can override them.

50:33.070 --> 50:35.630
你不能去炸掉大楼的发电机
You can't go to the building's generator,  blow it out.

50:35.810 --> 50:41.270
不行，一千二百伏特的  电流会触发警铃
No. Twelve-hundred-volt power surge  will just set off the other alarms.

50:41.450 --> 50:43.500
而且也会杀了你
Not to mention maybe kill you.

50:47.020 --> 50:49.080
所以我们要找其他方法
That's why we have  to find another way.

50:50.320 --> 50:51.810
没错
Yeah.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.030
没错
Yeah.

51:08.210 --> 51:10.700
- 曼宏，你查到什么？  - 目前没有
-Talk to me, Mahone. What do you got?  -Nothing yet.

51:10.910 --> 51:15.170
我不用你跟我报新状况  我要证据、动机，不是没用的东西
l don't need updates on the hour,  l need evidence, intent. lt's not crap.

51:15.350 --> 51:17.610
- 他犯罪时通知我  - 好
-Call me when he's committing a crime.  -Yeah.

51:17.780 --> 51:20.510
我不会让他跑掉，就像你一样
l'm not gonna let him walk away  from me like he did you.

51:20.680 --> 51:23.650
我要暗算他，他就完蛋了
He's going down  if I gotta shoot him in the back.

51:46.980 --> 51:48.540
抱歉
Sorry.

51:57.660 --> 51:58.710
我不知道
Well, l don't know.

52:05.830 --> 52:07.990
好了，女士们
All right, ladies.

52:21.250 --> 52:23.340
现在该我拿钱了，新来的
Time for me to get paid now, fish.

52:47.300 --> 52:48.570
我们是朋友吗？
Are we friends now?

52:48.740 --> 52:50.230
快离开
Get out of the way.

52:50.410 --> 52:52.880
- 发生什么事？  - 我什么都没看到
-What happened here?  -l didn't see anything, sir.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.030
- 走开  - 我也没看到
-Move.  -Me neither.

53:05.620 --> 53:07.220
坏消息
Bad news.

53:08.330 --> 53:10.950
爱格莎华伦死了
Agatha Warren is dead.

53:18.270 --> 53:21.140

他什么都没跟我说
He never said anything to me.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.150
他为什么不告诉我？
Why didn't he just tell me?

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.920
因为他知道你会阻止他

但可能你已经知道
But as you probably know now...

01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:34.060
反正，我剩下的日子也不多了
...I wouldn't have had much time  anyway...

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.590
所以我做出了选择
...so I made my choice...

01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:40.760
就绝不后悔

林克，我要你答应我  无论如何
And, Linc, I want you to promise me,  no matter what...

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:58.310
你都要陪在我孩子的身边

我要你答应我看着林克

你可能已经发现他老是有麻烦
As you may have noticed,  he has a tendency to get in trouble.

01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:20.430
却说不出我们最想说的话

01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:23.080
我们应该说的话

我们隐藏真意  我们借由纸鶴传递讯息
We speak in code  and we send little messages, origami.

你们会告诉我的孩子

你们会告诉我的孩子  每天都有人深爱着他们
