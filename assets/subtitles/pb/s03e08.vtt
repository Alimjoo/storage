你准备越狱 斯科菲尔德先生
You are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield.

00:21.780 --> 00:23.160
你得带上我
And you're taking me with you.

00:23.170 --> 00:24.440
那么
So with this deal

00:24.910 --> 00:27.900
他们到底想从我这得到些什么?
what specifically are they expecting from me?

00:27.910 --> 00:29.410
他们想知道所有的事
They need to know everything.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.470
他们要确认你的消息可靠
They want to confirm that you have viable,

00:31.480 --> 00:32.580

incriminating information

00:32.590 --> 00:34.890

给我看看照片
Show me the pictures.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.740
没照片看 兄弟

她死了 迈克

00:41.880 --> 00:44.240
不是说好了 你最好别来这吗
I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.190
我得知道这次耽搁会有多大影响
I need to know how this delay is going to affect things.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.740
再给我四天
four more days

00:47.890 --> 00:49.510
要是我能离开这的话
If I'm out of here by then

00:49.760 --> 00:51.340
我仍然能够做到
I can still do it.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.830
我会转告那两兄弟的

You like this?

You look sharp.

01:36.410 --> 01:36.580

01:36.590 --> 01:38.620
斯科菲尔德 有访客

又给了我们4天时间
Giving us four more days.

01:51.650 --> 01:53.050
好
Okay, good.

01:53.970 --> 01:55.310
听着 在交易地点
Listen, back at the exchange point,

01:55.320 --> 01:57.080
我看到了3个尸体袋
I saw three body bags.

01:57.330 --> 01:57.980
你 我 还有LJ的
You, me and LJ,

01:57.990 --> 01:59.890
他们没想放过我们
we weren't getting out of there alive.

02:02.780 --> 02:04.810
我不会再鲁莽行事了
That's the last time I get caught flatfooted.

02:06.410 --> 02:08.080
那就去做你该做的事 林肯
Then do what you got to do, Linc.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.680
我会管好我这里的事 行吗?
As long as I take care of my end, right?

02:12.060 --> 02:14.700
迈克我知道莎拉的事 你很生我的气 但
Michael, I know you're angry with me about Sara, but

02:14.710 --> 02:15.880
你说谎了
You lied.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.110
我不得不说谎
I had to lie.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.130
你儿子是我侄子
Your son is my nephew,

02:25.130 --> 02:27.250
我会为他做一切的
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

02:29.380 --> 02:30.650
但显然
But apparently

02:31.970 --> 02:34.240
你认为我只在意自己的事
apparently you only think I only care about myself.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.540
我知道你关心的不是自己
I know you don't care about yourself,

02:35.550 --> 02:37.800
你关心的是莎拉
but you cared about Sara.

02:37.910 --> 02:39.000
你爱她
You loved her.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.460
我很遗憾
And I'm sorry.

02:41.070 --> 02:42.040
但LJ是我儿子
But LJ's my son.

02:42.050 --> 02:43.960
我 我不能让他有事
I-I couldn't let anything happen to him.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.100
你知道的
You know that.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.270
你利用了我 林肯
You used me, Linc.

02:49.910 --> 02:52.570
你这点和组织倒是挺像的
So I guess you and the Company have something in common.

02:59.450 --> 03:00.450
我不知道他在哪
I don't know where he is.

03:00.460 --> 03:02.720
我所有号码都试了一遍
I have tried every number I have.

03:02.990 --> 03:06.560
听着 我会再去总部查查
Listen I will check back in headquarters

03:06.570 --> 03:07.930
看他们怎么说
and see what they say.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.040
别管了
Never mind.

03:11.570 --> 03:12.710
我找到他了
I found him.

03:20.540 --> 03:22.400
蓝色卡特
Carter Blue Label.

03:22.890 --> 03:23.550
你虽然出身平凡
You always had such

03:23.560 --> 03:26.850
却很有品味嘛
high-end taste for a girl from Wheeling.

03:28.220 --> 03:29.620
还不是用我的钱
Since I paid for it

03:31.080 --> 03:33.560
你知道我有多么痛恨四处奔波 格雷琴
You know how much I hate to travel, Gretchen

03:35.560 --> 03:39.440
但是考虑到这里的状况 我不得不破例来一趟
but considering the mess down here, I made an exception.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.500
在我来之前 这里就混乱不堪
It was a mess before I got here.

03:41.510 --> 03:43.220
那现在是时候清理下了
And it's time to clean it up.

03:43.430 --> 03:45.190
今天就做个了结吧
We're ending this today.

03:50.870 --> 03:52.320
来硬的
Bang and burn.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.200
将军 我已经分析过了
General, that was analyzed.

03:57.260 --> 03:58.010
如此做法
What you're asking for

03:58.020 --> 03:59.870
太危险了 更何况
is too dangerous, not to mention

03:59.880 --> 04:02.410
时间上根本来不及
next to impossible with the given time frame.

04:02.410 --> 04:02.960
我认为
I remember

04:02.970 --> 04:06.550
当一大笔钱汇到你海外帐户的时候
a substantial wire transfer to an offshore account

04:06.560 --> 04:08.770
那就意味着我们的字典里没有"不可能"
that took the word"impossible"

04:08.860 --> 04:11.700
难道说
out of the equation or tell me,

04:12.490 --> 04:14.340
是我选错了人?
did I hire the wrong person?

04:16.390 --> 04:19.900
提醒你做事要三思 也是我的工作
I am doing my job when I tell you to seriously reconsider.

04:20.580 --> 04:23.800
那现在 我要按我的意思办了
And now, I have to do my job.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.720
我不是花钱让你做我顾问的
I don't pay you to be my advisor.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.420
你只是执行任务的
You're my operator.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.210
你收到命令 就得完成任务
You have your instructions, now get it done.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.200
不然的话
Beuse if you don't,

04:35.870 --> 04:38.350
你上次在摩苏尔(伊拉克北部城市)
I'll make what happened to you in Mosul

04:38.420 --> 04:40.710
遭受的一切就只是个开头罢了
feel like a massage.

04:44.310 --> 04:46.110
这件事是个错误 格雷琴
This was a big mistake, Gretchen.

04:46.850 --> 04:48.840
你不能老来这里
You can't make a habit of coming to Sona.

04:49.270 --> 04:50.310
我不会了
I won't.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.860
因为我们要来硬的了
Because we're going with the bang and burn .

04:55.310 --> 04:56.690
那等于自寻死路
That's suicide.

04:57.810 --> 04:59.030
我们还有时间呢
We have more time.

04:59.730 --> 05:02.270
我老板想快点完事
My boss wants things to move a bit faster.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.130
那你告诉他这样行不通
Well, tell him you can't pull it off.

05:04.380 --> 05:05.710
这么干我可能会被杀了的
I might get killed if we do this.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.930
不这么干我就会被干掉了
And I might get killed if we don't.

05:08.440 --> 05:09.120
你和我之间
Between you and me,

05:09.130 --> 05:11.250
你认为我会更关心谁?
who do you think I care about more?

05:11.770 --> 05:13.260
看着我 詹姆斯
Look at me, James.

05:13.460 --> 05:15.850
看看我有多认真
See if you can tell how serious I am.

05:16.370 --> 05:17.780
如果你不配合
If you don't play ball,

05:17.790 --> 05:20.360
你就等着把牢坐穿吧
I will leave you in Sona to rot.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.190
我保证
I promise.

05:22.930 --> 05:24.550
5点钟 准备好
Be ready by 5:00.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.060
那时行动
That's when it happens.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.980
一起行动
Everybody goes.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.150
斯科菲尔德如何处置?
What about Scofield?

05:31.180 --> 05:32.400
杀了他
Kill him.

让他暂缓几天?

06:44.200 --> 06:45.260
经你昨天这么一闹
After your performance yesterday,

06:45.270 --> 06:47.250
我已经没有发言权了
I have no further sway with the colonel.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.560
那我恐怕你是选了条
Well, then I'm afraid you've brokered your way

06:48.570 --> 06:51.050
根本不可能成功的路来逃生
into an escape plan that no longer exists.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.540

现在 如果我们要控制索纳监狱 我们需要人手

07:17.450 --> 07:20.550
这里我现在谁都不信 尤其是现在

08:00.010 --> 08:01.440

除非我们的行动够快
when our guys are moving too fast

08:09.960 --> 08:11.070
眼睛够好使
for our night vision to work properly.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.940

08:53.060 --> 08:55.490
导致邻居家受到损害
some damage to the apartment next door.

08:57.290 --> 08:57.810
不好意思
I'm sorry.

08:57.820 --> 09:00.300
我想你把詹姆斯和其他人弄混了
I think you have confused James with someoneelse.

09:00.970 --> 09:02.870
他没租什么公寓
He's not renting another apartment.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.080
我确定是惠斯勒先生租了我的房子
Oh, I assure you Mr. Whistler is my tenant.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.940
自从他服刑后我就找不到人了
I couldn't find anyone to contact after his conviction,

09:08.010 --> 09:10.360
但是我看到了他的一封话费账单
but when the mail came, I checked his phone bill.

09:10.370 --> 09:12.270
他给这个号码打了很多电话
There were numerous calls to this number.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.870

我 不知道我们怎么出去
I, uh, I don't know how we're getting out of here.

10:01.130 --> 10:03.640
勒齐或许有办法 我还在等
Lechero might have some ideas, but I'm still waiting

10:03.650 --> 10:04.870
他的消息
to hear from him.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.630
对不起 你现在不方便吗
I'm sorry, is this a bad time for you?

10:09.020 --> 10:11.230
这一天很难熬
It's been an intense 24 hours.

10:11.610 --> 10:12.760
我脑子里很乱
I have things on my mind.

10:12.770 --> 10:16.460
也许和你上一次的探视有关
Yeah, like your last trip to visitation maybe.

10:17.610 --> 10:18.770
怎么 你监视我?
What, you're a spy now?

10:18.780 --> 10:20.650
如果说错了别怪我 不过她看起来
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but she didn't really strike me

10:20.660 --> 10:22.290
不像我喜欢的类型啊
as the girlfriend type.

10:22.620 --> 10:23.890
她是组织派来的
She was Company.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.680
你越狱失败后 她来提醒我
After your failed escape, she came to remind me

10:26.690 --> 10:28.180
我也是在冒险
that I have a stake in this, too,

10:28.570 --> 10:30.470
你似乎忘了这一点
which you seem to have forgotten.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.760
如果你说在筹备另一个越狱计划
So forgive me if I don't jump for joy

10:32.770 --> 10:34.560
别怪我没有兴高采烈
when you say you're working on a plan

10:34.570 --> 10:36.570
因为那个计划可能又会失败
that may very well fail again.

10:38.870 --> 10:39.560
我必须得出去
I've got to get out of here,

10:39.570 --> 10:41.970
无论用什么方法
and it's getting to the point where I don't care how.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.070
明白我的意思了吗
Got what we talked about?

10:51.770 --> 10:53.270
你从没见过我
You never met me.

11:14.970 --> 11:16.270
天哪
Oh, my God.

11:16.370 --> 11:17.970
发生什么事了?
What the hell is going on?

11:18.670 --> 11:19.960
谢尔斯
Shales

11:19.970 --> 11:21.660
奥斯卡·谢尔斯怎么了?
What about Oscar Shales?

11:21.670 --> 11:26.270
他 强奸 杀人 虐待
He raped, killed, tortured.

11:26.870 --> 11:28.160
但我没办法治他罪
I couldn't turn, turn him over

11:28.170 --> 11:31.260
那些混账律师要把他弄出去
to some scumbag lawyer who was just gonna get him off or

11:31.270 --> 11:34.970
不 我只是
or no, no, I just

11:36.570 --> 11:38.170
所以我杀了他
so I killed him.

11:42.170 --> 11:44.570
我感觉 很好
And I felt good.

11:48.970 --> 11:51.170
非常非常好
I felt, I felt really good.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.560
然后你知道吗 我脑海里就一直出现
But then, you know, came the visions

11:55.570 --> 11:57.560
谢尔斯求我放他生路的一幕
of Shales begging for his life,

11:57.570 --> 11:59.170
我摆脱不了
and I couldn't get rid of them,

11:59.270 --> 12:03.670
所以我得靠吃药来保持平静
so I, I got these drugs that kept me on an even keel.

12:05.070 --> 12:06.760
当我到了索纳监狱
And then when I got to Sona,

12:06.770 --> 12:10.670
我拿不到药 所以我不得不
I coul get my pills, so I had to

12:12.670 --> 12:14.470
临时救急
improvise.

12:18.770 --> 12:21.170
要我帮你弄点药吗
Did you want me to get drugs for you?

12:22.470 --> 12:24.960
我确信想让我作证的人
I assume that whoever set this up must think

12:24.970 --> 12:26.970
一定是觉得我还有价值
that I might have some value.

12:29.470 --> 12:32.270
这是你回来找我的原因吧
It's why you came back for me.

12:33.070 --> 12:39.570
我是来帮助一个我敬仰和关心的人
I came here to help a man that I respect and care about.

12:41.570 --> 12:43.570
荣幸之至
And I appreciate that.

12:46.370 --> 12:48.870
但是我现在这个样子没法作证
But I can't testify like this.

12:52.570 --> 12:53.870
求你了
Please

12:57.370 --> 12:58.770
求你了
Please

13:06.070 --> 13:09.170
窗户上都加了一英尺厚的强化钢
One inch of reinforced steel on every window.

13:09.170 --> 13:11.070
没人出的去
Nothing would get through those.

13:11.370 --> 13:12.970
我会找到办法的
I'll figure something out.

13:13.470 --> 13:14.870
我知道你会
I know you will.

13:16.270 --> 13:18.270
听着 刚才很抱歉
Listen, man, I'm sorry about before.

13:18.870 --> 13:20.760
就像我说的 事情变得很紧张了
Like I said, things have been intense.

13:20.770 --> 13:22.970
行动成功太重要了
So much depends on this working out.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.460
我侄子的命也取决于这次的行动
My nephew's life depends on this working.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.970
我知道
I know it does.

13:26.970 --> 13:28.670
我还没问过 他多大了?
I never asked how old is he?

13:29.070 --> 13:30.370
16岁
Sixteen.

13:30.570 --> 13:32.070
天哪
Oh, hell.

13:33.870 --> 13:35.370
叮咚 叮咚
Knock knocka.

13:36.570 --> 13:37.760
你来干嘛?
What do you want?

13:37.770 --> 13:40.360
我? 我只是来把一些东西
Me? I just came by to slip something

13:40.370 --> 13:41.460
扔进你的信箱里
into your mail slot.

13:41.470 --> 13:43.360
是老大给的
It's from El Patron himself,

13:43.370 --> 13:45.470
但是只给你们看
but it was made for your eyes only.

13:45.570 --> 13:46.670
收好了
Grabby.

13:47.470 --> 13:48.560
我看这可不像是一个舞会
That don't look like no invitation

13:48.570 --> 13:50.460
邀请函什么的
to the Sona-Hains Dance.

13:50.470 --> 13:51.860
你和勒齐在策划什么事?
What do you got cooking up with Lechero, huh?

13:51.870 --> 13:53.870
不关你的事 蒂博格
It's none of your business, Theodore.

13:54.970 --> 13:56.260
你想对我保密?
You want to keep secrets?

13:56.270 --> 13:58.560
你当我是一支讨厌虫? 随便你
You want to treat me like a pesky insect? Fine.

13:58.570 --> 14:00.360
给我记住 情报 就像面包屑
Just remember, information, like crumbs,

14:00.370 --> 14:02.870
总会撒落在地上让虫子吃掉的
always trickles down to the vermin on the floor.

14:12.170 --> 14:13.470
4点钟?
4:00?

14:14.570 --> 14:17.970
这是勒齐牢房的草图
It's a sketch of Lechero's quarters.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.360
老实说 如果有房客提前支付一年的房租
To be honest, when a tenant pays a year's rent in advance

14:33.370 --> 14:34.970
也不来住的话
and then gets locked up,

14:35.270 --> 14:36.360
我一般都会把这房子再租出去
I normally rent the place out

14:36.370 --> 14:38.960
赚双倍的钱 不过
and double my money, but, uh,

14:38.970 --> 14:40.570
詹姆斯人不错
James was a good man.

14:41.270 --> 14:43.270
我一直希望他的事情可以有转机
I was hoping things would turn out well for him.

14:47.370 --> 14:49.470
我说 夫人
Look, uh, miss

14:50.370 --> 14:53.360
很多人都会有一些自己的秘密
a lot of guys have a little something on the side.

14:53.370 --> 14:56.060
我是说 这个公寓 无论他带谁来过这里
This apartment, I mean, whoever he brought here,

14:56.070 --> 14:57.870
并不意味着他不爱你
doesn't mean he didn't love ya.

14:59.970 --> 15:03.770
你说你这有詹姆斯的保险单?
You said you have James' insurance paper?

15:04.870 --> 15:06.160
稍等 马上
Right on. Right on.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.070
我去给你拿来
I'll, uh, I'll go get them.

15:30.770 --> 15:32.470
哦 我的天
Oh, God.

15:45.370 --> 15:47.370
那儿还有一扇门
There's another door in here.

15:54.670 --> 15:56.770
"4413"
"4413."

16:17.470 --> 16:19.670
4413 对吧
4413, huh?

16:29.670 --> 16:31.260
那斯科菲尔德怎么办
What about Scofield?

16:31.270 --> 16:32.670
干掉他
Kill him.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.270
如果这个草图不是勒齐给我们的
You know, if Lechero didn't send this,

16:35.770 --> 16:37.970
那么这事就是有人派蒂博格算计我的
T-Bag might be setting me up for someone.

16:38.570 --> 16:40.060
我们从这里出去
I say we get out of here.

16:40.070 --> 16:43.170
迈克 你因为我惹上了这么多麻烦 很抱歉
I'm truly sorry you got caught up in my troubles, Michael.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.300
斯科菲尔德
Scofield.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.800
这儿还有一个密码锁
I take it there's another code.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.290
我是唯一知道的人
I'm the only one that knows it.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.890
对于一个喜欢保密的人
For a man who likes keeping a secret,

17:06.900 --> 17:08.290
选择蒂博格作为送信人
choosing T-Bag as a go-between

17:08.300 --> 17:09.490
可不是一个明智的选择
might not be the smartest move.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.290
是的 不过当他想明白的时候 我们早就跑远了
Yeah, by the time he figures it out, we'll be long gone.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.400
萨米正在回来的路上 走吧
Sammy's on his way back. Let's go.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.500
这是他妈什么?
What the hell's this?

17:37.700 --> 17:39.400
地下通道
Underground tunnel.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.890
原来看守用做
The old administration used it

17:41.900 --> 17:44.100
从A区到B区的通道
to travel between cellblocks A and B.

17:44.900 --> 17:49.000
自从暴动之后 他们把我们都转移到了B区
After the riots, they moved us all to B.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.200
然后当兵的就
And then the soldiers came in,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.500
把这个通道炸了
blew this tunnel up.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.000
看起来有人已经试图打通这些废墟了
Looks like someone already tried to get through the debris.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.200
我可没打算一辈子都待在这里
I never planned to spend my whole life in Sona.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.100
只是没想到这么快就得走了
Just didn't expect it to end so soon.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.400
你是工程师 对吧
You're the engineer, though, right?

18:14.900 --> 18:16.600
我想你能弄条路出去吧?
You can dig our way out of this?

18:16.600 --> 18:19.600
是的 但我需要几个装载机
Yeah, me and a couple of payloaders.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.790
给我听好了
Now, you listen.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.100
你必须得从这里挖出去
You're gonna dig out of this place.

18:23.400 --> 18:27.500
我们不能挖出去 不过我们可以试试向上挖
We're not digging out, but we might be diggin up.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.500
你好 索菲亚
Hello, Sofia.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.400
你好 你是谁
Hello. Who are you?

18:45.500 --> 18:46.900
詹姆斯的一个朋友
Friend of James.

18:47.600 --> 18:48.900
老朋友
Old friend.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.500
他现在不在
Well, he isn't here.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.800
我知道他在哪
I know where he is.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.000
我可知道詹姆斯为什么喜欢你了
I can see why James loves you.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.500
你真漂亮
You are beautiful.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.090
如果你继续到处瞎打探消息
If you keep sticking your nose where

19:05.100 --> 19:06.490
而不乖乖待着的话
it doesn't belong,

19:06.500 --> 19:09.490
我会让他再也见不到你的
I'm gonna make him miss you very, very much.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.600
你知道我的意思了吧
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

19:13.900 --> 19:15.100
很好
Good.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.300
这个不需要你来操心
You don't need to worry about this.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.700
听清楚了索菲亚 这样你才不会受到伤害
Now listen very carefully to me, Sofia, and you won't get hurt.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.090
我要你回家待着 做做头发
I want you to go home and do your hair

19:26.100 --> 19:27.790
涂好指甲 准备好
and paint your nails and get all ready

19:27.800 --> 19:29.400
等着詹姆斯回家
for when James comes home.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.190
然后你们就幸福地过一辈子
You two will live happily ever after.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.700
你想从他这儿得到什么
What do you want from him?

19:34.900 --> 19:37.100
瞧 你又不听话了
See? You're not listening already.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.690
别插手这事
Don't get in the way,

19:38.700 --> 19:42.100
不然你会很难堪的
or I promise you things will get very bad for you.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.200
你真的很漂亮
You are truly beautiful.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.900
我希望你可以始终这样
I hope you can stay that way.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.100
现在滚吧
Get the hell out of here

20:13.400 --> 20:15.490
好吧 如果我们可以穿过天花板
All right, if we can get through

20:15.500 --> 20:17.590
地基 还有上面的土层
the ceiling, the foundation and the earth on top othat,

20:17.600 --> 20:19.900
我们就可以上到禁入区了
we can make it out into the middle of no-man's-land

20:19.900 --> 20:22.100
然后我们可以在被击中之前到达围栏
and maybe hit the fence before we get shot.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.700
是啊 我们可不想被射死
Yeah. Well, we wouldn't want that.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.700
对的 不过你确实可以挖通 对吧
Yes, but you can dig out, though, right?

20:26.700 --> 20:29.390
根据重力学和索纳地下的沙质情况来看
Based on gravity and the kind of sand that Sona's built on,

20:29.400 --> 20:31.590
我们在挖掘时需要支柱来支撑这个通道
we're gonna need some kind of support brace for the tunnel.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.600
不然的话
Or

20:33.600 --> 20:34.500
不然怎样?
Or what?

20:35.100 --> 20:38.800
不然整个隧道会坍塌 我们就会被活埋
The whole thing collapses and we're buried alive.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.500
大家随便点
Go on and relax, huh?

20:45.700 --> 20:47.000
我去弄点朗姆酒来
I'll get some rum.

20:49.800 --> 20:50.490
这要花多久时间
How long will this take?

20:50.500 --> 20:51.900
大约两天
Maybe two days.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.190
我得上楼去看看 估算我们
I got to get upstairs, estimate exactly where

20:54.200 --> 20:56.600
从隧道出去后到底处于禁入区的什么方位
in no-man's land that tunnel's gonna let out.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.190
你去哪 我正考虑问题呢
Where you going? I'm meditating.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.390
来给克里斯托巴和他的人弄点朗姆酒
Just getng rum for Cristobal and his boys.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.600
朗姆酒? 给他的人
Rum? His boys?

21:10.700 --> 21:12.490
我确实说过愿意见见克里斯托巴
No, I said I'd meet with Cristobal,

21:12.500 --> 21:14.090
但不是一大堆人
not every half-breed in Sona.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.490
不过 他们现在正在上面呢
Well, they up there right now.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.890
那我们走
So, let's go.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.090
-让我给他们弄点朗姆酒吧 -没门
-Let me just get some rum, now. -No, man.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.390
让他们向其他人一样喝啤酒好了
Then drink beer like everyone else.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.190
我说 哥们 给他们点好东西
Look, man, offer them something good.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.000
不要让我难堪
Don't make me look fool.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.000
这酒是我的 萨米
The rum is for me, Sammy.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.000
我说不行
No?

21:30.300 --> 21:31.700
你有意见吗
You have a problem with that?

21:35.200 --> 21:36.300
没意见 先生
No, sir.

21:37.000 --> 21:37.890
很好
Good.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.000
那我们走吧
Let's go.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.200
我们继续干吧
Let's get back to work.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.400
只有勒齐才知道密码
Hey, only Lechero has the code.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.800
我们不需要密码
We don't need a code.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.490
进去
Now, get inside.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.300
在萨米回来之前
before Sammy comes back.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.200
阿历克斯
Alex?

22:16.600 --> 22:17.900
兰探员呢
Where's Agent Lang?

22:19.200 --> 22:20.500
她 不知道
Agent I don't know.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.300
你这是怎么了 发生什么了吗
But what the hell's wrong with you? What's going on?

22:25.400 --> 22:26.590
我有权紧张
I have a right to be nervous.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.290
我的处境很危险 不是吗
My life is on the line, you know?

22:28.300 --> 22:29.600
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

22:29.600 --> 22:32.390
你以前总是召开现场记者招待会
You have given live press conferences your entire life.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.090
我见过很多次了 你是老手了
I've seen you many times. You're an old pro.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.990
去洗个脸
Now, splash some water on your face.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.890
陪审团让我们现在就去 马上
The panel wants us there right now, immediately.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.000
-什么? -穿好衣服
-What? -Get dressed.

22:40.300 --> 22:40.890
还是你想让我
Or would you rather have me

22:40.900 --> 22:42.600
把你再送回索纳?
drag your ass back to Sona?

22:43.000 --> 22:46.500
洗洗脸 穿上西装 我们现在就走
Water on the face. Get your suit on. We're going.

22:50.900 --> 22:51.790
是 这是苏林斯
Yeah, it's Sullins.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.190
我们马上就出发了
Uh, we're almost ready to move here.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.600
兰到底去哪了
Where the hell is Lang?

22:56.300 --> 22:57.100
不
No.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.100
我们进展如何
Where are we at?

22:59.400 --> 23:00.490
一切就绪
Everything's in place.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.290
不错 我们准备好了
Good. We've done our part.

23:02.300 --> 23:04.700
现在就等惠斯勒了
Now it's time for Whistler to step up and do his.

23:05.300 --> 23:08.400
5点过来 他最好准备好了
Come 5:00, he better be ready.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.290
打通三尺厚的钢筋混凝土
Three feet of concrete and rebar,

23:11.300 --> 23:13.400
和10尺的泥沙
plus ten feet of dirt and sand,

23:13.400 --> 23:14.900
我们就能看见外面了
before we see sky.

So, Mr. Mahone,

33:10.600 --> 33:13.090
你第一次接触
when were you first contacted by anyone

33:13.100 --> 33:16.400
这个所谓的"组织"是什么时候
from the group referred to the Company?

33:16.900 --> 33:18.400
他们告诉我
They told me

33:19.500 --> 33:23.490
如果我不把福克斯河越狱的8个人都杀掉
that if I didn't kill every one of the Fox River Eight,

33:23.500 --> 33:25.100
他们就会来对付我
that they would come after me.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.190
那些人都跟斯科菲尔德一起
They had all worked with-with Scofield

33:27.200 --> 33:28.890
执行了越狱计划
on-on-on the escape,

33:28.900 --> 33:31.590
所以"组织"不确定他们到底知道了什么
so the Company wasn't sure what they knew.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.590
马宏先生 请你
Mr. Mahone, I'm going to ask you

33:33.600 --> 33:36.700
不要答非所问
to please keep your answer related to the question.

33:36.700 --> 33:37.890
这些其实都互有关联的
It's-it's all connected.

33:37.900 --> 33:40.000
它是个 是张复杂的大网
It's just it's-it's a web.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.600
我身陷在这个网里
And-and it's a web that I got caught in.

33:43.700 --> 33:45.890
林肯·布鲁斯被卷入其中
And-and Lincoln Burrows got caught in,

33:45.900 --> 33:47.090
迈克·斯科菲尔德也是
and Michael Scofield got caught in.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.890
我如果可以
I, if I may,

33:48.900 --> 33:50.490
我想马宏先生是想说
I think what Mr. Mahone

33:50.500 --> 33:51.590
-我们都像苍蝇一样 -我是说
-We're all just like flies -was trying to say

33:51.600 --> 33:52.790
谢谢你 苏林斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Sullins,

33:52.800 --> 33:54.700
但我们要听的是马宏先生的证词
but we're here to hear from Mr. Mahone.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.100
现在 我们再来一次
Now, we're going to try this again.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.790
你什么时候第一次接触到
When were you first contacted

33:58.800 --> 34:00.400
组织?
by the Company?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.400
我不能说
I cannot say.

34:05.800 --> 34:06.900
你知道
You know

34:07.200 --> 34:09.090
他们什么时候联络你 或者
they could be in contact with you or-or-or

34:09.100 --> 34:11.890
什么时候你被联络 都是未知的
you could be in contact with them, you'd never know.

34:11.900 --> 34:16.200
他们也许现在正在联络我们
It's-it's they could be in contact with us right now.

34:16.300 --> 34:17.100
我知道
I know

34:17.400 --> 34:18.190
这听起来太疯狂了 不是么?
it sounds crazy, right?

34:18.200 --> 34:19.590
简直疯了
It's crazy and

34:19.600 --> 34:23.300
但这很有可能 而事实上
and it would be, except for the simple fact that

34:23.400 --> 34:24.600
的确如此
It's true.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.590
我为之卖命的政府
The government that I had dedicated my life to

34:26.600 --> 34:30.000
操纵和威逼我
Manipulate and extorted me.

34:30.500 --> 34:31.700
并勒索我
Blackmailed me.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.700
所以我才为他们杀人
So that I would kill for them.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
我所做的一切都是他们逼的
And I did the things that they made me do

34:40.500 --> 34:42.100
因为我要保护我的家人
so I could protect my family.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.200
所以
And so

34:50.400 --> 34:52.000
我想回家
I would like to go home.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.000
我能回家么?
So can I do that, please?

35:06.600 --> 35:07.900
你去哪了?
Where have you been?

35:08.100 --> 35:08.690
我去找了
I came looking

35:08.700 --> 35:11.400
能支撑地道的废铁
for scrap metal for the support brace for the tunnel.

35:11.600 --> 35:12.500
当真?
Really?

35:14.700 --> 35:16.390
我看来上面挺挤的
Looks like a pretty tight squeeze up there.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.790
你肯定那里有充足的氧气
You sure there's enough fresh air,

35:17.800 --> 35:19.890
还是只有幽闭病人才会来这种地方?
or does the claustrophobia come and go?

35:19.900 --> 35:23.990
为什么总是如此不信任别人呢?
What's it like going through life always distrustful?

35:24.000 --> 35:25.190
你告诉我 詹姆斯
You tell me, James.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.790
不想打断你们的争吵 先生们
Hate to break up the brouhaha, gentlemen,

35:27.800 --> 35:29.800
但勒齐想见你
but Lechero would like to see you.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.700
想和你聊聊你大哥的事
Says it has something to do with your big brother.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.600
让我们单独待会好吗 蒂博格?
Give us a moment, will you, Teodoro?

35:58.900 --> 36:02.600
如果你哥再给我打电话
If your brother should ever call my cell phone again,

36:03.400 --> 36:05.400
告诉他你会因此付出代价的
you tell him you're the one that's gonna pay.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.590
喂
Yeah?

36:20.600 --> 36:22.190
-你收到消息了 -是的 你是对的
-You got the message. -Yeah, you were right.

36:22.200 --> 36:23.800
他们刚想把我们干掉呢
They just tried to take us out.

36:23.900 --> 36:24.700
我知道
I know.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.490
组织的人曾来探视过惠斯勒
Whistler got a visit from the Company.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.290
从那之后他行为就很反常
He's been acting strange ever since.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.590
林肯 我告诉你 肯定出事了
I'm telling you, Linc, something's up.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.990
兄弟 还有比行为反常更严重的
Doing more than acting strange, man.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.090
他告诉索菲亚别接近我
He just told Sofia not to be

36:32.100 --> 36:33.900
因为这很危险
near me 'cause it's dangerous.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.900
组织盯上我们了
The Company's coming after us.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.000
他们不再需要我们了
They don't need us anymore.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.900
准备行动
Here we go.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.600
他们要自己动手帮他越狱了
They're breaking him out on their own.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.290
我们距离目标100码
We're 100 yards from the target.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.600
保持警惕 行动要快
Keep your eyes open. Let's get in and out fast.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.200
来吧
Come on

37:11.700 --> 37:13.400
糟了
Damn

37:30.200 --> 37:31.100
快点
Come on

37:31.900 --> 37:33.400
快点 加把劲
Come on Keep it coming

37:35.300 --> 37:36.700
快啊
Come on Hey

37:42.400 --> 37:43.990
我看到了一架直升机和两名狱徒
I've got a helicopter and two inmates.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.500
我看不清他们的脸 但他们在屋顶
I can't make out their faces, but they're on the roof

37:59.500 --> 38:00.700
快啊
Come on

38:35.300 --> 38:36.600
看不清楚
Can't get a clean shot

38:37.500 --> 38:39.100
我降低高度 带他们走
I'll get lower, take 'em out

38:41.400 --> 38:43.600
是斯科菲尔德和惠斯勒在屋顶上吗
Is that Scofield on the roof with Whistler?

38:46.700 --> 38:49.100
毫无疑问
Is that really a question?

38:55.800 --> 38:57.390
他死定了
He's supposed to be dead.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.900
有人中枪 有人中枪
Man down. Man down.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.100
快走 我要掉下去了
Let go I'm slipping.

39:10.100 --> 39:13.000
惠斯勒掉下去了 行动中止 行动中止
We lost Whistler. Abort. Abort.

39:13.300 --> 39:14.190
任务失败
Mission failure.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.000
马上返回一号基地
Return to Base One immediately.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.500
阿历克斯
Alex

40:50.400 --> 40:51.700
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

40:52.900 --> 40:55.100
我不得不把你送回索纳监狱
I'm going to have to take you back to Sona.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.300
你 起来
You, get up.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.500
走
Vamos

41:44.200 --> 41:45.500
斯科菲尔德先生
Mr. Scofield,

41:47.100 --> 41:49.890
两天内发生了两起越狱未遂事件
there have been two escape attempts in the past two days.

41:49.900 --> 41:52.690
我相信这不是偶然
Somehow I don't think it's a coincidence

41:52.700 --> 41:55.700
都发生在你来后不久
that you arrived shortly before they happened.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.400
我与此事无关
I had nothing to do with that.

42:03.200 --> 42:06.100
你在索纳惹事太多
You've caused too many problems here in Sona,

42:06.900 --> 42:09.400
或许你不该留在索纳
so maybe you shouldn't be here in Sona.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.100
把他带走
Get him out.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.600
和索纳说再见吧 斯科菲尔德先生
Say good-bye to Sona, Mr. Scofield.
