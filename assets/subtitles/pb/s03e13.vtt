00:03.850 --> 00:05.400
该死的 你搞什么鬼?

00:05.410 --> 00:06.670
看好了 我手上有你需要的东西
You know I havewhat you need

00:06.680 --> 00:07.960
到时候我会给你另一半的
And I'll give you the rest

00:07.970 --> 00:10.310
前提是我确认索菲亚 lj
After I know that Sofia, lj

00:10.320 --> 00:11.730

00:24.090 --> 00:26.590
是我们交易的地方 按我们的约定
Where we're gonna make the exchange on our terms.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.010
沿路下去5英里的一个废弃仓库
An abandoned warehouse five miles down the road.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.310

00:32.840 --> 00:34.730

Papa, what do we do?

惠斯勒还在假装他的那套渔夫言论?
Whistler still pretending he's a fisherman and all this?

00:36.930 --> 00:39.050
如果他不是渔夫 他又是干什么的呢?
Well, if he's not a fisherman, what is he?

00:39.060 --> 00:40.350
我才不管他说什么
I don't care what he says

00:40.360 --> 00:42.660
我根本不认识什么叫迈克·斯科菲尔德的家伙
I don't know anything about this Michael Scofield guy

00:42.670 --> 00:46.590
你确认还要继续撒谎下去吗 费尔南多?
You sure you don't want to change your story Fernando?

00:46.990 --> 00:49.430
我想这是我们分道扬镳的地方
I guess this is where I say good-bye.

No

00:59.960 --> 01:01.410

What are we gonna do now?

02:48.360 --> 02:49.720
能借用下手机吗?
Do you have a cell phone?

02:51.310 --> 02:52.470

03:11.600 --> 03:12.880
让我猜猜电话那头是谁
Let me guess.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.220
如果他有什么意外
If anything happens to him

03:16.230 --> 03:17.790
那要看情况了 不是吗?
That depends, doesn't it?

03:19.850 --> 03:21.770
我已经到了你说好的仓库了
I'm at the warehouse, like you said.

03:21.780 --> 03:22.710

03:34.000 --> 03:36.260
我花了2周时间布置那仓库
It took me two weeks to hook up that warehouse.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.690
我们总能想出对策的
We'll figure something out.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.470
我能修复这一切 也是我正试图做的
I can fix this. that's what I was trying to do.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.100
你打电话让他们来接你
You were calling them to pick you up.

03:41.110 --> 03:43.060
这样就不会再有人受到伤害了
So no one else would get hurt

03:44.830 --> 03:47.090
你真以为我会让别人去冒险吗?
You really think I would put anyone's life at risk?

03:47.100 --> 03:48.630
你早就这么做了
You already ve.

04:04.980 --> 04:06.620
爸爸 我可不想回索纳监狱去

你不会回索纳监狱的
You're not going back to Sona.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.210
问几个问题
A couple of questions

04:28.220 --> 04:29.920
然后就可以走了
and you'll be on your way

04:30.480 --> 04:32.450
我们正在寻找
We're looking for

04:32.460 --> 04:36.610
四个从索纳监狱逃出来的逃犯

04:36.810 --> 04:38.930

还是打算告诉我迈克·斯科菲尔德哪去了?
Or do you want to tell me where Michael Scofield is?

我不知道他在哪里
I don't know where he is.

You know, from the first day you started here,

05:48.490 --> 05:50.360
我就知道这里面有什么猫腻
I knew there was something off about you.

05:53.430 --> 05:55.670
或与我能第一眼就分辨出是否是囚犯
I guess I just know a con when I see one, huh?

05:55.680 --> 05:58.460
或许你能成为当月之星优秀员工
Maybe you'll get to be employee of the month.

有很多目击者来保护你们

就不必担心有人要杀你了
To kill you if you were on their side.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.120
而且他们报酬丰厚
They certainly pay well.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.560

13:10.600 --> 13:11.520
失去目标
I've lost him.

13:11.530 --> 13:12.710

13:29.030 --> 13:30.720

13:51.750 --> 13:53.410
把油布拿下来
Remove the tarp

13:55.110 --> 13:56.190
我想如果有人爬上我的卡车的话
I think I would have noticed if

13:56.200 --> 13:57.640
我肯定会发现的
someone had climbed on my track

13:57.650 --> 13:58.560
还要我重复
Do I have to repeat

13:58.570 --> 13:59.960

14:00.150 --> 14:01.510
把那该死的油布揭开
Remove the damn tarp

14:01.520 --> 14:03.340
不然我们就扣留你的车
or we'll impound your track

14:13.160 --> 14:14.680
是肥料
It's fertilizer.

14:21.670 --> 14:23.290

Gracias, papa.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.120
还有一站
One more stop.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.680
下面开始暴动了
There's a storm brewing out there in the yard.

15:26.570 --> 15:27.950
去告诉他们
You tell them

15:27.960 --> 15:29.490
尽管来 我不怕他们
Come in. I'm not scared.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.800
我怕
Well, I am.

15:31.990 --> 15:34.210
那东西 还是放下吧
You might want to put that down.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.280
蒂博格
Oh, Teodoro.

15:54.610 --> 15:57.220
真没想到帮我的人会是你
You're the last one I'd expect to see at my side.

15:57.310 --> 15:59.370
我始终站强大这方 老大
I take offense, patron.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.380
我有过很多提鞋的人
I've had many foot-washers.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.080
很多都披着伪善的外衣
Many men have come in with sheep's clothing,

16:04.700 --> 16:06.040
到后来就全部暴露本性了
Only to let the wolf come out.

16:09.870 --> 16:13.050
我不想害你 只是想要帮你
I am not trying to hurt you. I am trying to save you.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.360
帮我?
Save me?

16:14.370 --> 16:16.170
我会死在这
I'm gonna die here.

16:16.220 --> 16:18.650
和我待这儿 就是死路一条
Your life is in jeopardy just being with me.

16:18.940 --> 16:21.100
未必
Not necessarily.

16:22.590 --> 16:26.060
当我刚才被押回来的时候
As I was being escorted back inside today, one of the guards

16:26.070 --> 16:29.400
有一个警卫说 我们有机会买回自由
Offered us a chance to buy our freedom.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.980
如果警卫跟你说 那他就是在骗你
If a guard spoke to you, he was lying.

16:32.990 --> 16:34.760
出去根本不可能
It's impossible to get out.

16:35.430 --> 16:37.640
也许你还没注意到就被警卫毙了
Maybe you've been too busy dying to notice,

16:37.650 --> 16:39.540
但是外面来了个新军官
But there's a new colonel outside those gates.

16:39.550 --> 16:42.730
小小的索纳监狱现在看管
Little suzy Sona ain't playing so hard

16:42.740 --> 16:44.690
没那么严了 有钱就行
To get no more. she has her price.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.710
我们需要一笔钱

No.

16:48.670 --> 16:50.050

Then you will die in here.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.050
迈克
Michael.

17:02.060 --> 17:04.490
古代博物馆的大厅
The lobby of the museum of antiquities.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.340
为什么
Why?

17:05.350 --> 17:07.780
因为惠斯勒在那
Because that's where Whistler is.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.280
你太精明了
You're overthinking things.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.070
我以前见识过太多了
I've seen it too many times before.

17:11.080 --> 17:13.910
第一个计划失败 你就开始虚张声势了
The first plan goes to hell and then you start tap-dancing,

17:13.920 --> 17:16.470
相信我 计划终归会流产
And, trust me, it always ends badly.

17:16.510 --> 17:18.280

21:03.290 --> 21:04.730
我早厌烦了
I'm sick of jumping through hoops

21:04.740 --> 21:05.850
整天把你的公主当宝贝似的照顾
To keep your princess in a bubble.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.590
-是时候该走了 -这是我俩之间的事
It is time to go. this is between us.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.140

等我们一出去就开枪
Ready to shoot as soon as we stepped outside.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.590

33:59.870 --> 34:03.970
我在此将他埋葬
I come before you now to bury the man

34:05.980 --> 34:07.860
并不是要赞扬他什么
not to praise him,

34:08.730 --> 34:10.330
因为他在这里残酷的统治
For there is nothing praiseworthy

34:10.340 --> 34:12.000
根本就没有值得赞扬之处
About his rule here.

34:13.290 --> 34:17.040
让我们其中的一员发号施令?
Having one of our own dictate to us?

34:17.260 --> 34:19.520
那可不符合自然规律
Well, that's just not the natural order.

34:20.630 --> 34:24.330
在这里都是平等的
All cons are equal

34:30.640 --> 34:32.570
我这里还剩余一些
I have the last remnants

34:34.010 --> 34:38.160
勒齐剥削来的财富
Of Lechero's cruel empire in my hand.

34:39.880 --> 34:44.040
我曾渴望加入他们之中
An empire which I willingly participated in

34:44.440 --> 34:46.570
也曾目睹他们的恶行
And witnessed first-hand.

34:50.080 --> 34:54.850
这些钱 都是压榨你们而来
Money made off of your backs

34:55.120 --> 34:56.790
全是出自你们的辛劳
And off the backs of your family

34:59.620 --> 35:01.240
现在这些是你们的了
It's yours.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.890

35:03.810 --> 35:05.440
我要将它们物归原主

35:12.360 --> 35:15.060
物归原主 弟兄们
Giving it back, brothers.

35:19.180 --> 35:20.910

36:35.510 --> 36:36.970

在莎拉和我被囚禁的屋子里我找到了这个
I found this in the room where Sara and I were he

36:42.650 --> 36:44.720
我想也许你需要它

很抱歉
I'm sorry.

37:19.350 --> 37:20.680

How's Sofia doing?

37:25.650 --> 37:27.130
-她很好 -好的
She's good. good.

37:27.140 --> 37:28.730
警察很快会离开
The cops will be leaving soon.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.040
然后你就能上去看看她了
You can go up and see her, then.

37:30.050 --> 37:31.330
太好了

37:31.610 --> 37:33.930
她想让我告诉你
She wanted me to tell you something.

37:34.530 --> 37:35.440
在她公寓的
She said there's something

37:35.450 --> 37:37.430
床底
In her apartment underneath her bed.

37:37.610 --> 37:40.010
-有一些关于惠斯勒的情报 -我不感兴趣
Something about Whistler. I'm not interested.

37:42.890 --> 37:44.280
是什么?
What is it?

37:45.430 --> 37:46.560
迈克 已经结束了
Michael, this is over.

37:46.570 --> 37:47.890
到此为止了
It's done.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.550
我问 那是什么?
I said,"what is it?"

38:09.760 --> 38:11.020
你迟到了
You're late.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.430
我的饮料你付钱
And you owe him for my drinks.

38:17.900 --> 38:19.440
能让我们单独呆会儿吗
Give us a minute?

38:29.900 --> 38:31.620
出手挺大方
It's a nice tip.

38:32.220 --> 38:34.070
她付了我钱
She handles the money.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.520
加入吗
You in?

38:43.400 --> 38:46.080
若她能付比那更多的钱
She'd better be able to handle a lot more than that.

38:46.870 --> 38:48.150
因为如果她真如你所想
Because if she has done

38:48.160 --> 38:51.900
