00:03.100 --> 00:05.420
你到底在医务室里干什么?
What you're doing in the infirmary,

00:05.430 --> 00:06.790
那跟咱们做的有什么联系?
what's it gotta do with here?

00:06.800 --> 00:08.790
四天后的晚上  咱们就能离开这里了
Four days from now,on the night of the escape,

00:08.800 --> 00:11.720
我们有18分钟的 时间从医务室逃走
we'll have 18 minutes to get the bars off the window

00:11.730 --> 00:14.320
一共7个人将爬过电线
and for all seven of us to get across the wire

00:14.330 --> 00:15.120
越过高墙
and over the wall.

00:15.130 --> 00:17.720
-可能么?  -当然
-Is that doable?  -Of course.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.830
玛丽克鲁兹  是我 亲爱的  到底出了什么事?
Maricruz, what the hell is going on?

00:19.840 --> 00:23.290
赫克托说你可以慢慢享受牢狱生活
Yeah, well, Hector says you can serve your full sentence.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.680
你来这儿干嘛? 玛丽克鲁兹呢?
What are you doing here?where is Maricruz

00:24.690 --> 00:26.460
她再也不会来了
She's not gonna be coming around here any more.

00:26.470 --> 00:28.310
你在和我开玩笑?
It's ajoke, right?

00:28.320 --> 00:29.790
她现在跟我了
She's with me now.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.330
我只是想知道
I just need to know

00:31.340 --> 00:35.780
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德 为什么要为你换取绿卡?
what Michael Scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.560
在监狱里你要绿卡有什么用?
Why would you need a credit card in prison?

00:39.200 --> 00:42.720
如果我知道事情会 发展到现在这个地步的话
If I'd known how this was gonna turn out,

00:42.730 --> 00:44.300
我宁愿去捡联邦人员的烂摊子
I'd have gotten some crap job with the Feds.

00:44.310 --> 00:47.080
你再说下去我就把子弹放到你脑袋里
Keep talking like that,I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.690
我必须出去
I need to get out

00:48.700 --> 00:50.590
我还有我的生活
while I still got my life.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.550
爸爸! 爸爸!
Daddy! Daddy!

00:51.560 --> 00:52.780
事情变了
Things have changed.

00:52.790 --> 00:53.920
我想加入
I want in.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.020
怎么了?
So?

00:56.030 --> 00:57.820
咱们人太多了
We've got too many people.

00:57.830 --> 01:01.400
我算了一下  他们中必须有一个人放弃
I've done the math. One of 'em has to go.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.620
抱歉让您久等
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:04.630 --> 01:06.690
没有关系
Oh, it's not a problem.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.590
很不错的简历
Impressive resume.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.970
多谢
Thank you.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.850
告诉我你为什么选择 继续在工程领域发展
Tell me why you chose to pursue a career in engineering.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.620
是这样的
Well, um...

01:16.630 --> 01:22.350
我一直对结构和几何学比较感兴趣
I've always been interested in structure.Geometry.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.750
(还有)物体是怎样结合在一起的
How things fit together.

01:25.760 --> 01:30.990
建筑物功能的展现...
How an object that performs a function

01:31.000 --> 01:32.390
同样也应该算作艺术
can also be a work of art.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.450
你的未来是怎么打算的?
What about the future?

01:34.460 --> 01:38.160
你认为5年后你会变成什么样?
Where do you see yourself in five years?

01:50.300 --> 01:53.830
一套制服  黑色
One suit, black.

03:36.130 --> 03:41.930
那个小男孩长大了么?
That baby boy all growed up yet?

03:42.560 --> 03:46.120
再过几年他就会闹的天翻地覆了
Oh, he's gonna raise hell the next few years.

03:46.130 --> 03:49.630
就像他妈妈那样
Take after his momma.

03:50.660 --> 03:55.600
是的  和过去差不多
Yeah, you know. Same old same up here.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.900
但是  嗯...
But, uh...

04:00.230 --> 04:02.950
情况有些不妙
things are getting pretty tense.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.620
比如冲突啊什么的
Like they're fixing to, uh... collide.

04:05.630 --> 04:08.250
了解我的意思么  吉米?
You know what I mean, Jimmy?

04:08.260 --> 04:13.190
可能会...
There's a potential situation.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.320
我找到进入医务室的办法了
I found our access to the infirmary.

04:15.330 --> 04:17.490
但我需要些时间来运作
I'm gonna need time to make it work.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.460
需要多久?
How much time?

04:18.470 --> 04:23.720
足够找出不用梯子就能从 20英尺深的排水管道里上去的方法
Enough for me to find my way up a 20 ft vertical drainpipe without using a ladder.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.720
明天的狱工我去不了了
I'll probably need to skip PI tomorrow

04:25.730 --> 04:27.520
如果我想把事情完成的话
if I wanna get this thing done.

04:27.530 --> 04:29.550
不能不去
You can't just skip it.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.890
这不像是上学
It ain't class.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.950
如果狱警突然来了怎么办?
What if one of the bulls decides to drop in?

04:32.960 --> 04:34.790
我已别无选择了  不是么?
I don't have a choice, do I?

04:34.800 --> 04:37.550
只要我们能打通警卫室的管道
Once we get through the pipe below the guards' room

04:37.560 --> 04:39.290
剩下的事就容易多了
it'll be easier.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.660
我不通过门就能到达各处
I can come and go without using the door,

04:41.670 --> 04:43.460
韦斯特莫兰德为咱们放哨
and with Westmoreland as lookout,

04:43.470 --> 04:45.690
还要再加个人来帮忙挖掘
we'll have one more man for digging.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.300
韦斯特莫兰德可不是省油的灯
He's a problem.

04:47.310 --> 04:49.840
咱们7个人要想爬过那墙根本不可能
All seven of us can't break over that wall in 18 minutes.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.930
你自己也说了  根本不可能
You said it yourself. It's impossible.

04:51.940 --> 04:55.450
兄弟我告诉你 咱们必须要甩掉一个人
Listen, man, one of us has gotta take a hike.

04:55.460 --> 04:56.940
我知道
I know.

04:56.950 --> 05:01.260
介意告诉我你们在谈什么么?
Mind if I share that with the rest of the class?

05:01.730 --> 05:05.810
很显然  大学生已经计算过
Apparently, college boy here did the math.

05:05.820 --> 05:09.180
我们的"车"已经超载了
Figured out that we got too many clowns in the car.

05:09.190 --> 05:10.330
也就是说虽然咱们都在这里挖洞
So one of us is in here digging,

05:10.330 --> 05:13.330
但最后却有个人连座位都落不着
but his seat ain't guaranteed.

05:13.340 --> 05:14.980
你有什么意见么  伙计?
How's this your problem?

05:14.990 --> 05:16.740
他根本就不知道自己在说什么
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.870
要是不带我出去  我就不挖了
I won't dig if I'm not gonna go.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.870
我们必须决定不带谁
We need to decide who gets cut.

05:20.880 --> 05:25.850
这个大家心里早就有数了  对么?
I think we all can agree who that should be,right?

05:27.570 --> 05:31.260
噢  不好意思打扰你们了
Pardon me for interrupting,

05:31.270 --> 05:34.290
但是  呃...
but, uh...

05:34.780 --> 05:37.650
这像是什么?
what's that smell?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.560
我闻到了阴谋的气味
It smells a little like conspiracy.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.980
我们必须抓紧干活了
We need to get back to work.

05:44.990 --> 05:47.260
在此之前  我有话要说
I have an announcement to make.

05:47.270 --> 05:50.680
我发觉我越来越被你们忽视了
I've been growing leery of the way you all talk like I'm a lesser man,

05:50.690 --> 05:53.820
于是我就买了一份保单
so I bought an insurance policy.

05:53.830 --> 05:57.800
我和外面的兄弟通了电话 并把咱们的计划告诉了他
I called up my guy on the outside and I told him about our plan,

05:57.810 --> 06:01.180
我告诉他  如果可能 下周就能见到他了
and I told him in all likelihood I'll be seeing him next week.

06:01.190 --> 06:03.250
但是...
But...

06:03.530 --> 06:07.710
如果在逃走前5分钟或是成功后 20分钟还收不到我的消息的话
if he don't hear from me five minutes before the escape and 20 minutes after,

06:07.720 --> 06:12.620
他就会给监狱打电话 告诉他们全部的事情
I told him to call up the warden, blow the whistle on the whole thing.

06:12.630 --> 06:17.460
所以如果你们已经想好了如何对付我的话
So if y'all got ideas about getting rid of me,

06:17.690 --> 06:22.050
我建议你们还是想想其他办法吧
I suggest you make other plans.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.990
那狗日的到处和我们作对
Son of a bitch has got a countermove for everything.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.810
这次不会了
Not for this.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.780
谁会被踢出  我还是你
Odd men out. Me and you.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.620
什么意思?
What do you mean?

07:12.630 --> 07:15.070
看你现在和谁在一起
Look who you're walking with right now.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.730
你本应该和他们步调一致的
You should be up there,

07:16.740 --> 07:19.100
一起安排怎么逃出去
calling the shots with the rest of the suits.

07:19.110 --> 07:22.560
-没错  那又怎么样?   -怎么样...
-Yeah? So?  -So.

07:22.570 --> 07:25.410
斯科菲尔德来这儿只有一个目的
Scofield is only here for one reason.

07:25.420 --> 07:27.060
就是他哥哥
His brother.

07:27.070 --> 07:29.150
他只需要两样东西
And he only needs two things.

07:29.160 --> 07:33.040
老头的钱  还有土匪头子的飞机
The old man's money, and the mob boss's plane.

07:33.050 --> 07:35.250
他根本用不着你
He don't need you.

07:35.260 --> 07:38.740
你只不过是碰巧和他一个牢房而已
You just happened to be in the same cell when he got here.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.920
你和厕所
You and the toilet.

07:39.930 --> 07:41.970
我为此做了很多
I've done a lot of work on this thing.

07:41.980 --> 07:44.380
我又何尝不是呢
Exactly. Me too.

07:44.390 --> 07:47.040
咱们都是给人家当苦力的
We're just the labourers on this thing, man.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.080
真到该逃出去的时候
The night that fish goes into that hole,

07:49.090 --> 07:51.740
你真的认为他会带上这么多累赘么?
you think he wants all that extra baggage?

07:51.750 --> 07:53.760
这就是咱们
Cos that's all we are.

07:53.770 --> 07:57.270
我不管你要怎样  我要走了
I don't know about you, but I'm going.

07:58.900 --> 08:03.120
他到底告诉了你多少呢?
How much does he tell you, anyways?

08:03.130 --> 08:06.400
还是只有他一个人知道?
Or does he keep it all to himself?

08:06.410 --> 08:10.340
他肯定会说  你知道的越少越少  对么?
Yeah, he probably tells you the less you know the better, right?

08:10.350 --> 08:12.190
你根本什么都不知道
You don't know what you're talking about.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.820
他什么都告诉我了
He tells me everything.

08:13.830 --> 08:19.140
他要真都告诉你了  那你就不需要他了
If he tells you everything, then you don't need him.

08:19.150 --> 08:24.220
咱们可以自己逃出去  我和你
Now, we can go by ourselves. Me and you.

08:24.780 --> 08:27.570
或者你可以等
Or, you know, you can wait, and see

08:27.580 --> 08:31.400
然后看看斯科菲尔德到底 愿不愿意带上闲杂人等
if Scofield really wants to carry a heavy weight.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.520
你决定吧  伙计
It's up to you, papi.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.700
嘿  我还等着呢
Yo. I'm still waiting.

08:44.710 --> 08:46.050
在等什么?
What for?

08:46.060 --> 08:48.660
我帮你搞定了那块手表 我的工作呢?
I swiped you that watch, man. Where's my PI?

08:48.670 --> 08:50.090
根本不可能
That's not gonna happen.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.070
你答应过我
You promised.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.290
我说我会考虑  或许在不远的将来
I said I'd think about it. Maybe somewhere down the road.

08:55.300 --> 08:59.180
我才不信你的鬼话呢
Yeah, I ain't gonna hold my breath.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.240
那我该怎么做?
What do you want me to do?

09:09.250 --> 09:10.460
快去找人! 快去!
Get somebody.

09:10.470 --> 09:13.510
不  不  不! 不要  他们看到子弹肯定会报警的
No, no, they see a bullet, they're gonna call the cops.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.450
这不是没办法了么? 我是不会让你死的
We don't have a choice! I'm not gonna let you die.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.920
找到它!
Find it.

09:16.930 --> 09:17.480
什么?
What?

09:17.490 --> 09:19.530
子弹  找到它然后挖出来
The bullet. Just find it and dig it out.

09:19.540 --> 09:22.600
我办不到  -照我说的做!
I can't.  -Do it!

09:49.090 --> 09:51.820
斯科菲尔德呢?
Where's Scofield?

09:55.410 --> 09:57.480
原来在这儿
There you are.

09:57.490 --> 10:01.320
刚去牢房找过你  哪儿都找不到你
Just looked for you in your cell. Couldn't find you anyplace.

10:01.330 --> 10:03.790
当然  也没发现你的信用卡
Couldn't find your credit card either.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.880
你明白我的意思
You know the one I'm talking about.

10:05.890 --> 10:08.730
就是你那个当鸡的老婆 前几天偷着带进来的那张
The one your whore wife trunked in the other day.

10:08.740 --> 10:12.470
她都告诉我了
She told me all about it.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.440
或许妓女很厉害吧
Maybe "whore" is too strong.

10:14.450 --> 10:19.920
你是怎么把一个嫁给 重罪犯的女孩弄到美国来的呢?
What do you call a girl who married a felon to get into the United States?

10:19.930 --> 10:21.850
她来这里的目的又是什么呢?
Why'd she have to come here, anyway?

10:21.860 --> 10:23.800
Whazistan没有脱衣俱乐部?
No strip clubs in Whazitstan?

10:23.810 --> 10:25.790
-贝利克警官  -是警长
-Officer Bellick...  -Captain.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.600
好  能否在别的时间进行您的审问呢?
Fine. Do you mind conducting your inquisitions on your own time?

10:29.610 --> 10:31.780
我可没那么多的时间
I've a schedule to maintain.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.240
不好意思  医生
Excuse me, Doctor.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.840
我只是想问问斯科菲尔德 先生关于违禁品的事情
I was just asking Mr Scofield about the contraband

10:35.850 --> 10:39.680
他的脱衣舞老婆那天带进来的
he had his stripper wife trunk in the other day.

10:39.690 --> 10:43.790
你先忙你的  你的工作更重要
But you go ahead. Your job's more important.

10:55.940 --> 10:58.820
自从我进来那天他就和我过不去
He's had it out for me since the day I got here.

10:58.830 --> 11:02.940
-不要动  -不好意思
-Hold still, please.  -Sorry.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.680
我和她结婚...
I only married her

11:14.690 --> 11:16.810
这样她才能拿到绿卡
so she could get her green card.

11:16.820 --> 11:20.700
我看到你们从夫妻间里出来了
I saw you coming out of the conjugal room.

11:21.490 --> 11:24.210
不过是场交易罢了
That's just business.

11:24.220 --> 11:26.770
迈克尔  你没必要跟我解释这些
You don't have to explain it to me, Michael.

11:26.780 --> 11:29.350
我知道
I know.

11:30.830 --> 11:33.790
我觉得有必要说
But I want to.

11:40.050 --> 11:41.650
大盗?
DB. Oh,

11:41.660 --> 11:46.020
你还真成大盗了? 我一直以为你只是个牛仔呢
is that who you is now? I thought you was just a cowboy.

11:46.030 --> 11:47.960
离我远点  臭小子
Take a couple of steps back, boy.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.660
有件事我一直想不明白
What I can't understand

11:49.670 --> 11:52.220
你都这把年纪了竟然还想出去
is why somebody like you wants to get out anyway.

11:52.230 --> 11:53.830
出去后怎么生存呢?
How you gonna survive, huh?

11:53.840 --> 11:56.380
世界变了  变得很恐怖...
The world's all different now. It's scary.

11:56.390 --> 11:59.620
人家都用电脑打电话  用硅胶隆胸
They got computer phones, boobies made of silicone.

11:59.630 --> 12:00.990
你什么都不会做
You wouldn't know what to do.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.270
我没必要向你证明什么
I don't have to justify myself to you.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.880
不  你必须要证明一下
Oh, you're gonna have to.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.500
否则这把老骨头会拖我们后腿的
Them old bones is gonna be dragging us down.

12:07.510 --> 12:10.630
或许我现在就折断几根试试
Maybe I'll just snap a few right now...

12:10.640 --> 12:12.100
你尽管来
Take your best shot.

12:12.110 --> 12:15.410
嘿  你们是怎么回事!
Hey, break it up down there!

12:16.160 --> 12:22.230
退出吧  牛仔 我不会再警告你的
Bow out, cowboy. I'm not gonna warn you no more.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.360
什么事?
What's up?

12:51.180 --> 12:57.300
院子里电话的记录 詹姆斯·博格威尔  住在加里市区
Records from the phone in the yard. James Bagwell lives down in Gary.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.010

T-Bag's insurance policy?

12:59.020 --> 12:59.660
没错

12:59.670 --> 13:04.660
我的人会暂时把他们关在货车里 直到咱们安全以后
My guy's gonna lock him up in a moving van for a couple of days until we're in the clear.

13:04.670 --> 13:07.560

13:07.570 --> 13:13.250
放心  不会有事的 我们经常这样做的
Don't worry. He can breathe, and all. We do it all the time.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.570
那帝博格呢?
What about T-Bag?

13:15.580 --> 13:20.150
他不再是威胁了  相信我
He's no longer a threat. Trust me.

13:36.890 --> 13:40.570
您是詹姆斯·博格威尔么? 有您的邮包
You James Bagwell? Got a delivery for you.

13:40.580 --> 13:43.710

14:02.270 --> 14:04.310
他还好吧?
Is he gonna be OK?

14:04.320 --> 14:06.720
我们现在还不知道  他失血过多
We don't know yet.

14:06.730 --> 14:09.850
我本打算给警察打电话的 但我还是想先和你谈谈
I was gonna call the police,I wanted to speak with you first.

14:09.860 --> 14:12.450
他的伤很显然是枪伤
His wound is obviously the product of a gunshot.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.630
你最好对我说实话
You need to be honest with me.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.400
枪伤到底是怎么来的?
What was he doing when he got shot?

14:17.410 --> 14:20.160
他当时在车库里  在车子的下面
He was in the garage, underneath his car.

14:20.170 --> 14:21.340
他现在还在急诊室
He's in surgery right now.

14:21.350 --> 14:25.050
失血已经导致他的肌肉组织缺氧
The blood loss has caused his muscle tissue to suffer from a lack of oxygen.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.950
他的肩膀也受到相同程度的损伤
He's sustained damage to his shoulder.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.180
而且体内的子弹还未取出 感染的几率也会随之升高
With a bullet there's an increased risk of infection.

14:31.190 --> 14:32.790
所以还得早点确定下来的好
So he has to be admitted.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.670
需要给什么人打电话么?  家人什么的?
Is there anyone you should call? Family?

14:34.680 --> 14:37.530
不  只有我一个
No. It's just me.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.950
那么  好吧... 有什么情况我会尽快通知你的
All right. Well, I'll let you know as soon as he's in recovery.

咱们今天要一箭三雕
We want the trifecta today.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.230

那家伙是个妄想狂  还有把枪
The guy was paranoid, he had a gun.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.750

-只是个孩子  伙计  -我知道  我很抱歉
-It's a kid, man.  -I know. I'm sorry.

15:56.420 --> 16:00.280

我现在只知道我害怕极了
And all I know is, I'm really scared.

你的荷尔蒙使你变得不正常了 你根本不曾好好考虑过
Your hormone things are out of whack. You're not thinking straight.

17:59.040 --> 18:03.220

26:00.740 --> 26:04.630

他昨晚去了医务室的那幢楼
He got to the infirmary building last night,

26:23.600 --> 26:25.110
通过老下水道

我就知道这么多
That's all I know.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.870

26:44.510 --> 26:47.290
我对你偷的东西不感兴趣
I don't care if you stole it. You can tell me.

26:47.300 --> 26:50.750
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.170
你在看什么?

27:10.590 --> 27:13.750
一会儿拐角处见

"要是我的话  我会求助于上帝 主会拯救我的
"For me, I would call upon God, and the Lord shall save me..."

29:32.340 --> 29:36.830
我大声呼喊  他就会听到我的声音
"...cry aloud, and he shall hear my voice..."

29:36.840 --> 29:43.410
他即将听到我的心声 他即将听到我的心声
"...he shall hear my voice... hear my voice..."

29:44.390 --> 29:47.860
他即将听到我的心声
"...he shall hear my voice..."

29:48.300 --> 29:51.660
他即将听到我的心声
"...hear my voice..."

30:22.000 --> 30:24.550
你干什么呢?
What are you doing?

30:24.560 --> 30:27.010
没事
Nothing.

30:29.010 --> 30:33.500

咱们到底什么时候才能离开这儿?
When are we getting out of here, exactly?

30:35.550 --> 30:36.960
我有权知道时间
I need to know the time.

30:36.970 --> 30:38.090
就快了
As soon as possible.

30:38.100 --> 30:40.040
"就快了" 可不是一个具体的时间
That's not a idiographic time.

30:40.050 --> 30:42.460
-你告诉阿布鲁奇时间了么?  -当然  因为他必须知道
-You tell Abruzzi the time?  -He needs to know.

30:42.470 --> 30:43.830
为什么他就必须知道而我却不能?
Why does he need to know and I don't?

30:43.840 --> 30:48.290
因为他要安排飞机的时间 你怎么对什么都这么好奇了?
Because he's arranging the plane.Why the sudden curiosity?

30:51.470 --> 30:55.850
你为什么非要知道那些 会给你带来危险的信息呢?
Why would you want to be responsible for potentially dangerous information?

30:55.860 --> 30:58.000
你知道的越少越好
The less you know, the better.

30:58.010 --> 31:01.260
这也是为了你好
It's for your own good.

或许再给你增加几年的刑期
Maybe even add a few years to your bit.

31:25.450 --> 31:26.410
我也不知道...

31:44.790 --> 31:47.190
现在...

31:49.610 --> 31:51.740
我相信你也听说过 "卑鄙小人"
I'm sure you've heard the word "rat".

31:51.750 --> 31:55.770
我也不喜欢告密者
I don't like it."Snitch", neither.

31:55.780 --> 31:59.110
我不想让你做那种人
Those sort of words aren't appropriate for what I need from you.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.960
我只是想了解一点点信息而已
What I need is a little information.

32:01.970 --> 32:05.720

Like when you're hanging out with Scofield...

32:06.010 --> 32:09.660
你只要告诉我他都说了些什么
Just come back and tell me what he said.

我还有一个汉堡 可惜  老兄  我已经饱了

你说呢  老兄? 要不要来个干酪汉堡?
So what do you say, kiddo? Want a cheeseburger?

32:28.890 --> 32:32.690
还是你想被关禁闭?
Or you want to go to the SHU?

32:39.300 --> 32:42.180
这就对了
That's my boy.

32:43.610 --> 32:45.650
嘿  亲爱的 你在这儿干什么呢?
Hey, honey, what are you doing here?

32:45.660 --> 32:47.850
还以为你走了呢
I thought you left.

32:47.860 --> 32:49.530
出什么事了?
What's wrong?

32:49.540 --> 32:53.530

33:09.590 --> 33:12.030
工作上的事
It's just work.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.360
我厌倦了整天在外面替别人卖命
I'm tired of being on the road working for somebody else

33:14.370 --> 33:18.630
而你却每天都在家独自一人
while you sit at home all alone night after night.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.240
我想过真正属于我们两个的生活
I want our lives to be about us.

33:20.240 --> 33:25.340

33:41.890 --> 33:44.060

37:56.920 --> 37:59.490

38:29.430 --> 38:31.980

还有他那个英俊的儿子?

38:38.550 --> 38:40.710
那可是他的命根子啊
His whole life in front of him.

38:40.720 --> 38:45.200
你竟然连孩子都不放过

After all I've done, maybe I do deserve to die.
