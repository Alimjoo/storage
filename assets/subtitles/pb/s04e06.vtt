11:05.730 --> 11:08.400
你的意思是
And what you're saying is...

11:08.460 --> 11:11.400
在我的报表里有一两个错误是很正常的
There might be a typo or two in my reports,

11:11.460 --> 11:14.600
但是我相信那些支票都兑现了
but I'm pretty sure those checks cleared.

11:14.660 --> 11:17.400
嗯
Uh-huh.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.700
好吧
Fair enough.

11:53.460 --> 11:55.560
你早上一直很忙啊  弗兰克
You've had a busy morning, Frank.

11:55.630 --> 11:57.960
非法进入  拘捕
Unlawful entry, resisting arrest.

11:58.030 --> 11:59.830
还不到午餐时间
It's not even lunchtime.

12:03.300 --> 12:06.300
你想吓唬我
You're trying to put the fear of God into me.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.800
你做到了
Mission accomplished.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.660
听着  警官
Listen, Sergeant,

12:11.730 --> 12:13.560
我对司法系统有一定的了解
I know a decent amount about the justice system,

12:13.630 --> 12:16.130
如果你愿意
enough to know that if you wanted to,

12:16.200 --> 12:18.230
现在不起诉我
you could drop this whole thing and...

12:18.300 --> 12:20.930
大家都会少很多的麻烦
it would save a lot of trouble for everybody, huh?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.900
这是什么电话
What kind of phone is this?

12:23.960 --> 12:27.360
是一个日本牌子  黑市买的
It's a, a Japanese brand. Off market.

12:27.430 --> 12:29.660
那你脚腕上的监视器又是怎么回事
What about the ankle monitor you're wearing?

12:31.760 --> 12:34.030
我跟你说的都是实话
I've been on the straight and narrow,

12:34.100 --> 12:36.330
这个东西过几天就会摘下来
and it's due to come off in a couple of days.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.900
按个手印
Press your fingers in the ink.

12:42.230 --> 12:45.160
我刚才烟瘾犯了  我是个大烟枪
I had two grand go up in smoke because of a bum gate.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.700
我的意思是  我刚才有一些紧张
I mean, I got a little upset for a second.

12:46.760 --> 12:47.960
你知道我什么意思  谁都会这么做的
You know what I mean? Who wouldn't?

12:49.230 --> 12:51.060
我们谈谈吧
Let's talk about this.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.400
那我们就谈谈你打了一个警察一拳
Should we talk about how you punched an officer first?

12:53.460 --> 12:57.160
而且你还想逃跑  你自己选一个吧
Or how you tried to flee the scene?Pick a felony.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.060
带他去拘留所
Take him to the holding cell.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.200
你说他被抓了
What do you mean he got arrested?

13:10.260 --> 13:10.690
出什么事了
W-What happened?

13:11.300 --> 13:12.500
说来话长
It's a long story,

13:12.560 --> 13:14.630
但是我们需要你把他和仪器都带出来
but we need you to get Mahone and the device out.

13:14.700 --> 13:15.630
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

13:15.700 --> 13:17.830
你以为每次你们出事故
What do you think,that every time you guys screw up,

13:17.900 --> 13:20.030
我就能帮你们全搞定
I can just magically make things disappear?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.730
我们不管你什么借口
We ain't interested in your excuses.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.030
你能不能做到
Can you do it or not?

13:23.100 --> 13:24.400
林肯  我过一会再打给你
Lincoln, y-you know what? I'll call you back.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.630
对不起  你是谁
Excuse me.Who are you?

13:26.700 --> 13:30.500
-你在干什么  -我是布莱恩  IT组的
-What is this? -I'm Brian.I work in the IT department.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.800
我们在服务器上发现
We were getting some registry inconsistencies

13:32.860 --> 13:34.030
有些和登记不一样的地方
on the server, so...

13:34.100 --> 13:36.530
我只是进行例行测试
I'm just running a few routine spot checks.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.860
你不问问我就进来了
So you just barge in here without asking?

13:38.930 --> 13:42.160
我有二级许可  看到没  这是我的工作
I have level two clearance. See?It's what I do.

13:42.230 --> 13:44.630
我进大家的办公室  我修理电脑
I go into people's offices, I fix their computers.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.700
我觉得你不在的时候把东西修好更好一点
I just figured it was better to do it when you weren't here.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.100
告诉你  你现在就给我出去
Well, you know what? You got to go.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.430
别再进来了
Don't come back in here.

13:50.500 --> 13:54.600
没问题  我全搞定了
Sure thing.You're all set.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.360
-怎么说  -赛尔夫正想办法
-So what's the word? -Self's on it.

14:04.430 --> 14:08.400
意思是  他会把马宏弄出来
On it, as in he's getting Mahone out?

14:08.460 --> 14:09.460
他说他来解决这个问题
He said he'd handle it.

14:09.530 --> 14:10.730
有什么要解决的
What's there to handle?

14:10.800 --> 14:13.800
我们这么大罪赛尔夫都能把我们弄出来
Self yanked us all out of prison for way bigger charges.

14:13.860 --> 14:15.630
搞定马宏的事  不是更简单吗
Getting Mahone out should be easy, shouldn't it?

14:15.700 --> 14:17.130
是啊
Yeah.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.500
我们还是来找下一个持卡人吧
Let's concentrate on finding the next cardholder.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.230
一旦我们拿回仪器  就继续复制
As soon as we get the device back, we'll move forward.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.500
你能告诉我们  我们现在都知道什么吗
Would you please walk us through what we know so far?

14:34.560 --> 14:35.900
好的
Sure.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.930
霍华德·斯库得利经营的昂格里逊公司
Howard Scuderi runs AgriSow,

14:38.000 --> 14:39.560
是世界上最大的农业集团
which is the world's largest agricultural conglomerate.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.500
在老挝有大量的不动产
It actually has huge holdings in Laos,

14:41.560 --> 14:42.800
而且现在还有通货膨胀
which, given the current inflation,

14:42.860 --> 14:45.960
意味着他们赚钱易如反掌
means that they are making money hand over fist.

15:09.830 --> 15:14.430
我的朋友在公园里玩
"My friends are playing at the park."

15:14.500 --> 15:16.130
亲爱的  你先去房间里
Sweetheart, why don't you go play in your room

15:16.200 --> 15:17.630
玩一会吧  好吗
for a little bit, okay?

15:22.530 --> 15:27.430
-现在感觉如何  -好多了
-How are you feeling? -Better.

15:27.500 --> 15:32.460
-我给你做了个三明治  -谢谢
-I, I made you a sandwich. -Thank you.

15:32.530 --> 15:35.460
你不告诉我发生了什么吗
Um, you never explained what happened.

15:37.660 --> 15:40.700
这样的
Well, um...

15:40.760 --> 15:43.660
我的车在沙漠中坏了
my car broke down in the middle of the desert, and, uh...

15:43.730 --> 15:47.600
而且附近都没有人  我的手机又没电了
there was no one around for miles,my cell phone was dead

15:48.700 --> 15:51.000
所以我就走来了  你有没有留着我在德国
So I walked here. Hey, do you still have that owl

15:51.060 --> 15:53.060
给你寄的那只猫头鹰
that I sent from Germany?

15:53.130 --> 15:54.330
留着
Yeah.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.700
-我想看看  -好的
-I need to see it.  -Okay.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.160
谢谢
Thank you.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.730
我的天啊  格雷琴
Oh, my God, Gretchen!

16:12.800 --> 16:14.760
这个  这个是真的枪吗
Is that, is that, that a real gun?

16:14.830 --> 16:16.830
是的
It is.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.130
-你为美国国税局工作吗  -不是
-You don't work for the IRS? -I don't.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.360
那你为谁工作
Who do you work for?

16:23.430 --> 16:26.660
现在  我为自己
As of now? Myself.

16:31.900 --> 16:35.130
他就读于长岛的杜鲁大学法学院
He attended Touro Law School in Long Island.

16:38.260 --> 16:40.030
在02年进去国土安全局之前
He spent the next 18 years

16:40.100 --> 16:43.960
他在内务部
bouncing around the D.O.J. and D.O.D. before being

16:44.030 --> 16:45.330
和国防部呆了18年
dumped on the doorstep of Homeland in '02.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.530
进来
Come in.

16:51.530 --> 16:53.330
将军
General.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.430
你发现什么了
What did you find out?

16:55.500 --> 16:58.900
我尝试进去他的用户账户
I tried accessing Self's user account,

16:58.960 --> 17:01.200
但他有一个非常复杂的防火墙系统
but he has a tricky firewall system in place.

17:01.260 --> 17:04.660
不是很容易破解  除非
There's no easy way to get past it,not without...

17:04.730 --> 17:06.400
我们花点精力
drawing attention.

17:06.460 --> 17:10.030
所以我们仍然不知道他为什么对我感兴趣
So we still don't know why he's interested in me.

17:10.100 --> 17:13.500
我需要更多的时间
Well, uh... maybe if you gave me more time.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.330
让我来吧
I'll look into it.

17:26.730 --> 17:28.660
听着  他对我很重要
Look, he's important to me.

17:28.730 --> 17:30.160
他为我工作
Okay, he's doing a job for me.

17:30.230 --> 17:32.230
你手下当着我的面  殴打我的人
Yeah, well, your CI punched one of my officers in the face.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.530
我明白
I understand...

17:33.600 --> 17:35.130
你要庆幸的是他不会受到很重的指控
You're lucky he's not being charged with worse.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.100
我替他向你道歉  好吗
I apologize for him.Okay?

17:38.160 --> 17:40.760
我想你帮我个忙
Look, I-I'm asking for a favor here,

17:40.830 --> 17:43.200
好吗  看在我们是同行
okay, from one badge to another.

17:43.260 --> 17:45.260
你最后一次审视你的徽章是什么时候
When was the last time you looked at your badge?

17:45.330 --> 17:48.000
我很清楚自己的是由洛杉矶颁发
'Cause I'm pretty sure mine says issued by the

17:48.060 --> 17:49.330
而不是由联邦政府颁发的
City of Los Angeles not the federal government,

17:49.400 --> 17:50.900
-除非你有法院的命令  -嘿
So unless you get a court order that... -Hey, hey!

17:50.960 --> 17:53.100
你要按照程序来吗  你要耍小聪明吗
You want to go that route? You want to get smart?

17:53.160 --> 17:54.860
当你和你的情人见面返回后
Huh? Want to get detained at the Guadalajara airport

17:54.930 --> 17:57.700
你想要在瓜达拉哈拉机场被拘留吗
when you're coming back from visiting your nana?

17:57.760 --> 17:58.860
这听起来怎么样
How does that sound?

17:58.930 --> 18:00.460
你有听过禁飞名单吗
Huh? You ever hear of a no-fly list?

18:00.530 --> 18:04.530
这是我部门可以做到的事情  明白吧
That's what my badge could do.Okay?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.430
还想知道其他我能做的吗
Want to see what else it could do?

18:11.830 --> 18:14.600
我都有些担心了
I was starting to worry.

18:14.660 --> 18:18.930
-签了这个  -好的
-Sign these. -Yeah.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.930
-这个不是释放令  -我需要你签了它
-These aren't release papers. -Well, I need you to sign that

18:24.000 --> 18:25.500
我才可以收集的你个人的
so I can collect your personal...

18:25.560 --> 18:27.800
-他们要查我的指纹  -你刚打了一个警察
-They're gonna run my prints, and once they... -You punched a cop.

18:27.860 --> 18:30.760
-是的  为了完成任务  -小声点  好吗
-Yeah, trying to save the mission. -Keep your voice down.Okay?

18:30.830 --> 18:32.300
我已经尽力了
I did the best I could do.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.100
你签了这个  我才可以拿到罗兰的设备
You need to sign those so I can collect Roland's device.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.830
你是要我放弃
You... you want me to give up the one thing

18:40.900 --> 18:43.300
我存在在这个组的意义
that makes me valuable to the team.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.660
你加入的时候就应该知道了
Yeah, you knew the deal when you came on board.

18:44.730 --> 18:47.160
为了这个我们都牺牲了很多
Okay, we all sacrificed a lot to get this far.

18:47.230 --> 18:48.400
就因为你的行为
You want to flush it down the toilet

18:48.460 --> 18:49.800
你想让这一切白费吗
because you made a bad move?

19:18.700 --> 19:21.530
明白了
Got it.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.300
赛尔夫拿到了设备  马宏还在监狱里
Self got the device.Mahone's still in jail.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.930
可马宏是我们组的一员啊
But Mahone-- he-he's part of the team.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
曾经是
Was.

19:29.060 --> 19:32.000
对于他还有他的孩子  我和你们一样感到悲伤
Look, I feel just as bad about his kid as everyone else,

19:32.060 --> 19:33.760
但我们不能为一个人而放弃任务
but we can't blow this mission on one person.

19:33.830 --> 19:34.760
这样吗
Oh, yeah?

19:34.830 --> 19:36.000
那么如果我明天被关了
So if I get popped tomorrow,

19:36.060 --> 19:37.800
你们也这样放弃我
you guys are just going to forget about me?

19:37.860 --> 19:38.800
是的
Yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
听着
Hey, listen.

19:42.060 --> 19:44.300
有个杀手正在追杀我们
An assassin is trying to hunt us down, okay?

19:44.360 --> 19:46.160
而通往城堡的钥匙以及
And that T-Bag character is out in the wind

19:46.230 --> 19:47.530
蒂博格都还不知所踪
with the keys to the castle.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.830
我们的问题已经够多了
We got enough problems

19:48.900 --> 19:50.900
不要在想那个关押在监狱里的混蛋了
without having to worry about this guy's ass in jail.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.500
你他妈给我闭嘴
You shut up.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.730
好了
Okay.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.000
阿历克斯用了假名  如果他们查他的指纹
Alex has an alias, but if they run his prints,

19:56.060 --> 19:57.330
-他就知道他是  -不  如果
-they're gonna find out that he's... -Not if--

19:57.400 --> 19:59.960
当他们查到他的指纹 他们就会查出他是谁
when they run his prints, they gonna figure out who he is

20:00.030 --> 20:01.960
并且查明他应该呆在重刑监狱
and that he's not in a supermax like he's supposed to be,

20:02.030 --> 20:03.630
他们不会意识到我们没
and then they're gonna realize  we're not...

20:03.700 --> 20:05.700
迈克尔
Michael.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.200
林肯说的对
Linc's right.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.660
我们别无选择  我们按原计划行事
We don't have a choice.We move forward with the plan.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.230
赛尔夫探员
Agent Self.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.500
我是克兰兹将军的人
I'm an associate of General Krantz.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.130
将军得到消息说
Word has gotten back to the General

20:52.200 --> 20:55.960
你正在查他
that you've been pulling information on him.

20:56.030 --> 20:58.160
赛尔夫先生  你为什么要如此
Why is that,Mr. Self?

20:59.230 --> 21:01.530
我是国土安全局的
I'm Homeland Security.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.760
我的工作就是保护像克兰兹这样
It's my job to protect people

21:02.830 --> 21:05.830
是恐怖分子的首要攻击目标
who make attractive terrorist targets--

21:05.900 --> 21:09.130
处于高度军事危险的人  免受伤害
people in upper ranks of military people like Krantz.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.660
能告诉我具体是什么威胁吗?
Is there a particular threat I should know about?

21:11.730 --> 21:15.500
或许你可以和我汇报下这个情况
Maybe you can debrief me on the situation.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.100
你是哪个部门的
What's your division?

21:18.160 --> 21:20.000
你能否出示下你的通行证等级
You want to give me your clearance level?

21:20.060 --> 21:27.360
-我直接受雇于将军  -好吧
-I'm a... hired contractor.  -Right.

21:27.430 --> 21:30.400
我通常不会把机密信息
Well,I usually don't make a habit of giving civilians who

21:30.460 --> 21:33.030
透露给在地下停车场
corner me in underground parking structures

21:33.100 --> 21:36.730
逼问我的平民  懂了吗?
classified information.Okay?

21:36.800 --> 21:39.160
如果将军还有其他疑问  让他打电话给我
So if the General has a problem,he can call me.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.730
你还有什么要对我说的吗?
Is there something else you want to say to me?

21:43.800 --> 21:47.460
我想我们的首次交谈还算顺利
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

21:47.530 --> 21:51.030
我只是来给你点友情建议
I'm just here to give you a little friendly advice.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.600
什么建议?
What's that?

21:52.660 --> 21:56.200
将军喜欢有自己的隐私
The General-- he likes his privacy.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.800
仅此而已
That's all.

22:08.500 --> 22:13.500
洛杉矶警局 停车场 11号

22:20.130 --> 22:22.100
没错 他就是怀特
Yes, that was Wyatt.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.900
我告诉你这个是因为
I gotta tell you,I'm not a big fan

22:24.960 --> 22:26.930
我不想被人爆了头
of almost catching a bullet in my head.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.800
现在你该知道这种感受了吧
Well,now you know what it's like.

22:32.960 --> 22:36.060
你了解马宏多少
So,how well do you know Mahone?

22:36.130 --> 22:39.900
我只知道他想搞垮"公司"就像我们那么强烈
I know he wants to take down the Company just as much as we do.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
你还知道他是负有重大责任
You also realize he's a major liability.

22:42.060 --> 22:45.160
我的意思是  如果怀特能找到我  他也能找到马宏
I mean,if Wyatt could find me,he could find Mahone.

22:45.230 --> 22:46.300
并且...
And then people...

22:46.360 --> 22:50.030
-那就把他弄出监狱  -我说了我做不到
-So get him out. -I told you I can't.

22:50.100 --> 22:56.100
但是我能找到他  我是说我能联系上他
But I can get to him.I mean,he can be touched.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.900
我也不知道 或许马宏是条汉子
I don't know,maybe Mahone is a stand-up guy.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.060
或许他会供出我们来达到他的目的
Or maybe he likes to run his mouth to work an angle,

23:01.130 --> 23:07.400
我不确定  但如果需要的话  我能除掉他
I'm not sure.But if need be,I can get rid of that angle.

23:07.460 --> 23:12.800
-我能终结了这个威胁  -不予考虑
-I can eliminate that threat.-That's not an option.

23:12.860 --> 23:14.800
不  考虑一下
Oh,yes it is.Okay,

23:14.860 --> 23:20.200
因为如果要你选  是杀了他还是我们全玩儿完...
because if a choice has to be made between him or us...

23:27.600 --> 23:32.530
弗兰克  给你带好消息来了
Hey,Frank.Got some good news.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.960
是吗  什么好消息
Oh,yeah,what's that?

23:35.030 --> 23:37.000
我能放了你
I can cut you a break.

23:39.060 --> 23:41.030
就这么简单吗
As easy as that?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.360
我和那个地铁站经理说过了
Spoke with the manager down at the racetrack.

23:44.430 --> 23:46.500
他说一个比你小10岁左右的
Said you were spotted with another male Caucasian

23:46.560 --> 23:48.530
白种人和你一起到过那
about ten years your junior.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.460
说的没错吧
That sound about right?

23:50.530 --> 23:51.300
警察来了
Here come the cops.

23:51.360 --> 23:54.600
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

23:54.660 --> 23:55.930
到底怎么回事
What was it?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.960
你们两个在那准备袭击押运车
The two of you were gonna go in there,rob the vault?

23:58.030 --> 24:00.700
抢了现金就跑对吗
Grab as much cash and get out?

24:00.760 --> 24:01.730
总得有个望风的
Someone has to be lookout.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.800
我会看着的 快走!
I'll take care of it. Go!

24:02.860 --> 24:06.330
瞧  或许你妻子正在家里等着你
Look.Maybe you got a wife to get home too.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.330
你的整个家都在等你
Family.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.700
如果你愿意供出你的同伙
If you're willing to give me the name of your accomplice

24:11.760 --> 24:13.130
我想我们可以减轻对你的指控
I think we can change your charges.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.200
我们是一伙的 你知道
I thought we worked together,you know.

24:14.260 --> 24:16.500
-互相帮助  -你得靠你自己了
-Help each other out.-You're on your own.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.560
如果你改变主意了就叫我
You holler if you change your mind.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.230
现在我们谈谈这第五个持卡人
All right,let's talk about the fifth cardholder.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.400
将军正要求
The General is requiring

24:32.460 --> 24:35.560
所有持卡人必须把卡时刻带在自己身边
all the cardholders to have their cards on them at all times,

24:35.630 --> 24:38.560
所以斯库得利也一定把卡带在身上
so Scuderi will have his card,too.

24:38.630 --> 24:40.900
斯库得利的保安时刻巡视着他房子的四周
Now,Scuderi has major security around his house.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.560
大围墙围着他的房子  还有一群狗看着
Big fence,lots of guard dogs.

24:42.630 --> 24:44.200
文件在哪
Where are the documents?

24:44.260 --> 24:45.860
这些是从县督察员办公室拿来的
These are from the county surveyor's office.

24:45.930 --> 24:47.760
这是他房子的布局图
It shows the layout of his property,

24:47.830 --> 24:49.930
以及他接近街道处的所有建筑
and its proximity to every other house on his street.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.960
他有着绝对顶级的
He has-- surprise,surprise--

24:52.030 --> 24:53.960
电子警报系统
a top of the line electronic alarm system

24:54.030 --> 24:57.300
一旦有人入侵  警报就会启动
that will alert him if there's a breach in the structure.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.730
如果我切断电源  警报就会消除
If we cut the power-- the alarm goes off.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.600
如果我们用突增的瞬间电压  增加电力供应
if we double the power with a voltage spike

25:02.660 --> 25:04.860
这个警报系统会为了保护自身装置
the alarm system,in order to protect itself

25:04.890 --> 25:06.930
免受超载 它会自动关闭
against an overload, will shut itself down.

25:06.930 --> 25:08.100
我们就那么进去
And that's how we're getting in.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.130
然后呢
Then what?

25:09.200 --> 25:12.030
我知道该怎么做  每人搞定自己那部分
Look, I know what the score is.It's every man for himself.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.560
你慢了就完蛋  真他妈难搞
You get left behind you get locked up.Tough titties.

25:14.630 --> 25:16.060
现在我跟其他人一样都签了字
Now, I signed on the dotted line

25:16.130 --> 25:17.530
我想清楚的知道
like everyone else and I want to know exactly

25:17.600 --> 25:18.760
我该做什么
what I'm doing on this job.

25:18.830 --> 25:21.800
我和贝里克一起
I'm with Bellick on this one.

25:21.860 --> 25:23.760
我觉得在警察来之前
You know, maybe

25:23.830 --> 25:25.500
我们得有个计划
we should have a plan for when the cops get here

25:25.560 --> 25:28.260
因为如果马宏告密的话他们很快就会回来
'cause if Mahone squeals they're gonna come real quick.

25:28.330 --> 25:30.500
他是联邦政府官员  你觉得他一生中
He's a Fed-- how many deals

25:30.560 --> 25:32.460
作过多少交易
do you think this guy's made in his life?

25:32.530 --> 25:34.330
你觉得他会夹起尾巴
You think he's just gonna tuck tail between his...

25:34.400 --> 25:35.600
闭嘴
Shut up.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.160
我们大可以在这坐着讨论一天
Look, we can sit here and debate

25:38.230 --> 25:41.000
看马宏会做或不会做什么
what Mahone is or is not gonna do for the rest of the day,

25:41.060 --> 25:42.230
但问题是
but it comes down to this:

25:42.300 --> 25:45.130
我们不能把他从警局给弄出来
we cannot break him out of a police station.

25:49.830 --> 25:52.760
一  二
One... two...

25:52.830 --> 25:55.260
三  四  五  六
three, four, five, six--

25:55.330 --> 25:57.300
不  太大了
No. Too big.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.330
八乘以十
Eight by ten.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.530
这是我能弄到的最低限度
This is the lowest gauge I could get.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.030
好极了
It's perfect.

26:56.760 --> 27:03.900
我觉得  我觉得我们只能让他呆监狱里了
I guess, uh...I guess we're gonna leave him in jail.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.200
你是在陈述还是在问
Is that a statement or a question?

27:06.260 --> 27:09.700
如果阿历克斯有什么事的话
It's just if something happens to Alex--

27:09.760 --> 27:13.500
如果公司找到他
if, uh, if the Company finds him...

27:13.560 --> 27:16.760
如果角色互换  换做是你被抓
If the roles were reversed and you were the one locked up,

27:16.830 --> 27:19.930
你觉得阿历克斯会冒险来救你吗
you really think Alex would risk it all to get you out?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.930
我不知道
I mean, I don't know.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.760
但是  他是联邦探员
But...he was a federal agent.

27:25.830 --> 27:28.100
我觉得他会有始有终
I think he'd finish what he started.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.560
我相信他会设法搞垮公司
I think he'd bring the Company down.

28:04.030 --> 28:06.760
有什么能帮您吗
Can I help you with something?

28:06.830 --> 28:09.360
我是来找弗兰克·斯万的
Yes, I-I'm here to see Frank Zwan.

28:09.430 --> 28:10.730
我是他们家世交
I'm a family friend.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.600
恐怕你现在不能见他
I'm afraid you can't see him right now.

28:12.660 --> 28:14.630
他正要接受传讯
He's about to be transferred for his arraignment.

28:23.230 --> 28:27.460
我是想来提供精神支持的
Actually, I'd like to be there for moral support.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.760
能告诉我法庭在哪吗
Could you tell me where's the court house?

28:47.230 --> 28:49.200
喂
Hello?

28:49.260 --> 28:51.730
迈克尔
Michael.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.030
阿历克斯  很抱歉
Alex, look, I'm sorry.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.030
他发现我了
He found me.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.660
怀特  他出现在警局
Wyatt-- He showed up at the station house

28:59.730 --> 29:01.630
他们抓住了我  我不知道他怎么找到我的
where they're holding me. I don't know how he did it.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.100
不知道他怎么查出来了
I don't know how he figured it out.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
我打电话给赛尔夫
Let me call Agent Self.

29:04.230 --> 29:05.200
不  迈克尔  听着
No, Michael, listen...

29:05.260 --> 29:06.630
不  可能他们会转移你
No, maybe he can get you moved.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.100
我完了  全完了
It's-it's over for me. It's done.

29:08.160 --> 29:11.060
我什么都不会说的
It's-- and I'm not gonna say anything about anything.

29:11.130 --> 29:13.360
但你得答应我件事  可以吗
But you need to promise me something, okay?

29:13.460 --> 29:17.200
-好的  是什么  -答应我
-Okay, what? -Promise me...

29:17.260 --> 29:21.230
你去找怀特  杀了那狗娘养的
that you will get to Wyatt and you'll kill the son of a bitch.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.830
然后打电话给帕姆
And then you'll call Pam

29:23.900 --> 29:26.500
告诉她我死了
and you'll tell her that he's gone.

29:26.560 --> 29:29.300
好的
All right.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.330
我答应你
I promise.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.560
好  再见
Ok. Bye.

29:42.930 --> 29:49.560
准备好了吗  迈克尔
You ready to go?Michael?

29:51.930 --> 29:53.860
我是他老婆
I'm his wife.

29:53.930 --> 29:56.360
抱歉  我还是没很震惊
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still in shock.

29:56.430 --> 29:58.360
我下午过来
I'll be down this afternoon.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.530
谢谢
Thank you.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.200
你到底在干嘛
Who are you?

30:01.260 --> 30:03.460
我有事要处理
I just have some things I need to take care of.

30:03.530 --> 30:05.500
你不用担心
You don't need to worry.

30:10.430 --> 30:14.360
你总是把人拒之于外
You have this...switch inside you.

30:14.430 --> 30:16.360
我不知道你是怎么会
I don't know how you could just...

30:16.430 --> 30:18.430
自我封闭起来的
shut yourself off.

30:18.500 --> 30:23.430
妈妈死的时候你这样  对艾米丽也是这样
You did it when Mom died.Did it with Emily.

30:25.460 --> 30:27.300
这么对我
Did it with me.

30:29.330 --> 30:37.560
我这么做是因为  我就是这样的
I do it because it's...it's just who I am.

30:37.630 --> 30:41.800
不  不是的  以前你
No, it's not.You used to be...

30:41.860 --> 30:48.130
我得走了  但谢谢你  为了这一切
I have to go.But thank you... for everything.

30:50.330 --> 30:53.460
你不是来带她走的
So, you're not here to take her?

30:53.530 --> 30:55.730
如果我能个好母亲
If I was capable of being her mother,

30:55.800 --> 30:57.500
我就不会把监护权给你了
I wouldn't have given you custody.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.200
你会听话的  是不是
You be a good girl, okay?

31:09.330 --> 31:13.500
-艾米丽  再见  -婶婶再见
-Bye, Emily. -Bye, Auntie.

31:22.230 --> 31:24.230
我爱你
I love you.

31:29.130 --> 31:32.730
-我们还能再见面吗  -我不知道
-Will we see you again? -I don't know.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.360
要是去南边就给我电话
Call me if it goes south.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.860
亲爱的  是我  我在杂货店
Hey,honey.it's me.I'm at the grocery store.

32:28.860 --> 32:31.860
我打算做烤猪排
I was planning to make those grilled pork chops,

32:31.930 --> 32:34.860
除非你不想吃
unless you're not in the mood for them.

32:34.930 --> 32:36.960
希望你今天愉快
I hope you're having a great day.

32:52.230 --> 32:53.960
你们在干什么
Hey, what are you guys doing?

32:54.030 --> 32:56.700
我们完成了再给你电话
We'll call you when we're done.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.600
等等
Wait.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.030
你们在哪
Where are you guys?

33:02.030 --> 33:02.850
马上好了
Almost ready.

34:31.430 --> 34:33.400
你有麻烦了
You have a problem.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.030
怎么了
What's that?

34:36.800 --> 34:39.230
有什么能效劳的
What can I do you for?

34:39.300 --> 34:41.400
我刚刚发现了更多不一致的地方
I just-- I've found some more inconsistencies

34:41.460 --> 34:45.630
你的销售报告里  实际上  非常多
in your sales reports.Actually, many more.

34:45.700 --> 34:50.800
事实上  有点像是欺诈
In fact...kind of looks like fraud, actually.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.760
我从一开始就知道你很垃圾
I knew you were rotten from the beginning.

34:55.830 --> 34:57.830
我要你5分钟内到我办公室
I want you in my office in five minutes

34:57.900 --> 34:59.260
给我解释清楚
to walk me through this,

34:59.330 --> 35:01.460
你要是做不到
and if you can't,

35:01.530 --> 35:04.060
我就打电话给当局
well, I'm gonna call the authorities.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.230
你在干什么
What are you doing?

35:23.300 --> 35:25.330
很高兴认识你  甜心
Nice knowing you, sugar.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.330
科尔  等等

35:35.500 --> 35:38.530
他去世时我在国外
I was traveling abroad when he passed away.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.730
同样  我很抱歉
Again, I'm very sorry.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.460
这是你丈夫吗
Is this your husband?

35:49.230 --> 35:51.630
是的
Yes.

35:51.700 --> 35:52.960
我要看到证明
I need to see some identification

35:53.030 --> 35:56.430
我才能签字移交他的私人物品给你
so I can sign over his personal belongings to you.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.700
你跟你爱人的姓氏不同
So... you and your spouse had different last names?

36:05.760 --> 36:07.030
没错
That's correct.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.260
我知道这很麻烦
I realize this is an inconvenience,

36:08.330 --> 36:10.460
但我得看到其他能证明
but I need to see other documentation

36:10.530 --> 36:11.630
你们已婚的文件
proving you were married.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.960
你知道我经历过什么事吗
Do you have any idea what I've been through?

36:17.030 --> 36:21.330
抱歉  女士  规定就是规定
I'm sorry, ma'am.Rules are rules.

36:37.560 --> 36:41.660

卧房也准备好了  谢谢

37:07.860 --> 37:09.830
我是弗兰克·斯万的代表
Hi, I'm, uh, representing Frank Zwan.

37:09.900 --> 37:11.660
我要他的资料
I'm going to need his jacket from you.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.230
他们通知我  说他没钱请律师
I've been informed he's going indigent.

37:13.300 --> 37:14.460
以前是
Uh, he was.

37:14.530 --> 37:15.800
她妈妈在圣巴巴拉市  可有的是钱
His mother in Santa Barbara, however, is not,

37:15.860 --> 37:17.030
她今天早上雇了我
