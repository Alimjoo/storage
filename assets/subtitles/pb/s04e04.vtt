00:00.230 --> 00:02.660
《越狱》剧情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

00:03.230 --> 00:05.260
他们称它锡拉
They refer to it as "Scylla."

00:05.300 --> 00:07.660
是一本"公司"的黑皮书
It's like the company's black book.

00:06.770 --> 00:06.770


00:07.700 --> 00:10.200
那是什么  可以在十码内获取
What's that? Wireless hard drive that swallows up

00:10.230 --> 00:12.130
任何电子信息的无线硬盘
any electronic data within ten feet of it.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.960
能接收储存在锡拉里的信息吗
And the information embedded in Scylla?

00:14.000 --> 00:15.700
如果靠得够近的话
If we can get close enough...

00:15.730 --> 00:17.460
就能得到了
it's ours.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.160
如果锡拉是一张饼
If Scylla was like a pizza,

00:19.200 --> 00:20.530
我们只得到了一块
all we got's a slice.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.330
锡拉不只一张卡
So Scylla isn't one card,

00:22.360 --> 00:23.630
是六张
it's six.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.000
他们杀了我儿子
They killed my boy.

00:25.030 --> 00:27.500
我要找出谁是干的
I need to find out who did it.

00:27.530 --> 00:29.630
婊子  天亮了
Rise and shine, bitch.

00:29.660 --> 00:30.430
吃早饭了
Breakfast.

00:32.030 --> 00:32.730
喂
Hello?

00:32.760 --> 00:33.530
科尔·普发
Cole Pfeiffer,

00:33.560 --> 00:34.700
我是  格里高里·怀特
Gregory White here.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.800
我会明天早上在伽特公司见你
I'll see you at GATE first thing tomorrow.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.100
而且  我会亲自给你
And I will personally hand you

00:38.130 --> 00:39.460
你的花红支票
your bonus check.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.930
莎拉·唐克雷蒂在很安全的地方
Sara Tancredi's

00:40.960 --> 00:42.800
是不是 布鲁斯
somewhere safe, ist she, Bruce?

00:45.660 --> 00:47.700
告诉我  莎拉在什么地方
So tell me, where is Sara?

00:49.130 --> 00:50.400
洛杉矶
Los Angeles?

00:50.430 --> 00:52.300
干得好
Good job.

00:52.330 --> 00:53.300
这不仅是两个锡拉持卡人
It wasn't a meeting

00:53.330 --> 00:55.700
会面  赛尔夫探员
between two Scylla cardholders, Agent Self.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.100
所有
It was a meeting

00:57.130 --> 00:58.700
六个持卡人都在那儿
between all six cardholders.

00:58.730 --> 01:00.330
所以我们已经知道
So now we know who has the other

01:00.360 --> 01:01.630
其他五张卡在谁手里
five cards.

01:12.900 --> 01:16.200
嘿  你从录像中看出什么了吗？
Hey. You got anything off the video?

01:16.230 --> 01:19.000
这是在50码外用手机录的
It's a camera phone 50 feet away.

01:19.030 --> 01:21.030
所以  画面比较粗糙
So, it's pretty grainy.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.000
还在打印
Still printing.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.430
你坐过那种船吗
You ever been on one of those?

01:28.460 --> 01:30.360
是的
Yeah.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.430
那个时候我还是个酒鬼
I was still drinking at the time,

01:32.460 --> 01:33.830
所以  我没什么太多的印象
so I don't remember much.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.000
嗯
Um,

01:35.030 --> 01:37.000
他们说我那时总出丑
told I was a lot of fun.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.030
你呢
You?

01:39.060 --> 01:40.930
不
No.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.130
我以前住的地方没有多少船
Not a lot of yachts where I'm from.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.960
我一直都向往住在那种船上
I always kind of wanted to live on one.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.800
我一直以为面朝大海是件不错的事
I thought it'd be nice to have the ocean as my front yard.

01:49.830 --> 01:52.460
现在大海就近在你眼前
The ocean is your front yard.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.600
你觉得我以前做的纸鸭子怎么样
What's wrong with the SS Minnow back there?

01:57.630 --> 01:58.830
挺好的
Nothing.

01:58.860 --> 02:01.760
你难道真想把那个放到水上
You really want to drop that thing in the water someday

02:01.800 --> 02:03.860
让它带着你去神秘的地方
and sail off to parts unknown?

02:03.900 --> 02:05.200
为什么不呢
Yeah, why not?

02:05.230 --> 02:06.930
只要你和我在一起
As long as it's you and me.

02:08.660 --> 02:11.530
你嘴真甜
I like the sound of that.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.230
嘿 伙计
Yo, papi.

02:14.030 --> 02:15.300
有发现了
We got something.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.060
总有那么一天的
One day.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.130
发现了什么
What've we got?

02:32.160 --> 02:35.930
我们发现了一张车牌
Uh, we got a, we got a license plate.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.900
从手机录像里打印出来的
It's a printout from the camera phone.

02:37.930 --> 02:39.160
数字很不清楚
The numbers are

02:39.200 --> 02:41.230
所有的东西都不清楚
fuzzy, though. The whole damn thing's fuzzy.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.160
不要管那车牌号了
Forget the numbers.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.360
车牌旁边是什么
What's that next to the plate?

02:43.400 --> 02:44.330
看起来是一张贴纸
Looks like a sticker.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.800
-DMV?  -那是一面旗
-DMV? -That's a flag.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.200
是外交部的车牌
It's a diplomatic plate.

02:47.230 --> 02:48.130
伙计们 六个P
The Six Ps, guys.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.360
以前我在福克斯河管理32个
When I supervised 32 COs

02:49.400 --> 02:52.400
小组的时候  就是全靠这六个p来实现的
back at Fox River-- it was the Six Ps made it happen.

02:52.430 --> 02:53.600
你能放大吗
Can you blow it up?

02:53.630 --> 02:55.030
我得仔细看看
I need to see more detail.

02:55.060 --> 02:56.160
我正在做了
I'm already on it.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.830
准备  计划  预防
Prior, Planning, Prevents,

02:57.860 --> 02:59.330
无视  贬低  表现
-Piss-Poor, Performance. -How about you

02:59.360 --> 03:01.360
别抱怨了  说说你的想法
quit shaking your ass and say what's on your mind?

03:01.400 --> 03:03.030
那个第二步
The second step.

03:03.060 --> 03:04.130
破解内容
Deciphering the cards.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.830
入侵行动  我们需要计划一下
The break-in. We need to plan.

03:05.860 --> 03:08.160
赛尔夫探员会给我们那些资料
Agent Self will provide that information.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.060
你和惠斯勒在一起呆过
You worked with Whistler.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.600
他有没有提过一个地点
Didn't he say anything about a location?

03:11.630 --> 03:13.660
会不会是在那本关于鸟的书上
Wasn't that in his bird book?

03:13.700 --> 03:15.030
但是在帝博格手里
Which T-Bag has.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.430
如果他活着逃出了索纳监狱
If he made it out of Sona alive.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.730
找到突破口根本没有意义
Finding where the break-in is doesn't mean anything

03:19.760 --> 03:21.100
因为我们没有那些卡
if we don't have the cards.

03:21.130 --> 03:22.630
这就是那面旗
Here's your flag.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.430
阿尔及利亚?  土耳其
Algeria? Turkey.

03:27.630 --> 03:30.000
找到土耳其领事馆在哪里
Find out where the Turkish Consul is in town.

03:30.030 --> 03:32.430
听着  到你出场了
You know what? Get with the program.

03:32.460 --> 03:33.430
你去找
You're up.

03:33.460 --> 03:35.360
他的名字是埃罗·特巴克
Uh, his name's Erol Tabak.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.200
-领事馆在市中心 -但是
-Consulate is downtown. -Yeah, but

03:37.230 --> 03:38.400
我们进不去领事馆
we can't get into the consulate.

03:38.430 --> 03:40.830
我们可以从那里开始跟踪他
We can follow him from there.

03:40.860 --> 03:42.660
迈克
Michael.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.900
我想留下来研究一下录像
I'm gonna stay back and work on the video.

03:45.930 --> 03:47.630
好的
Okay.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.000
-会有那么一天的  -一定会
-One day. -one day.

04:14.330 --> 04:16.330

这就是我们要做到的
That's what we're doing here.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.600
这就是我们伽特公司要做到的
That's what we're doing here at GATE.

04:26.630 --> 04:28.500
我会鼓励你们所有人
And I would encourage all of you to...

04:28.530 --> 04:30.200
嗯
Huh.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.960
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

04:36.000 --> 04:36.960
...f-e-r.
...f-e-r.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.300
P-f-e-i-f...
P-f-e-i-f...

04:38.330 --> 04:40.430
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.530
外交官平时都干什么
What do diplomats usually do?

04:47.560 --> 04:49.660
也没什么事  就是能随意停车
Not a whole lot, but they park anywhere they want.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.900
把这个放在车前面
Put this on the dash.

04:55.630 --> 04:57.700
我们还能再靠近点吗
Can we get any closer?

05:04.700 --> 05:06.230
就是他
That's our guy.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.100
是吗
Yeah?

05:10.130 --> 05:11.500
正在拷贝
We're copying.

05:11.530 --> 05:12.800
卡在他身上
He's got the card on him.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.060
太好了
Hell yes.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.200
他老婆吗
That's his wife?

05:18.230 --> 05:19.560
算我一个
Sign me up.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.930
没信号了
You lost it.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.100
怎么可能
How?

05:27.130 --> 05:28.160
我也不知道
Dude, I don't know

05:28.200 --> 05:29.460
我只能告诉你没有信号了
what to tell you other than you lost it.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.230
什么都没有
It's gone, man.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.130
没信号了
We lost it.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.200
什么
What!

05:32.230 --> 05:33.200
怎么可能收不到
How did we lose him?

05:33.230 --> 05:34.260
我们就在他旁边
We're right next to him.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.760
卡不在他那儿
He's not the cardholder.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.060
在他老婆那儿
She is.

05:48.730 --> 05:51.260
我们最好在被发现之前赶快离开
We gotta get out here now before we get made.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.400
快点  走  走
Come on, go! Go!

You know what we've got in common, right?

06:42.350 --> 06:43.380

What?

06:43.420 --> 06:44.950
我们都活在一个
We both live in the real world

06:44.980 --> 06:46.680
没人理解现实世界里
as opposed to these other knuckleheads.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.180
你刚才说到
So that whole prior planning

06:48.220 --> 06:49.480
事前准备的事
thing you were talking about,

06:49.520 --> 06:51.520
如果你有什么计划
if you got something on your mind

06:51.550 --> 06:53.480
别人不关心  但你可以告诉我  好吗
and no one else is interested, you just run it by me, okay?

06:53.520 --> 06:54.580
我们先这么说好
And we'll just leave it at that.

06:54.620 --> 06:56.450
怎么样
All right.

07:08.050 --> 07:09.380
喂
Hello?

07:09.420 --> 07:10.420

Hey, it's Don Self.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.920
听着
Listen, um,

07:13.950 --> 07:16.020
我有些坏消息
I have some bad news.

07:17.180 --> 07:18.620
今天早上 在布鲁斯·班尼特的公寓里
Bruce Bennett was found dead

07:18.650 --> 07:20.150
发现他被杀了
in his apartment this morning.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.350
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.980
丽莎  请进

07:34.020 --> 07:35.720
不会耽误太久
This will be quick.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.950
我知道你有你的安排
I know you're on a schedule.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.820
那个地方的价值现在是1亿
The value of the kip is at ten right now.

07:43.850 --> 07:46.320
如果涨到1亿5千万 我会马上让你知道
I'll let you know as soon as it reaches 15.

07:46.350 --> 07:48.650
当那个时候  你要马上离开
At that point, you'll have to leave immediately.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.280
我已经整理好行李了
I have my bags with me.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.220
我现在就能走
I could go now.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.520
你今晚不是还要露面吗
Don't you have that event tonight?

07:53.550 --> 07:55.320
是的
Yes.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.450
但我
But I...

07:56.480 --> 07:58.820
该露面的时候 还是要露面的
It's important to keep up appearances.

07:58.850 --> 08:00.320
这样就不会有人怀疑
Not arouse suspicion.

08:00.350 --> 08:02.520
好吧
Fine.

08:02.550 --> 08:06.380
我对你的领导能力很有信心 丽莎
I have no doubt in your leadership

08:06.420 --> 08:07.750
-但是  丽莎  -很好
-abilities, Lisa, but... -Good.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.620

Nor do I.

08:09.650 --> 08:12.180
所以 我现在就走了
So I won't keep you any longer.

08:14.350 --> 08:15.980
请
Please...

08:16.020 --> 08:18.180
注意安全
be safe.

08:28.180 --> 08:30.220
她出来了
There she is.

08:32.820 --> 08:35.120
好吧  做你该做的
All right, do what you gotta do.

08:35.150 --> 08:37.480
跟着她两分钟  这样才能拷贝卡
Be next to her for two minutes so the device can copy the card.

08:37.520 --> 08:38.580
我能搞定
I'll get it.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.220
坐下 坐下
Take a seat. Take a seat.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.980
看见那三个穿西装的了吗
See the three suits?

08:45.020 --> 08:46.980
像三角一样在她周围
Forming a triangle around her?

08:47.020 --> 08:48.320
那些是私人保镖
Those are private contractors.

08:48.350 --> 08:49.480
"公司"只会在保护
The Company would only do that

08:49.520 --> 08:50.720
重要人物的时候才这么做
for the inner circle.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.320
我们不可能接近她
We're not getting anywhere near that lady.

08:52.350 --> 08:53.720
-今天不行   -真倒霉
-Not today. -Great.

09:06.410 --> 09:07.580
怎么了
What's wrong?

09:52.880 --> 09:55.280
嘿  帝博格
Hey, Teddy.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.380
遇到老熟人了

11:24.880 --> 11:26.620
她与这事无关
She's irrelevant.

11:26.650 --> 11:29.020
和斯科菲尔德有关
Not to Scofield.

11:29.050 --> 11:33.020
如果有人知道他在哪  肯定是她
If anyone knows what rock he's hiding under, it's her.

我要让她说实话
I'm having her softened up,

11:37.620 --> 11:40.420
但是我觉得她活着有什么意义

11:40.450 --> 11:41.920
我觉得你不应该让

11:43.580 --> 11:45.380

11:45.420 --> 11:47.180

It's not where he is. It's what he's doing.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.150

12:24.550 --> 12:25.580
