00:03.100 --> 00:05.850
-迈克尔  那人不是我杀的  -可证据确凿
-I didn't kill that man Michael.  -The evidence says you did.

00:05.860 --> 00:08.400
我是被陷害的
I was set up.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.370
把枪放下!
Put down your weapon.

00:10.380 --> 00:13.460
本席在此宣判 你入狱服刑
I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell.

00:13.470 --> 00:15.600
我想找个人  他叫林肯·布伦斯
I'm looking for someone guy named Lincoln Burrows.

00:15.610 --> 00:17.120
杀害副总统哥哥的那个?
Man killed the vice president's brother.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.920
你为什么这样急着见布伦斯?
Why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?

00:18.930 --> 00:20.010
他是我哥哥
'Cause he's my brother.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.190
-我要把你弄出去  -不可能
-I'm getting you out of here.  -It's impossible.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.420
除非这个地方是你设计的 你说呢
Not if you designed the place,it isn't

00:24.430 --> 00:25.790
你看过蓝图了?
You've seen the blueprints.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.070
不仅如此
Better than that.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.970
我都纹在身上了
I've got 'em on me.

00:28.980 --> 00:30.480
有个好管闲事的律师
There's a lawyer poking around.

00:30.490 --> 00:31.810
多诺万小姐
Ms Donovan?

00:31.820 --> 00:33.320
我没想吓倒您
 I didn't mean to scare you.

00:33.330 --> 00:34.100
不见了!
It's gone.

00:34.110 --> 00:35.570
都谁还有这里的钥匙?
Does anyone else have a key to this place?

00:35.580 --> 00:36.990
你当时也在的  记得么?
You were here.remember?

00:37.000 --> 00:41.170
我走过橱柜  然后
I walked over to the cabinet and I...

00:46.780 --> 00:49.480
对我们的小朋友有什么意见么?
Got an issue with our little friend over there?

00:49.490 --> 00:54.560
是时候给他点颜色看看了
Yeah. Maybe it's time I lit up that leather once and for all, huh?

00:54.570 --> 00:55.840
发生了什么事?
What happened?

00:55.850 --> 00:57.590
别逼我骗你
Don't make me lie to you.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.680
你听说了么?
You heard the news, didn't you?

00:58.690 --> 00:59.720
听说什么?
No. What?

00:59.730 --> 01:01.660
-他们是兄弟  -谁?
-They're brothers.  -Who?

01:01.670 --> 01:05.140
-布伦斯 和斯科菲尔德  -迈克尔·斯科菲尔德?
-Burrows and Scofield.  -Michael Scofield?

01:05.150 --> 01:07.950
今晚打算再到墙那边 看看能否顺利到达屋顶
I'm going into the walls tonight,see if I can access the roof.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.180
不要给布伦斯留下丝毫希望
Take the only thing Burrows has left.

01:10.190 --> 01:14.510
在监狱里行刑不一定非要通过电椅
The chair isn't the only way to take a man's life in prison.

01:30.950 --> 01:35.260
那就再玩几次吧  回来后就走
Just a few more rides.Then you have to wrap it up.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.770
亚当已经长大了?
Wow. Adam's getting bigger.

01:39.780 --> 01:42.140
-10岁了?  -这里说话不方便
-Ten.  -Not here.

01:42.150 --> 01:45.400
帮我们个忙
We need a favour.

01:45.410 --> 01:47.420
你也知道 我早就洗手不干了
been out of the life for years,you know that.

01:47.430 --> 01:48.200
我知道
I know.

01:48.210 --> 01:49.770
可问题是  帝蒙  谁又会相信你呢
Problem is, Diamond, no one's gonna believe that

01:49.780 --> 01:51.810
尤其是当我把包里的海洛因
if I take the heroin in my pocket

01:51.820 --> 01:56.580
适当的放在你装手套的盒子里的时候
and put it in the glove box of the reasonably priced minivan you got over there.

01:56.590 --> 01:57.520
我将会逮捕你
I will cuff you.

01:57.530 --> 02:02.270
然后当着众人的面把你带走
I will drag you out of here in front of everyone.

02:04.910 --> 02:08.460
你想怎样?
What do you need?

02:10.800 --> 02:12.820
美国需要的
What America needs

02:12.830 --> 02:15.530

02:15.540 --> 02:18.040
可持续发展的

02:18.050 --> 02:23.700
经济可靠的全新替代型燃料
and economically responsible alternative fuel source.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.630
请留言  我会尽快回电 谢谢
Leave a message and I'll call you back. Thanks.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.000
嗨  是温蒂
It's Wendy.

02:30.010 --> 02:32.950
知道你工作时不想分心 所以不用接了
 I know you wanted to work with no distractions, so don't pick up.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.960
我只想告诉你 尼克·萨维恩给你打了六个电话
I just wanted to let you know that Nick Savrinn left six messages for you...

02:36.970 --> 02:38.860
你都告诉她什么了?
What did you tell him?

02:38.870 --> 02:41.810
照你的吩咐  告诉他你在开会
What you said to say you were in a meeting.

02:41.820 --> 02:44.560
好的  如果明天他还来的话 告诉他我不在这里  好么?
Look,If he comes by tomorrow, tell him I'm not there.OK?

02:44.570 --> 02:46.220
好的  晚安维罗妮卡
OK. Goodnight, Veronica.

02:46.230 --> 02:49.060
多谢  温蒂
Thanks, Wendy.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.630
查宿
Bed check.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.550
能向我解释一下为什么不回我电话么?
Do you want to tell me why haven't you returned any of my calls?

05:25.560 --> 05:29.600
听着  我很感激你一直以来给予我的帮助?
Look, I really appreciate everything you've done,okay?

05:29.610 --> 05:31.500
但我从此不需要了
but I don't want your help anymore.

05:31.510 --> 05:33.470
不再需要我的帮助了
Don't want my help anymore.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.900
你还是以为那盘丢失的录像带和我有关?
Do you really think I had something to do with that missing tape?

05:35.910 --> 05:39.330
不  我只是想冲杯咖啡  然后继续工作好么?
No. I'm just gonna go grab a cup of coffee and get back to work.okay?

05:39.340 --> 05:43.030
我现在没时间来讨论这个
I don't have time for this right now.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.450
维罗妮卡
Veronica,

05:46.460 --> 05:48.110
请等一下
just wait a second.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.860
能不能听我说?
Will you hold on a second?

05:49.870 --> 05:52.580
-你为什么躲着我?  -不要碰我  好么?
-Listen, what are you avoid...  -Don't touch me!all right?

05:52.590 --> 05:55.080
没事吧 多诺万小姐?
Everything OK, Miss Donovan?

05:55.090 --> 05:59.300
卢卡斯  可否麻烦你送我回屋?
Lucasz, do you mind walking me back inside?

06:01.410 --> 06:03.620
走远点  伙计
Take a walk, pal.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.550
别痴心妄想了
You're being paranoid.

06:07.390 --> 06:11.410
-别痴心妄想了  -滚远点
-You're being paranoid.  -Go away, Nick.

06:23.410 --> 06:26.140
露点皮出来 斯科菲尔德
Show some skin, Scofield.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.180
斯科菲尔德
Hey, Scofield!

06:46.450 --> 06:49.570
刚睡着呢  老大
I'm trying to sleep, boss.

06:58.230 --> 07:00.720
到不了围墙
I can't get through the wall.

07:00.730 --> 07:02.810
什么意思  你到不了围墙?
What do you mean you can't get through the wall?

07:02.820 --> 07:04.700
我知道怎么做
I know how to do it.

07:04.710 --> 07:07.170
只是没有足够的时间
I just don't have the time to do it.

07:07.180 --> 07:09.950
咱们被关在这儿 有的是时间
We're locked up. All we got is time.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.290
你不明白
You don't understand.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.530
我本来已计划好了这一切
I planned this break on a schedule.

07:14.540 --> 07:16.140
但这里却总是点名
They constantly coming up here for count

07:16.150 --> 07:18.970
使我无法顺利完成墙那边的工作
won't let me do what I need to do to get through the wall.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.780
如果我不能按时回来
If I'm not back on schedule,

07:20.790 --> 07:24.590
就意味着即使几天后 咱们顺利穿过了那堵墙
which means we're through by the end of the day manana,

07:24.600 --> 07:27.450
也无法离开这里
we're not getting out of here.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.690
生活中有三个东西是无法逃避的
Look, there's three things for certain in life

07:29.700 --> 07:33.200
死亡  税收  还有点名
death, taxes and count.

07:33.290 --> 07:36.930
唯一逃避点名的办法就是
The only way to stop count is...

07:37.580 --> 07:39.170
是什么?
What?

07:39.180 --> 07:41.180
算了  这主意不好
Never mind. It's a bad idea.

07:41.190 --> 07:45.220
比失去玛丽克鲁兹还糟?
Worse than the idea of losing Maricruz?

07:49.710 --> 07:51.400
一级禁闭
A lockdown.

07:51.410 --> 07:54.730
只要能让这里禁闭一天 你就有足够的时间来做你想做的
 We get Gen Pop locked down for a day, you'll have all the time you need.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.200
-不用点名?  -那帮畜生甚至都不会来
-And no count?  -Bulls don't even come by.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.700
只是有一点
Only one problem.

08:00.710 --> 08:04.460
怎样才能让这里被禁闭呢?
How do we get a lockdown?

08:09.460 --> 08:11.630
你到得了空调机房么?
Can you get to the prison AC unit?

08:11.640 --> 08:14.140
或许
Maybe.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.650
想要被封闭 首先要激怒这里的囚犯
You want a lockdown? You got to get the inmates riled up.

08:18.660 --> 08:21.730
想再狠点的话
And if you wanna piss off the meat in concrete,

08:21.740 --> 08:25.570
再加点温
turn up the heat.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.650
还以为你退休了呢
I thought you were retired.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.250
不用管我
Never mind me.

09:27.260 --> 09:30.540
上面希望这事尽早解决 我也是迫不得已
Some heavy hitters want this done, so that means I want it done.

09:30.550 --> 09:32.210
不能有丝毫差错
No screw-ups.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.750
既然你开口  肯定没问题
For you, Diamond, it's not a problem.

09:34.760 --> 09:38.020
布伦斯死定了
Burrows is as good as dead.

09:47.830 --> 09:50.000
这个四月还真是热
Hottest April on record.

09:50.010 --> 09:53.270
-全球气候变暖   -或许吧  现在有时间么?
-Global warming.  -Probably. You got a minute?

09:53.280 --> 09:55.970
有差不多5年呢
About five years' worth.

09:55.980 --> 09:59.340
没错 
Sorry. Right.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.780
你从没和我说过林肯·布伦斯是你哥哥
You never told me Burrows is your brother.

10:01.790 --> 10:04.330
-你也没问过  -没错
-It never came up.  -Right.

10:04.340 --> 10:08.460
我很好奇 这事是否和我的那个州长父亲有关
I'm curious if that isn't because of my father, the governor.

10:09.630 --> 10:10.540
他说话可能不太管用
He may not be the one pulling the switch,

10:10.550 --> 10:13.840
你我都知道  他可以请求缓刑 但他是不会那样做的
but you and I both know he has power to grant clemency and he won't.

10:13.850 --> 10:17.140
永远都不会
and he never does.

10:17.150 --> 10:21.470
我家老头曾因酗酒成性将家人抛弃
My old man was an abusive drunk who abandoned his family.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.150
(所以)我从来不通过家长的举动看人
I don'tjudge anyone by their father's actions,or inactions,

10:25.160 --> 10:30.040
你是担心这个吗?
if that was your concern.

10:30.050 --> 10:35.670
正如你所知道的 我不太赞同他的某些政策
Just so you know,I don't agree with his politics.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.110
你哥哥的事我很抱歉
And I'm sorry about your brother.

10:39.120 --> 10:42.770
多谢了
I appreciate that.

10:51.230 --> 10:54.540
虽说帮不上太大的忙
Hey, this isn't much...

10:57.440 --> 10:59.850
我每周要为林肯做检查
I have to give Lincoln a weekly checkup now.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.750
如果愿意的话 我可以把他的检查时间安排在
If you want, I could schedule those visits

11:01.760 --> 11:04.790
在给你打针之前
to end right before you come in for your shots.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.670
这样或许
That way

11:07.680 --> 11:12.120
你们能互相见一面 虽然时间不长
you could at least see each other,even if it's just in passing.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.000
谢谢你了
Thank you.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.110
不客气
Yeah.

11:34.290 --> 11:38.310
来自厨师的问候  菜鸟 100块钱
Greetings from the kitchen, fish. 100 bucks.

11:45.240 --> 11:49.970
图多尔·伯格威尔 从医务室归来
Theodore Bagwell,transferred back from the infirmary.

12:02.550 --> 12:07.660
为你准备了一个"康复"礼物
We got you a little "get well" gift.

12:10.620 --> 12:14.350
大小正合适
It's just the right size.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.850
谢谢伙计们
Thank you, boys.

12:16.860 --> 12:19.840
回见
I'll catch up with you later.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.990
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.540
塞斯
Seth.

12:29.550 --> 12:32.230
新来的  塞斯?
You new, Seth?

12:32.240 --> 12:36.260
害怕么?  看着我 孩子
Scared? Look at me, boy.

12:41.070 --> 12:44.330
你应该听说过我的故事
You probably heard stories about me.

12:46.950 --> 12:50.350
不全是真的
They're not all true.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.270
我们出去走走好么?
What do you say we go for a walk, huh?

14:19.110 --> 14:20.760
您的助理已经到了
Your co-counsel's already here.

14:20.770 --> 14:22.980
你说什么?
Excuse me?

14:26.570 --> 14:28.220
你来这干什么?
What the hell are you doing here?

14:28.230 --> 14:29.980
和客户谈话
I'm talking to my client.

14:29.990 --> 14:31.750
-不要和他讲话  -维罗妮卡
-Don't talk to him.  -Veronica

14:31.760 --> 14:33.490
我们还不了解他
We don't know anything about this guy.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.800
他找到能帮助我们的办法了
He found somebody that could help us out.

14:36.990 --> 14:38.890
只给你1分钟
You have one minute.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.250
我看了谋杀当晚的报告
I've been going over the incident report from the night og the murder,

14:41.260 --> 14:43.950
有位匿名人士打电话给警察
and somebody made an anonymous phone call to the local cops

14:43.960 --> 14:46.620
宣称看见林肯从车库中跑出来
claiming to see Lincoln running away from the garage

14:46.630 --> 14:47.890
身穿血裤
 with bloody pants.

14:47.900 --> 14:48.890
这个我们以前讨论过
We've been through this

14:48.900 --> 14:51.220
听着  我们不能去盘问一个 我们根本不知道是谁的人
look, You can't cross-examine a witness if you don't know who it is.

14:51.220 --> 14:52.200
根本就不用知道他是谁
We don't need to know who it is

14:52.200 --> 14:53.640
我们知道他在哪儿
We know where he is.

14:53.650 --> 14:54.710
你的意思是?
What do you mean?

14:54.720 --> 14:55.790
虽然费了些时间
Well, it took some doing,

14:55.790 --> 14:59.790
一个私家侦探朋友帮我跟踪 到了那个打到警察局的电话
But a PI friend of mine backtracked the phone call back to the police department.

14:59.790 --> 15:00.540
不管是谁打的那个电话
Whoever made that call

15:00.540 --> 15:03.620
那晚他根本不可能看到林肯从车库中跑出来
couldn't have seen Lincoln rom the garage that night.

15:03.630 --> 15:05.730
何以见得?
How do you know?

15:05.740 --> 15:10.200
因为电话是从华盛顿打来的
Because the phone call came from Washington DC.

15:28.920 --> 15:33.560
我只是让你关掉空调 你狗日的把暖气也给打开了
You were supposed to turn off the AC,not turn on the furnace.

16:00.070 --> 16:01.300
这里还真是热啊
It's getting so hot in here.

16:01.310 --> 16:05.270
我没说过让你讲话吧 雏儿?
Did I say you could talk, Cherry?

16:06.190 --> 16:09.920
我让你开口的时候才能说话
You'll know when I want you to open your mouth.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.740
盖里!
Geary!

16:16.860 --> 16:18.440
这么热你总得做点什么吧?
You got to do something about the heat.

16:18.450 --> 16:20.530
-我们已经尽力了  -尽了力也还是废物
-Doing the best we can.  -Your best is garbage.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.140
这里都够100度了
It's 100 degrees in here.

16:22.150 --> 16:25.550
我看起来像很凉快么?
Look like I got frostbite to you?

16:25.560 --> 16:28.410
排好队!
Line up!

16:44.910 --> 16:47.840
为什么不把我们转到其他凉快的地方?
Why don't you transfer us all someplace cooler,

16:47.850 --> 16:50.820
非洲怎么样?
 like Africa?

16:51.710 --> 16:55.880
你给我站好队  臭犯人
Get your ass on the line, convict.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.520
全体人  都站到线上!
All of you, hit that line!

17:00.530 --> 17:06.970
这里的温度恢复正常了我们就回去  可以么?
We'll move when the temperature situation is rectified.all right?

17:08.760 --> 17:10.910
贝利克,我是牢区的马克
 Hey Bellick, this is Mack in cell block.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.360
这里有人要闹事
We got some cons popping off.

17:12.370 --> 17:14.600
先海扁他们一顿 然后仍到线后  再记下他们的名子
Give 'em a smack, throw 'em on the line and write 'em up.

17:14.610 --> 17:19.010
你要是连这个都办不了 这周就别想拿薪水了
If you can't handle it,don't cash your paycheck this week.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.830
恐怕现在不合适  医生
This is not a good time, Doc.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.210
我听说有犯人患了热衰竭
I got a call a prisoner was suffering from heat exhaustion

17:24.220 --> 17:27.110
-他胡说的  -这就是你的诊断么?
-He's faking it.  -Is that your medical opinion?

17:27.120 --> 17:30.750
A区热的让人有些神志不清了
We got a bunch of overheated cons getting loud in A-Wing.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.620
这不能怪他们  那里简直是个烤箱
I don't blame 'em. It's an oven in there

17:32.630 --> 17:33.840
这里一切正常
Everything's under control.

17:33.850 --> 17:36.210
但你必须立刻回到医务室
But you should go back to the infirmary building.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.730
等情况稳定下来
When things calm down,

17:37.740 --> 17:40.430
我会把病人送到你那里去的
 I'll have your patients transferred from Sick Bay.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.280
我这也是为你着想
I'm just looking out for your best interests.

17:42.290 --> 17:44.750
非常感谢
And I appreciate that.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.610
但是贝利克长官  你我都知道
But Officer Bellick, you and I both know that

17:46.620 --> 17:48.880
拒绝对犯人医治是犯法的
it's illegal to deny a prisoner medical care

17:48.890 --> 17:50.400
你也会因此丢掉饭碗的
and you could lose yourjob over it.

17:50.410 --> 17:53.810
我这也是在替你着想
and I'm just looking out for your best interests.

17:56.570 --> 17:59.870
请便吧
Go right on in.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.050
那就多谢了
Thank you, sir.

18:04.820 --> 18:06.890
T-bag 别像个孩子似的
Don't be a baby, T-Bag.

18:06.900 --> 18:09.460
没那么热
It ain't that hot.

18:09.470 --> 18:12.310
还不够热么?!
Not that hot?!

18:12.320 --> 18:17.990
这哥们早上起床时还是白人呢!
When this guy woke up this morning,he was white!

18:24.280 --> 18:27.250
你想凉快下来是么?
You wanna cool off?

18:28.540 --> 18:31.100
退后!
Step back.

18:34.560 --> 18:40.440
有冷风后我们自然会回去的
We'll step back when we get some wind blowing in here.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.180
好吧  你们自找的!一级禁闭!
All right! That's it! Lockdown!

18:46.190 --> 18:48.030
都回到牢房里去!
Everyone back to your cells!

18:48.040 --> 18:53.150
我让你们都回到牢房里  臭犯人!
I said everyone back to your cells.Now, convicts!

18:53.160 --> 18:55.680
一级禁闭!
Lockdown!

18:56.540 --> 18:58.430
你得到了你的禁闭  伙计
You got your lockdown.bro, Do your thing.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.890
-你也得一起来  -什么? 不  不  不
-You're coming with me.  － What? No, no, no, no.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.730
我只负责把风伙计  仅此而已
I'm the lookout, man, that's it.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.950
我需要你帮忙 这是俩人的活
I need you down there. It's a two-man job.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.080
把床单挂上
Let's hang a sheet.

19:07.090 --> 19:07.750
不 这不行  伙计
N-N-No way, man.

19:07.750 --> 19:11.060
难道不知道只有想和狱友亲热的时候才挂那个
You only hang a sheet when you and your cellie wanna get friendly.you know?

19:11.070 --> 19:12.680
你想保持在监狱里的声誉
You wanna protect your prison rep?

19:12.690 --> 19:16.000
还是想离开这儿?
Or you wanna get out of here?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.140
这里到底是怎么回事?
What the hell's going on in here?

20:20.150 --> 20:22.850
犯人异常兴奋  都不肯回去
Well, these inmates became belligerent and they refused to rack in.

20:22.860 --> 20:25.630
有的犯人还没回到牢房你就把门关上了是么?
You locked it down with inmates still out of their cells?

20:25.640 --> 20:30.270
20个总比300个人要好处理的多
We can handle 20 out-of-control inmates easier than 300.

20:32.280 --> 20:36.020
听着  伙计  贝利克  我有话要告诉你
Listen up, bros.Listen up. Bellick.I got one for you.

20:36.030 --> 20:39.100
你知道如何称呼一个无法通过警察考试的白种猪头
What do you call a piece of white trash who couldn't pass the cops exam

20:39.110 --> 20:41.610
而现在混的却连个邮差都不如的人么?
and now makes less than a mailman?

20:41.620 --> 20:44.790
狱警
A CO.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.450
把手从栅栏上拿开
Get your hands off the fence.

20:47.460 --> 20:48.630
去你的  猪!
Suck it, pig!

20:55.150 --> 20:58.190
特迪 你真的很我很失望 我实在不想说你
You know, Teddy, You really let me down.And that's hard to do,

20:58.200 --> 21:00.450
因为我的期望值不是很高
because I don't expect much

21:00.460 --> 21:05.390
尤其是对个天生的智障
from the inbred child of a retard.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.620
没错 特迪
That's right, Teddy.

21:09.630 --> 21:11.810
我看过你的病例
I read your psych records.

21:11.820 --> 21:15.760
某人的爸爸强奸了他的白痴妹妹
About how your daddy raped his mongoloid sister

21:15.770 --> 21:21.610
然而在9个月后小特迪破壳而出了
and then nine months later little Teddy pops out.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.810
老子宰了你
I'm gonna kill you!

21:35.580 --> 21:36.950
简直比地狱还热
Hot as hell.

21:36.960 --> 21:41.400
用不了多久他们就会吃不消的
They'll wear themselves out eventually.

21:44.690 --> 21:46.040
电话里说的是假的
The call was a fake.

21:46.050 --> 21:47.940
那能不能延缓我的死刑?
What about a stay of execution or...?

21:47.950 --> 21:49.450
不行  法律依据还不足
No no It's legally insufficient.

21:49.460 --> 21:52.410
这是什么意思
What the hell does that mean?

21:52.420 --> 21:53.870
这又是为什么?
What the hell does that mean?

21:53.880 --> 21:57.030
因为他们指出了你的罪证
It means the prosecution could point out the evidence from your criminal trial.okay?

21:57.040 --> 22:00.250
血样  录像  还有枪
The blood, the video, the gun.

22:00.260 --> 22:04.680
一个可疑的电话不足以否定那些的
A questionable phone call is not gonna stack up to that.

22:04.690 --> 22:07.620
-但的确能说明些问题  对么?  -是的
-But it's something, right?  -Absolutely.

22:07.630 --> 22:08.700
我们有区号
 We got an area code.

22:08.710 --> 22:11.440
我的人将会继续跟踪那个号码 这样就能确定具体的
and my contact is going to track that number to someplace more specific

22:11.450 --> 22:13.420
大楼  地区  或是街区
a building,a neighbourhood, a block

22:13.430 --> 22:15.350
然后找到打那个电话的人
to the person who made this call.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.640
然后呢?
OK. What happens next?

22:16.650 --> 22:19.470
我们必须马上去赶开往华盛顿的飞机
We need to catch the next flight to DC.

22:19.480 --> 22:23.990
前提是  你现在要相信我
That is, of course, if you trust me now.

22:25.530 --> 22:27.260
是时候了!
It's coming.

22:27.270 --> 22:30.160
时候到了! 时候到了!
It's coming! It's coming!

22:30.170 --> 22:32.900
来呀!
Get on the train! Whoo!

22:42.780 --> 22:45.220
来呀!

22:45.230 --> 22:47.250
来呀!
Get on the train!

22:47.260 --> 22:49.630
跟我回办公室
Let's get to my office.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.390
正如我所料
Oh, just what I thought.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.680
小猪怕大狼
The piglets are scared of the big bad wolf.

22:53.690 --> 22:56.500
大坏狼!
Big bad wolf!

22:57.770 --> 23:00.440
正如我所料
Oh, just what I thought.

23:00.450 --> 23:04.170
再加把劲儿
Get on the train!

23:15.750 --> 23:18.100
快走
Come on.

23:54.470 --> 23:57.200
玛丽莲 不!
Marilyn, no!

24:19.330 --> 24:21.440
这是谁的钥匙?
Whose keys are those?

24:21.450 --> 24:24.400
可能是暴动的时候
I guess in the commotion...

24:27.230 --> 24:32.120
你的子弹够干掉几个人?
How many rounds you think you're going to get off before they get their hands on you?

24:34.310 --> 24:35.910
我是贝利克
This is Bellick.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.100
我们的地区已经被突破
Our wing has been breached.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.280
请求关闭A区并撤退
I want A-Wing evacuated and shut down.

24:40.290 --> 24:43.650
同时关闭通往B区的入口
All access to B-Wing cut off now.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.100
为你输点液就会没事了  好么?
I'm gonna get some fluids into you,you'll be good as new.

24:54.110 --> 24:57.080
相信我的话就点点头
Nod your head if you believe me.

24:57.090 --> 24:59.850
好样的
Good man.

25:00.410 --> 25:02.040
西奥
Theo.

25:02.050 --> 25:04.850
今天能为你做些什么?
What can we do for you today?

25:07.650 --> 25:09.290
是这儿么?
Hmm. This where it hurts?

25:09.300 --> 25:11.070
左面再往上点
A little higher and to the left

25:11.080 --> 25:13.150
你刚做完手术三个礼拜
You're three weeks post-op.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.440
膝盖现在还是用一根棍和三颗钉子固定在一起
Your knee's held together by a rod and three screws.

25:15.450 --> 25:18.990
所以敏感是正常的 不必再用药了
I'm saying tenderness is normal. No more meds.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.560
酷密 你又怎么了?
OK. Kwame, why are you back?

25:22.570 --> 25:24.130
犯人已经突破了禁闭
Inmates in cell block have compromised

25:24.140 --> 25:26.840
并且突破了A区的警卫站
lockdown and breached A-Wing.

25:26.850 --> 25:28.380
A区将关闭
A-Wing is shutting down.

25:28.390 --> 25:31.960
人多力量大!
It's popping off up in G Pop!

25:48.690 --> 25:50.270
在墙那边的某处
Somewhere on the other side of this wall

25:50.280 --> 25:54.470
是通往旧排水系统的主管道
is the main drainage pipe to the prison's old sewer system.

25:56.670 --> 26:00.620
只要能穿过这面墙 就能进入到管子里
If we can get through this wall,we can get into the pipe.

26:01.350 --> 26:05.120
到了管子里  就能到医务室
we can get into the pipe,we can get into the infirmary.

26:06.990 --> 26:12.350
如果能到达医务室 咱们就可以离开这儿了
If we can get to the infirmary,then we can get out of here.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.110
抱歉  所有来访者都必须马上离开
Sorry, all visitors have to leave the facility

26:16.120 --> 26:18.050

牢区内发生了小骚动
There's a minor disturbance in cell block.

为安全起见  A区已经关闭
 A-Wing is being shut down for safety purposes.

26:25.370 --> 26:27.740
-他不会有事吧?  -你得走了
-Will he be OK?  -You have to leave now.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.490
去华盛顿  也只能这样了
Go to DC. It's all we've got.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.920
我会照顾迈克尔的  好么?
I'll take care of Michael. All right?

26:30.930 --> 26:34.090
-好的  -麻烦你了
-okay  -Please.

26:35.590 --> 26:36.800
不好意思打断你们
Sorry about cutting you short.

26:36.810 --> 26:39.950
鲍勃,和你说过多少次 道歉会使你看起来软弱
Bob, how many times have I told you not to apologize. It makes you look weak.

26:39.960 --> 26:40.840
现在情况如何?
Now What's going on?

26:40.850 --> 26:42.690
正如我所说  小骚动
Like I said,It's a minor disturbance.

26:42.700 --> 26:47.180
小骚动? 我弟弟也在里面 带我过去
Minor disturbance? My brother is in Gen Pop.Give it to me straight.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.270
一些混蛋弄坏了牢区门
Some clowns breached cell block.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.640
但他们哪儿也去不了
But they won't get anywhere.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.210
两头的门都被我们锁上了
We always have locked doors on either end.

26:52.220 --> 26:55.160
没有什么可担心的
There's nothing to worry about.

26:55.420 --> 26:58.390
婊子养的
Son of a bitch.

27:00.450 --> 27:04.480
A区的又一部分被突破
Additional sectors of A-Wing have been compromised.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.080
乖乖
I'll be damned!

27:23.090 --> 27:27.940
一个菜鸟狱警 圣诞节还没到呢
A rookie CO, and it ain't even Christmas!

27:27.950 --> 27:31.890
帮我把手铐打开
Take the cuffs off. Give me the key.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.770
到别的地方去 T-Bag
Get out of here, T-Bag.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.580
哦  我懂 是你先发现他的  谁发现是谁的?
Oh, I see. You found him first.Finders keepers.

27:39.590 --> 27:43.370
我也同意那样做  不过
You know, I respect that. I do.

27:43.380 --> 27:46.070
凡事好商量
But I think we can work something out.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.330
你想怎样?
What you got?

27:47.340 --> 27:51.430
我可以使你在地球上剩下的几周非常  非常的快活
Oh, I can make your last few weeks on Earth quite, quite enjoyable.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.740
给你些粉儿  或是
Get you some Demerol, some X.

27:53.750 --> 27:57.440
足够使你忘掉那个大电椅
You know, Make you forget about that big bad chair.

27:57.450 --> 27:59.770
不行
No deal.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.900
你得多学学谈判的艺术
You gotta learn that art of negotiating.

28:02.910 --> 28:08.120
首先: 明确自己的地位
Lesson one -bargaining position.

28:08.130 --> 28:11.050
你的地位刚好变了
Rules just changed.  Get the pig!

28:13.770 --> 28:16.570

-What are you doing?  -I gotta get out of here.

看看周围  你跑不掉的
Look around,You're not gonna make it.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.280
不会见血的 大水缸
No blood needs to spill, Sink.

28:21.290 --> 28:23.590
那还不走开
Then walk away.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.740
咱们都知道这是不可能的
We both know that ain't gonna happen.

28:25.750 --> 28:28.100
没错
Yeah?

28:44.370 --> 28:46.540
混凝土好厚啊
That's one big pile of concrete.

28:46.550 --> 28:49.730
你怎么知道管道在那儿
How do you know where the pipe is?

28:50.620 --> 28:53.210
我请来了帮手
We've got someone to show us where it is.

28:53.220 --> 28:56.750
真的? 是谁?
Oh, really? Who?

29:06.530 --> 29:07.890
感染的不太严重
infection's not so bad.

29:07.900 --> 29:10.250
但为了以防万一我还是要给你打针青霉素  好么?
but I'm going to give you a shot of penicillin just to make sure, okay?

29:10.260 --> 29:12.840
多谢了  医生
Thanks, Doc.

29:21.530 --> 29:24.170
这里是Rizzo 有人需要支援么  完毕
This is Rizzo.Does anyone need back up, over?

29:24.180 --> 29:26.850
不用了 A区已经撤离并关闭
Negative. A-Wing is evacuating and locked down.

29:26.860 --> 29:29.400
待在B区
Remain in B-Wing.

29:40.150 --> 29:42.840
你好啊  医生?
What's up, Doc?

30:01.000 --> 30:05.190
来吧  医生
Come on, Doc.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.670
你不要这样
You don't wanna do this.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.620
很抱歉  这条线遇到了技术故障
We're sorry. This line is experiencing technical difficulties.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.170
你有没有看过狩猎节目
You ever see one of them safari shows

30:35.180 --> 30:39.030
一群猎豹冲向一只羚羊
where a bunch of cheetahs jump up on an antelope?

30:39.030 --> 30:42.190
想想你是哪个?
Guess which one you are.

31:07.610 --> 31:10.890
难缠的小猩猩  对吧?
Tough little gorilla, ain't he?

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
虽然我一直相信恶魔具有某种邪恶的力量
I was raised to believe the devil's got some crazy power,

31:21.010 --> 31:24.020
但还是不会认为他能帮咱们把这堵墙推倒
but I don't think shining him on this wall is gonna bring it down.

31:24.030 --> 31:26.450
除非他再有个大锤
Not unless he's got a sledgehammer.

31:26.460 --> 31:29.620
没必要用大锤
We don't need a sledgehammer.

31:34.580 --> 31:37.770
我用这个能干个鸟?
What the hell am I supposed to do with this?

31:40.650 --> 31:42.290

31:42.300 --> 31:45.030

让狱警们去平息暴乱吧
Let the bulls worry about the noise.

32:07.380 --> 32:10.460
你应该知道怎么打通这面六英尺厚的混凝土墙
You worry about how you're gonna drill through a six-inch concrete wall

32:10.470 --> 32:12.450
竟然用这么一个捣蛋器
with what used to be an egg beater.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.180
只要几个小洞就行
We just need a few small holes.

32:14.190 --> 32:15.970
我们能从小洞中钻出去么?
How can we fit through small holes?

32:15.980 --> 32:18.080
听说过抗拉强度么?
Ever hear of tensile strength?

32:18.090 --> 32:20.230
胡克弹性定律?
Hooke's Law of elasticity?

32:20.240 --> 32:21.610
你是怎么想的?
 What do you think?

32:21.620 --> 32:23.380
我们只需在几个重点位置打好孔
If we drill holes in strategic locations,

32:23.390 --> 32:26.780
这样就破坏掉了墙的承载力
we compromise the load-carrying capacity of the wall.

32:26.790 --> 32:28.440
说点我听得懂的成么?
How about speaking English?

32:28.450 --> 32:31.470
我们就打通了盖住管道口的墙
We'll be able to break through the part of the wall that covers the pip

32:31.480 --> 32:33.700
把那个给我
Give me that.

32:33.710 --> 32:36.900
我们在每个角尖  眼睛
We go in through the tip of each horn,the eyes,

32:36.910 --> 32:38.070
鼻子末端
 the end of the nose,

32:38.080 --> 32:40.610
牙齿的尽头  头发的末端
the bottom of the fangs, and end of the braids.

32:40.620 --> 32:43.190
(连起来)就像是个"X"
It makes a kind of X.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.420
我们开始吧
Let's get to it.

32:54.890 --> 32:59.000
如果我们使用政府下发的新式武器
If I can get DIRT in there with some of the newer firepower...

32:59.010 --> 33:02.370
没错 我们今天就会结束暴乱 然后为他们再举行个葬礼了
Oh, yeah, so we can end the riots today and start funerals tomorrow?

33:02.380 --> 33:03.610
我可以控制住(局势)的
I can contain this.sir

33:03.620 --> 33:05.620
-有个电话找您  -现在不行
-Warden, I got a call for you.  -Not now.

33:05.630 --> 33:09.190
我想您还是接一下吧  是州长
I think you should take it. It's the governor.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.420
-长官  -我女儿在哪儿?
-Governor.  -Where's my daughter?

33:11.430 --> 33:12.600
不必担心  她很好
Not to worry, sir. She's fine.

33:12.610 --> 33:14.380
她在B区的医务室
She's in Sick Bay in B-Wing.

33:14.390 --> 33:16.400
和A区完全不同的一区
It's a completely different part of the facility,

33:16.410 --> 33:18.890
那里和骚动区完全隔离
It's, uh, totally locked off from the disturbance.

33:18.900 --> 33:21.050
骚动?  你就是这么称暴乱的么?
Disturbance? That's what you're calling a riot nowadays?

33:21.050 --> 33:23.440
那些畜生有没有可能接触到我女儿?
Can these animals get to her?

33:23.450 --> 33:27.490
先生  任何人都不可能从A区到达医务室的
Sir, it's impossible for anyone from A-Wing to get into Sick Bay.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.490
警卫已经确认一切正常
A guard there assures us that everything is fine.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.340
一切都在我们的控制中  长官
We have everything under control.Governor

33:31.350 --> 33:35.760
为了你自己  你最好那样
For your sake, you'd better hope you do.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.070
我要和你跳舞  医生!
I'm gonna dance with you, Doc!

33:49.320 --> 33:50.240
一直跳到天亮!
We are going to dance till the sun come up!

33:50.740 --> 33:53.240
过来  医生  把门打开
Come on, Doc!Open the door!

34:01.560 --> 34:03.150
换你来
All right. It's your turn.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.140
我不能惊动恶魔  伙计
No. I ain't messing with no diablo.

34:05.150 --> 34:06.870
我们不能停下来
man, We can't afford downtime.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.080
必须轮流钻
We have to switch off drilling.

34:08.090 --> 34:09.710
这可不是什么好兆头  伙计 你开玩笑呢?
It's bad mojo.bro Are you kidding me?

34:09.720 --> 34:11.210
我惊动了他  你在他上面钻孔
I mess with him,you drill into him,

34:11.220 --> 34:13.090
他就会被激怒  然后会怎样?
he gets pissed.and then what?

34:13.100 --> 34:16.680
我的敌人已经够多的了
I got enough enemies already, papi. OK?

34:16.690 --> 34:19.230
你信上帝  对么?
You believe in God, right?

34:19.240 --> 34:20.570
你知道我信
You know I do.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.930
所以你是受上帝保护的
So you're protected.

34:22.940 --> 34:27.220
他会保护你的
He'll protect you.From him.

35:00.560 --> 35:04.240
我向你们保证 一旦我和鲍勃无法达成一致...
I assure you, once Bob and I are don't getting acquainte...

35:04.250 --> 35:06.340
我们千刀万剐了他
We blaze him!

35:06.350 --> 35:09.790
谁都有机会
...everyone else will get their turn.

35:09.800 --> 35:15.440
好啊!
yeah

35:19.360 --> 35:21.460
咱们去玩点好玩的
We're gonna have a little fun, Bobby.

35:21.460 --> 35:23.600
不用担心
Don't worry.

35:23.610 --> 35:25.650
我不脏
I don't got the blickey.

35:25.660 --> 35:28.540
我的那儿很干净
My pipes are clean.

35:30.390 --> 35:33.600
你现在又想去哪儿  菜鸟?
Where are you going, rookie?

35:35.890 --> 35:39.990
不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.660
他们总认为自己能够跑掉
They always think they can run away.

36:00.160 --> 36:03.430
我有个问题想问你  菜鸟
Got a question for you, fish.

36:04.660 --> 36:07.840
咱们打通这堵墙后 却发现管道在十英尺外怎么办?
What if we do all this work and the pipe is ten feet that way?

36:07.850 --> 36:11.020
-不会的  -你会X光透视?
-It won't be.  -you got X-ray vision?

36:11.030 --> 36:13.030
我计算过钻孔点的坐标
I calculated the drill point coordinates,

36:13.040 --> 36:16.420
把他们标在我的纹身里 然后在把他们的位置还原到墙上
hid them in my tattoo and then projected them onto the wall.

36:16.430 --> 36:19.540
所有的点都经过计算 图像会表示出正确的位置
Everything's been worked out so the image hits the right spot.

36:19.550 --> 36:20.680
只不过是数学问题罢了
It's just math.

36:20.690 --> 36:23.440
你要是计算错了呢?
What if your math is wrong?

36:23.450 --> 36:26.540
你会钻到墙那边的某根煤气管道里
You'll drill into one of a dozen gas lines behind the wall.

36:26.550 --> 36:30.340
然后会爆炸  我们将活活的被烧死
There'll be an explosion and we'll be burned alive.

36:33.450 --> 36:36.920
你数学学的不错  对吧?
But you're good at math, right?

37:08.970 --> 37:11.800
他们想越狱
They're breaking out.

37:19.000 --> 37:25.960
-他们要  -嘘
-They're breaking...  -Shh.

37:49.280 --> 37:53.750
你来,你胳膊比我长
Yo, Stroke.You got longer arms than me, man.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.470
噢! 婊子
Agh! Son of a...

38:05.520 --> 38:08.440
那婊子戳我
That bitch stuck me.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.990
他们还不嫌热么?我要切断所有的水源
You think it's hot now?I want all the water shut off.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.270
-我去处理  -麦克尔 这事交给你了
-I'll call it in.  -Mack, you take care of it.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.690
遵命
Yes, sir.

38:42.730 --> 38:45.810
-我们现在遇到点问题   -噢 说的没错
-Yeah, we... we have a problem.   -That's right.

38:45.820 --> 38:49.610
鲍勃看到这个洞了 应该干掉他
Yeah, Bob here's seen the hole. He's gotta go away.

38:53.350 --> 38:56.820
-谁也不能死  -他看到洞了
-No one's going anywhere.  -He's seen the hole.

38:56.830 --> 38:59.730
你也看到了
So have you.

38:59.740 --> 39:03.350
看来戒严的主意还不够好  是吧?
Looks like your lockdown idea didn't work out too good, huh?

39:03.360 --> 39:07.070
我有个女儿  求你们了
I have a daughter. Please.

39:08.310 --> 39:09.670
我们得干掉他
We gotta kill him.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.640
警察就在外面
The cops are right outside.

39:12.740 --> 39:14.820
他们会一直守在那里
And they'll stay outside.

39:14.830 --> 39:17.000
只要他们知道我们还让他活着
As long as they know we're keeping him alive.

39:17.010 --> 39:18.040
他毕竟是个警卫
But he's a guard.

39:18.040 --> 39:19.430
他会出卖我们的
He's gonna squeal.

39:19.430 --> 39:23.370
他干什么关你卵事?
What the hell does this have to do with you anyway?

39:23.380 --> 39:27.680
这用不着你操心
This is not any of your concern.

39:31.280 --> 39:35.680
看  现在鲍勃知道了咱们的秘密
See, Bob here knows about our secret.

39:35.690 --> 39:40.100
他知道了咱们要越狱
He knows about our escape.

39:40.350 --> 39:44.960
所以这是事关大家的事  不是么?
So it's all of our concern now, isn't it?

40:01.130 --> 40:04.200
没事的  大块头  是我
Easy, big fella. It's just me.

40:04.210 --> 40:07.280
看来你伤得不轻啊
Looks like you took a pretty good hit.

40:09.990 --> 40:12.600
他们把警卫弄到牢房里了
Cons got that rook guard in Gen Pop.

40:12.610 --> 40:15.110
那孩子可能已经死了 宁愿他已经死了
Kid's probably dead already, or wishing he was.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.350
斯科菲尔德在哪儿?
Where's Scofield?

40:16.360 --> 40:18.030
自从开始闹事我就没见到他
Haven't seen him since things jumped off.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.050
我得去找他
I gotta find him.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.120
你在找斯科菲尔德?
You looking for Scofield?

40:21.130 --> 40:22.430
是的 
Yeah, Turk.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.730
跟我来
Come on.

40:34.070 --> 40:35.710
你差点坏了事  你这个疯子
You got things backwards, pervert.

40:35.720 --> 40:38.400
你的处境和他差不多了  明白么?
You're in as much trouble as he is. You understand?

40:38.410 --> 40:41.650
来啊   来啊  接着打  接着打
Go ahead. Go ahead. Stick me, stick me.

40:41.660 --> 40:43.750
看看在被你打死前
Let's see how many times I can shout out

40:43.750 --> 40:45.840
我能喊出多少声  比赛不?
about your little hole in there before I bleed out, huh?

40:45.850 --> 40:48.550
到时候你们的逃跑将变成众人皆知的秘密
'Cause every con in here is gonna know about your little escape

40:48.560 --> 40:51.810
在我第一滴血滴到地上前
before one drip of my blood hits the floor.

40:51.820 --> 40:53.950
不信你就试试吧  朋友
So you see, friends,

40:53.960 --> 40:55.760
要么咱们一起穿过那个洞
either I'm through that hole with you

40:55.770 --> 40:59.500
要么我像强尼·卡什一样歌唱(Johnny Cash－美国传奇乡村音乐人)
or I'm gonna sing like Johnny Cash.

41:25.130 --> 41:29.560
嘿  伙计 斯卓克就快抓住医生了!
Hey, yo! Check it!Stroke is about to get the doc.

41:43.860 --> 41:45.980
苏克雷  我需要你完成刚才的工作
Sucre, I need you to finish what we started.

41:45.990 --> 41:47.040
出什么事了  伙计? 你要去哪儿?
Where are you going,man?Where you going?

41:47.050 --> 41:48.000
医务室
Sick Bay.

41:48.010 --> 41:50.740
嘿  根本到不了B区 我们被堵死了
Hey There's no way to B-Wing. We're all locked out.

41:50.750 --> 41:54.310
我不这么认为  谁也不许动狱警
I'm not. No one touches the CO.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.600
谁也不行
No one.

42:03.390 --> 42:07.340
加我一个吧  老哥?
You gonna clue me in, paisano?

42:10.920 --> 42:14.190
从这边走能快点
It's faster if we cut through here.

42:14.910 --> 42:18.700
布伦斯死定了
Burrows is as good as dead.
