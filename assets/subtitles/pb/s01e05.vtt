00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
■

00:09.000 --> 00:10.890
放下武器
Put down your weapon.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.710
我有充分证据来判你有罪
I find it incumbent you see the inside of a cell.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.950
我正在找人  那家伙叫 林肯·布伦斯
I'm looking for someone, guy named Lincoln Burrows.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.580
那家伙杀了副总统的兄弟
Man killed the VP's brother.

00:17.590 --> 00:19.280
为什么你这么着急想见布伦斯
Why you want to see Burrows so bad, anyhow?

00:19.290 --> 00:20.310
因为他是我哥哥
He's my brother.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.620
-我正想法把你弄出去  -这不可能
-I'm getting you out.  -It's impossible.

00:22.630 --> 00:24.780
如果我是这里的设计人 就有可能
Not if you designed the place,it isn't.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.190
-你看过这儿的设计图纸了   -不仅如此
-You've seen the blueprints.  -Better than that.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.000
我把它纹在身上了
I've got'em on me.

00:29.010 --> 00:30.520
你查到是谁想害他么
You find out who's trying to bury him.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.210
-没人想害他  -那证据是伪造的
-Nobody's trying to bury him.  -The evidence was cooked.

00:33.220 --> 00:34.730
有个律师在多管闲事
There's a lawyer poking around.

00:34.740 --> 00:39.400
对任何危害到我们的人都是可以消失的
Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

00:39.730 --> 00:40.860
我要杀了那人渣
I'm gonna kill that scum.

00:40.870 --> 00:44.090
不能那样  如果你杀了他 你就毁了大家逃出去的希望
You won't. You kill him, you kill our express ticket out of here.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.350
你来这儿干吗  玛丽克鲁兹 呢
you doing here? Where's Maricruz?

00:45.360 --> 00:46.710
她现在和我在一起
She's with me now.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.540
听着  我必须回那儿去
Fish, I gotta be back in.

00:48.550 --> 00:50.230
尼克·萨维恩 的那个司法案子
Nick Savrinn with Project Justice.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.840
我的老板认为林肯的案子 已经没有再跟进的必要了
My boss may not think Lincoln's case is worth looking into,

00:52.850 --> 00:54.730
但我可不这么想
but I do.

00:54.740 --> 00:55.750
我们什么时候动手
When do we get started?

00:55.760 --> 00:57.830
打穿这堵墙只是第一步
Getting through this wall is just the beginning.

00:57.840 --> 01:01.370
这堵墙和外面还隔着好多呢
There's a whole lot of real estate in between here and the outside walls.

01:01.380 --> 01:03.290
这是份移送的文件
That is a transfer request.

01:03.300 --> 01:08.480
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德明早会被转到其他监狱去了
Michael Scofield is getting shipped out tomorrow.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.740
我想你们是为 迈克尔·斯科菲尔德 的那份移交申请来的吧
I assume this is about your transfer request for Michael Scofield.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.510
更确切地说 为什么你拒绝
More specifically, why you denied it.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.500
听着  克勒曼先生 我可没跑到你家
Look, Mr Kellerman, do I come to your house

01:46.510 --> 01:49.410
然后对你家里家具摆设指手画脚
and tell you where to put your furniture?

01:49.420 --> 01:51.810
我们只是帮你一个小忙而已
We're just asking for professional courtesy.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.610
我这个小小的州监狱可承受不了 你们联邦政府的好意
But you're asking for a federal courtesy in a state penitentiary.

01:54.620 --> 01:56.330
多数在你位置上的人
Most people on your position would be happy

01:56.340 --> 01:58.350
都会很乐意这件事让别人接手的
to have a body taken off their hands.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.060
惩罚那些人是我的责任
These men are my responsibility.

02:00.070 --> 02:01.910
从他们踏进那儿起
From the minute they walk through those walls

02:01.920 --> 02:04.090
直到他们还清了社会责任为止
to the time they've paid their debt to society,

02:04.100 --> 02:05.650
我都会对他们负责
I'm responsible for them.

02:05.660 --> 02:08.720
也就是说除非 斯科菲尔德 他做了什么我还不知道的事
Which means that unless he's done something I don't know about,

02:08.730 --> 02:12.350
他就将一直在我的监管下待在这儿
he is gonna stay here at Fox River under my watch.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.250
普柏 先生 在我们的调查中
Mr Pope, in our line of work,

02:14.260 --> 02:20.710
刚好发现一些其他人还不知道的事
we've discovered that just about everyone has done something that someone doesn't know about.

02:20.940 --> 02:21.670
这是什么
What's this?

02:21.680 --> 02:23.810
目前看 还只是一段过去的事情而已
Right now, just a piece of history.

02:23.820 --> 02:29.430
至于是不是将会变成现在时 就看你怎么做了
Whether it becomes a current event,now, that's up to you.

02:32.190 --> 02:35.230
我妻子已经知道 托雷多 的事了
My wife already knows about Toledo.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.840
是么
Does she really?

02:43.580 --> 02:45.810
你是个聪明人  监狱长先生
You're a smart man, Warden.

02:45.820 --> 02:46.980
我相信如果你仔细看
I'm sure if you look hard enough,

02:46.990 --> 02:50.080
你肯定能找到一个原因来解释
you could find a reason why Michael Scofield's presence is no longer required

02:50.090 --> 02:54.930
为什么 迈克尔·斯科菲尔德 不再需要呆在这儿了
at this particular correctional facility.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.990
这儿需要更多的管子  长官
I need some more PVC here, boss.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.220
-长官  -这个很常见 布伦斯
-Boss?  -Sure thing, Burrows.

03:23.230 --> 03:25.780
但  听着  我可不想挨个找碎片去
But, hey, I don't wanna check for splinters.

03:25.790 --> 03:29.360
-我希望每一片都有去处   -当然
-I want every piece accounted for.  -Sure.

03:29.370 --> 03:34.570
我发现里面有袋撕破了的化肥
I got a ripped fertilizer bag inside.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.460
嘿  你
Hey, you!

03:36.470 --> 03:38.710
就是你
You!

03:38.720 --> 03:40.190
去把里面清理干净
Get in there and clean it up

03:40.200 --> 03:45.750
否则里面太难闻了
before this whole place starts smelling like San Juan.

03:46.930 --> 03:48.170
嘿  他正朝这儿走来
OK, he's on his way.

03:48.180 --> 03:53.090
能告诉我究竟发生什么了吗
Do you mind telling me what this is all about?

03:54.890 --> 03:58.010
这些就都是要越狱的
These are the guys we're breaking out with.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.950
我可不这么想  小子
I don't think so, fish.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.810
之前我们可不是这么说的
That was not our agreement.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.750
我可不想和这些
I'm not gonna work with this

04:04.760 --> 04:07.050
-和这些疯子一起  -你再说阿
-crazy rhino.  -Keep pushing it, John.

04:07.060 --> 04:09.770
是的 我就要说
Yeah, I keep pushing it, you know. Huh?

04:09.780 --> 04:11.870
那你能做些什么
What's your deal, man?

04:11.880 --> 04:16.690
再动我的兄弟试试  我就会让你知道
Touch my brother again and I'll show you.

04:18.470 --> 04:23.870
兄弟  你的兄弟
Brother? Your brother?

04:25.450 --> 04:27.400
我们只有几分钟的时间
We've only got a few minutes.

04:27.410 --> 04:28.770
我们是用它来互相扯皮
We're gonna spend them spitting on each other,

04:28.780 --> 04:31.310
还是一起谈点正事儿
or are we gonna talk some business?

04:31.320 --> 04:34.480
我们现在必须作出一个决定
The reason we're all here today is we have a decision to make.

04:34.490 --> 04:37.590
英格力士  费兹  还是博西
English, Fitz, or Percy.

04:37.600 --> 04:38.990
如果我们想成功越狱
If we're gonna pull this off,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.600
我们就得在这几个中选一个
we need to take one of them out.

04:42.610 --> 04:45.420
你想让我们告诉你选哪个么
And you want us to tell you which one?

04:45.430 --> 04:47.980
我只是想让你们帮我想清楚
I just want you to help me get to them.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.090
-我会作出判断  -你疯了 你知道吗
-I'll take it from there.  -You're crazy.

04:50.100 --> 04:53.090
-我只需要五分钟   -你连五秒钟都没有
-All I need is five minutes. -You won't get five seconds.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.150
我以为你什么都搞定了
I thought you had everything worked out.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.110
我们不是要逃出一家连锁店而已 先生们
We're not breaking out of a Jamba Juice.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.030
不仅仅需要挖几个洞
It's gonna take more than digging a few holes.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.520
这里有这么多耳目监视
There are eyes, ears,

05:01.530 --> 05:04.390
根本不可能与外面联系
dots that couldn't be connected from the outside.

05:04.400 --> 05:10.410
-那英格力士  费兹  博西   -正是计划的一部分
-And English, Fitz or Percy?  -One of those dots.

05:10.420 --> 05:14.870
那你究竟想怎么搞定这些事
And how exactly are you supposed to pull this off?

05:14.880 --> 05:19.440
我的朋友会帮助我的
With a little help from my friends.

05:34.510 --> 05:36.010
苏克雷  等一下
Sucre, hold up.

05:36.020 --> 05:40.210
斯科菲尔德  有人要见你
Scofield, you've got company.

05:47.740 --> 05:54.150
为什么我总觉得你有事瞒着我呢   斯科菲尔德
Why do I get the feeling that there's more to you than meets the eye, Scofield?

05:54.160 --> 05:58.960
有什么事想说的吗
Anything you wanna tell me?

05:59.000 --> 06:05.760
你进来的原因  除了抢银行之外
Some other reason you're in here besides holding up a bank?

06:14.880 --> 06:17.980
-你会被转走  -什么
-You're being transferred.  -What?

06:17.990 --> 06:20.760
你会被转移到 斯特斯维尔
We're moving you over to Statesville.

06:20.770 --> 06:22.760
-你不能这么做  -不 我能
-You can't do that.  -Yes, I can.

06:22.770 --> 06:27.270
我是这儿的头 这儿我说了算
I'm the boss here.This is my house.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.450
-我要三个星期的时间  -什么
-Three weeks.  -What for?

06:29.460 --> 06:31.450
林肯·布伦斯
Lincoln Burrows.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.970
三周后他将被处决
He's being executed in three weeks.

06:33.980 --> 06:36.900
恩  这个我知道 可这儿和你有什么关系
I'm aware of that. What's that to you?

06:36.910 --> 06:40.500
他是我哥哥
He's my brother.

06:40.510 --> 06:42.310
当我知道我要被判刑
When I knew I was being sent to prison,

06:42.320 --> 06:45.050
我的律师就请求监狱总局
my attorney petitioned the DOC.

06:45.060 --> 06:49.830
-这样你就能和他在一起了  -没错
-So you could be near him.  -That's right.

06:50.550 --> 06:53.830
别把我转走
Don't take that away from me.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.790
至少在这一切都结束前
Not until it's over.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.700
不是我想转走你的
I'm not the one behind the transfer.

06:59.710 --> 07:04.780
你的对头是比我还要高的人物
You're up against much bigger fish than me.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.150
我会安排你们互相再见的
I'll arrange for you to say goodbye.

07:08.160 --> 07:12.500
明天就走吧
You ship out tomorrow.

08:36.300 --> 08:39.300
我打算今晚动手  看看是否能到屋顶
I'm going into the walls,see if I can access the roof.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.080
不想说说转监狱的事么
You going to tell me about the transfer?

08:42.090 --> 08:45.640
-我会处理的  -你会处理
-I'm taking care of it.  -You're taking care of it?

08:45.650 --> 08:48.120
听起来你已经搞定了
Sounds to me like you're reaching.

08:48.130 --> 08:51.150
也许  有些进展
Maybe. A little.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.390
有些进展
A little.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.520
你知道嘛   本来我已经准备接受这一切了
You know, I had made my peace to what was coming.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.200
但你出现了 给了我一样东西
and then you show up and give me the one thing

08:57.210 --> 09:00.090
是我这种人不应该有的东西
a man in my situation shouldn't have.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.460
希望
Hope.

09:01.470 --> 09:02.700
但似乎又要被夺走了
And now that's gonna be taken away.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.320
-别这么想  林肯  -我只有三周的时间了
-Don't do this, Linc.  -I got three weeks.

09:05.330 --> 09:09.880
你想让我怎么样
What do you want me to do?

09:13.360 --> 09:14.640
说阿 迈克尔
Come on, Michael.

09:14.650 --> 09:18.280
你到底想让我做什么
What do you want me to do?

09:18.290 --> 09:20.130
带她回来
Bring her back.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.500
你知道我做不到
You know I can't do that.

09:22.510 --> 09:26.210
听着  有些事情我的确可以做
But, look, there's some stuff that I can do.

09:26.220 --> 09:29.600
虽然一切都不一样了 不过我们会想办法的
It's not gonna be the same,but we're gonna figure it out.

09:29.610 --> 09:34.700
而且  不管发生什么 我们永远在一起
And no matter what,it's still gonna be me and you.

09:34.710 --> 09:39.250
好吧  但如果你出事儿了怎么办
OK, but what if something happens to you?

09:39.260 --> 09:44.610
你只要 相信我就可以了
You just have a little faith.

09:49.850 --> 09:53.710
相信我就可以了
Just have a little faith.

09:55.950 --> 09:57.280
好吧  就算这样
All right, here's the deal.

09:57.290 --> 09:59.080
我们相信林肯 这录影带是伪造的
We believe Lincoln,this tape is a lie.

09:59.090 --> 10:01.960
-肯定是的  -你都看到了  都在这儿了
-It has to be.  -you saw it. It's all there.

10:01.970 --> 10:06.380
恩  也许我们要找的不是这个
Yeah, but, but maybe what we're looking for is what's not there.

10:06.390 --> 10:08.730
好吧  斯蒂德曼
OK. Steadman.

10:08.740 --> 10:12.010
-你瞧 他在看什么  -车 还是什么人
You see, what's he looking at?  -car? A pedestrian?

10:12.020 --> 10:13.630
不  不  不 你看他的视线太高了  不是吗
No,No,No. His eye line is too high, right?

10:13.640 --> 10:15.520
看起来他更像是在看摄像头
It's like he's looking right into the camera.

10:15.530 --> 10:19.470
可能还在说 茄子
Might as well be saying "cheese."

10:19.500 --> 10:21.030
可现在他就坐那儿而已
Now he just sits there.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.330
像这样待了十  十五秒左右  看起来他在...
Like,10, 15 seconds, as if he was...

10:23.340 --> 10:24.340
等人
Waiting for someone.

10:24.340 --> 10:27.050
这里
There.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.940
那可是一把九毫米口径的手枪
That's a nine millimetre.

10:28.950 --> 10:30.710
难道不该有点后坐力什么的吗
Shouldn't there be some kind of kick or something?

10:30.720 --> 10:31.550
林肯身体很壮实
Lincoln's pretty strong.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.740
难道壮到可以消除任何后坐力么
Yeah, but strong enough to bury a recoil?

10:34.750 --> 10:36.960
假设  你杀了人
Now, you shoot someone,

10:36.970 --> 10:38.610
如果光为了复仇
supposedly for revenge.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.880
你还会花时间返回来
do you take the time to go back in

10:40.890 --> 10:42.710
翻箱倒柜的  还不赶紧离开吗
and hit the glove box? Or get the hell out of there?

10:42.720 --> 10:47.470
他们说他想造成一个抢劫的假象
Feds said he was trying to make it look like a robbery.

10:47.660 --> 10:48.840
看着
Look.

10:48.850 --> 10:53.050
看到林肯离开摄像头的角度没有
Look at Lincoln's angle as he leaves the frame.

10:53.060 --> 10:55.830
远离车的方向走去的
walks away from the car.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.440
但现在这家伙
Now, this guy,

10:57.450 --> 10:59.860
故意没有让自己的脸被摄像头捕捉到
who conveniently hides his face from the camera

10:59.870 --> 11:01.420
那他为什么还要返回呢  为什么
he comes back in. Why?

11:01.430 --> 11:04.500
正好能解释在他公寓里发现的 那条带血的裤子
To explain the bloody pants they'd already planted in his apartment.

11:04.510 --> 11:07.540
-尼克 这太棒了  -恩
-Nick, this is great.  -Yeah

11:07.550 --> 11:10.060
-我们该去找谁  -现在谁都不找  
-Who shall we go to?  -Nobody.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.470
我是说  从公正的角度看
Yet,I mean,to the unbiased eye,

11:11.480 --> 11:13.210
我们正从死神边缘抢夺时间
we're just backing a horse that died in the gate.

11:13.220 --> 11:14.870
有很多不确定的因素  你知道的
A lot of "what ifs" and conjecture, you know.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.650
我们什么都没有 我们需要证据
We don't have anything. We need some evidence.

11:17.660 --> 11:20.280
瞧  如果  林肯没开那枪
Look, if Lincoln didn't fire this gun,

11:20.290 --> 11:21.680
那一定有个非常专业的人
then somebody with some serious skills went to

11:21.690 --> 11:23.620
伪造了这盘带子来证明他开了那枪
work on this to prove he did.

11:23.630 --> 11:27.290
恩  那我们怎么证明呢
Fine, but how do we prove that?

11:27.300 --> 11:29.150
我认识一个人
I know a guy.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.830
-你认识一个人   -是的  我知道
-You know a guy?  -Yeah, I know a guy.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.970
谢谢
Thanks.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.120
看来我们得再做次讨论
Seems we need to have another powwow.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.350
听说你正在整理你的行李
There's been talk about you packing your bags.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.190
别听信谣言
Don't believe everything you hear.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.720
我哪儿都不会去
I'm not going anywhere.

11:46.590 --> 11:49.720
你知道  我真的很难相信你
You know, I have a really hard time trusting you, fish.

11:49.730 --> 11:52.920
重要的是我们仍然按计划进行着
The important thing is that we stay on schedule.

11:52.930 --> 11:56.240
-英格力士 费兹 或者 博西   -英格力士 费兹 或者 博西
-And English, Fitz and Percy?  -English, Fitz or Percy.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.830
你想知道我会怎么选么
You want to know which one we should take out?

11:58.840 --> 12:01.250
没别的意思 不过我不需要你的建议
all due respect, I don't need opinions.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.790
我得知道答案
I need answers.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.600
记住  监狱长晚上五点离开
Remember, The warden leaves at five tonight,

12:04.610 --> 12:06.790
所以五点零五分之前 我们得拿到钥匙
so by five past five we're going to need that key.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.940
有了钥匙 你怎么能得到答案呢
And how is this key gonna give you the answers?

12:09.950 --> 12:11.520
我会考虑这个问题的
I'll worry about that.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.900
你的问题是拿到钥匙
You,Worry about getting the key.

12:13.910 --> 12:20.740
这把钥匙最好能有所值  明白吗
This key better be worth it. Understand?

12:25.120 --> 12:28.190
下午好  斯科菲尔德 先生
Afternoon, Mr Scofield.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.380
我想知道怎么才能不被转移
I need to know if there's any way to block a transfer order.

12:31.390 --> 12:33.710
-至少有五十种方法  -那好
-There's about 50 ways.  -All right.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.470
我要那种最快的
I'll take the quickest.

12:35.480 --> 12:39.940
你写份申请来获取所谓的 临时禁令
You file a motion for what they call an "interlocutory injunction."

12:39.950 --> 12:42.670
-这需要多久   -你能多快写完
-How long does that take?  -How fast can you write?

12:42.680 --> 12:46.820
人们可以声称任何东西都有 可能损害到他们的合法权益
A man can claim almost anything violates his constitutional rights.

12:46.830 --> 12:49.570
像环境问题  过敏反应
There's environmental issues, allergies,

12:49.580 --> 12:51.630
宗教需要等  你可以选个适合你自己的
religious requirements, take your pick.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.250
-如果他们不接受怎么办   -没关系
-What if they don't buy it?  -Don't matter.

12:53.260 --> 12:55.340
法律规定 法院必须接收你的申请
Court's required by law to hear your motion

12:55.350 --> 12:57.830
那样在他们受理之前 你就不允许被转移
Until they do, you can't be transferred.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.330
那帮该死的想把我这把老骨头转走 已经动了十年的心思了
Hell, they've been trying to move my tired, grey behind for ten years.

13:02.330 --> 13:06.100
上帝保佑美国的司法系统
God bless the American legal system.

13:06.110 --> 13:08.940
为什么你那么想留在这儿呢
Why do you want to stay in here so badly?

13:08.950 --> 13:12.860
这儿有我不能丢下的东西
someone here I can't bear to leave behind.

13:12.870 --> 13:17.360
我想我们在某种程度上是一致的
I guess that means we've got something in common.

13:17.370 --> 13:20.010
政府要给 林肯·布伦斯 做次体检
State's requiring a physical for Burrows.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.770
-你听说了吧   -谢谢
-You heard the news? didn't you?  -Thanks.

13:21.780 --> 13:23.170
听说什么
No, what?

13:23.180 --> 13:24.720
-他们是兄弟  -谁
-They're brothers.  -Who?

13:24.730 --> 13:27.100
布伦斯和斯科菲尔德
Burrows and Scofield.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.620
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield?

13:28.630 --> 13:30.940
从监狱长那儿的狱警那里听到的
Heard it from one of the COs over in Gen Pop.

13:30.950 --> 13:32.680
他没跟你提起这事儿么
He didn't say anything to you about it?

13:32.690 --> 13:33.680
没有
No.

13:33.690 --> 13:36.680
恩  离自己的哥哥这么近
Oh. Must be hard to be here so close to your brother

13:36.690 --> 13:41.740
却对此无能为力 他一定很痛苦
and not be able to do anything to help him.

13:47.290 --> 13:49.590
-这是什么东西   -一些厕所读物
-What's this?  -More bathroom reading.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.780
-又是 韦斯特莫兰德 写的   -斯科菲尔德
Westmoreland again?  -Scofield.

13:51.790 --> 13:55.350
他好像不想被转走
He's blocking his transfer.

13:57.280 --> 14:01.360
即便申请被拒绝 至少也得花三十天处理
Even if the motion is denied,it's gonna take 30 days to process.

14:01.370 --> 14:05.280
也就是说
And that means...

14:05.360 --> 14:07.170
好了  我得进去了
All right, I'm going in.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.020
-我需要你的帮助  -你是指在墙里面
-I'm gonna need your help.  -You mean In ?

14:10.030 --> 14:11.430
就现在   我想你该等等
Now? I thought you were waiting till...

14:11.440 --> 14:13.520
我必须确认一下 我怎么才能上到那儿
I need to make sure I know how I'm getting up there

14:13.530 --> 14:15.790
那么到时候 
so when the time comes...

14:15.800 --> 14:18.710
好像你没注意到 所有的灯都亮着
In case you didn't notice, the lights are all on.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.520
我们会被很多人看到的
You've got a live studio audience, fish.

14:20.530 --> 14:23.260
你想搞得众人皆知么
How are you gonna get around that?

14:23.270 --> 14:27.750
我们不是还有衣服要洗吗
Don't we have some laundry to do?

14:30.640 --> 14:32.960
事先声明
Just to be clear,

14:32.970 --> 14:37.220
我可不高兴碰你的内裤
I ain't touching your drawers.

14:45.810 --> 14:48.930
眼睛朝前看
Eyes straight ahead.

14:48.940 --> 14:51.130
别停下
Keep it moving.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.400
别停下  继续走
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

15:14.470 --> 15:20.820
抓住他   抓住他
Get him up. Hit him.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.540
嫩鸡
Fish.

16:29.550 --> 16:33.340
我可应付不过来
I can't deal with that.

17:11.300 --> 17:15.600
嫩鸡 赶快啊
Fish. Come on.

17:28.700 --> 17:29.970
嘿 嫩鸡
Yo, fish.

17:29.980 --> 17:34.360
嫩鸡  你去的时间太长了
Fish, you're taking too long, bro.

17:59.420 --> 18:00.770
这可不行  伙计
This ain't gonna fly.man.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.730
作为波多黎各人
The Ricans,

18:01.740 --> 18:04.230
我们天生就有高血压的  你知道不
we've got genetically higher blood pressure, you know that?

18:04.240 --> 18:06.800
我堂兄  就是因为压力过大才死的
My cousin, he died from too much stress.

18:06.810 --> 18:09.400
好像你说过 是你的堂兄抢了你女朋友吧
Thought you said your cousin was moving in on your girl.

18:09.410 --> 18:12.500
那是另外一个 不过还真谢你的提醒呢  混蛋
That's my other cousin, but thanks for bringing that up, jackass.

18:12.510 --> 18:17.530
听着  有好消息 我知道怎么到屋顶了
Look, the good news is I can get to the roof.

18:17.540 --> 18:24.210
-那现在怎么办呢   -现在 就等合适的时机了
-So what happens now?  -Now?It's all about timing.

18:57.650 --> 18:59.470
这可是高技术含量的东西  你知道会是谁做的吗
This is a top-dollar job.Do you know who did it?

18:59.480 --> 19:01.160
不知道 你呢
No. Do you?

19:01.170 --> 19:04.450
能够做出这种活儿的都是魔鬼了  伙计
People who do this kind of work are ghosts, man.

19:04.460 --> 19:06.390
高手背后的高手阿
The guy behind the guy behind the guy,

19:06.400 --> 19:08.290
-你知道我的意思么   -你发现什么吗
-you know what I mean?  -You see anything?

19:08.300 --> 19:11.400
被剪辑过的痕迹 证明这是被伪造的
Definitive cuts? Any place that proves the tape might've been doctored?

19:11.410 --> 19:13.530
做的很漂亮 没有任何痕迹
The thing's clean. No footprints.

19:13.540 --> 19:16.090
我是说  通常  如果你把片子分成几层的话
I mean, usually, you peel a video back a couple of layers

19:16.100 --> 19:19.170
伪造的痕迹就显露出来了  但现在什么你们瞧  都看不出来
and anything bogus comes off.  Now you see it, now you don't.

19:19.180 --> 19:20.260
但这盘带子不同
But not this one.

19:20.270 --> 19:25.280
肯定是处理过的 但很巧妙
It's laced. Ingrained.

19:26.390 --> 19:27.700
-你发现什么了   -没
-You see something?  -No

19:27.710 --> 19:30.380
问题就处在你们的眼睛上 他们正是利用这个欺骗了你
The problem with eyes is they play tricks on you..

19:30.390 --> 19:33.200
但是你的耳朵  它不会欺骗你
But your ears...ears don't lie.

19:33.210 --> 19:36.770
瞧  这是从带子分离出来的音频
Here's the audio track from the tape.

19:36.780 --> 19:38.850
-听起来跟真的一样  是吧   -恩
-Sounds pretty true?  -Yeah.

19:38.860 --> 19:42.340
不过声音是假的 声音不应该这样消失的
But noise is a lie .See, it doesn't just die like that.

19:42.350 --> 19:45.470
应该是逐渐消失 所以声音应该是跳跃性的
Stripped down,those levels should be dancing.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.880
我的意思是 在那种地方的枪声
I  mean, a room that size would give you a..

19:47.890 --> 19:50.010
应该是一种   砰 砰 砰 砰
a... blam, blam, blam, blam. You know?

19:50.010 --> 19:53.030
明白吗    声波应该是逐渐从每个墙上消失
Like, one off each wall, split second after the other.

19:53.040 --> 19:56.250
而你们给的带子上 回声是同时响起的
On yours,the reverb's bouncing at the same time.

19:56.260 --> 20:00.010
-这到底是什么意思   -枪声的声波
-What does that mean?  -The sound of a gunshot.

20:00.020 --> 20:04.410
并不是从案发现场录的
It wasn't recorded in that room.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.990
你能确信么
Would you testify to that?

20:08.000 --> 20:11.040
恩  我   不知道 毕竟你们给我的是录制的
Oh, uh, I don't know. The tape's a dupe.

20:11.050 --> 20:13.470
你知道  据我所知 你们都动过带子
You know, for all I know, you guys tampered with it.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.680
听着  如果想让我到法庭作证
Look, you want me to testify in court,

20:15.690 --> 20:20.270
我要得到原始带子才行
I'm gonna need to get my hands on the original.

20:22.130 --> 20:25.510
-过敏反应怎么样了  -你说什么
-How are those allergies?  -Excuse me?

20:25.520 --> 20:28.480
在你的报告里  你提到了  嗯
In your motion, you cited chronic...

20:28.490 --> 20:30.540
鼻窦炎
Sinusitis.

20:30.550 --> 20:34.440
可这并不属于过敏 事实上  只是一种细菌感染
It's not an allergy, actually.It's a bacterial infection.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.840
从东墙河边飘来的空气
The moist air from the river along the east wall

20:36.850 --> 20:39.330
让我感觉  你知道的
helps keep me, you know...

20:39.340 --> 20:41.210
很好
clear.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.450
我很惊讶
I'm impressed.

20:42.460 --> 20:45.210
你到这儿还不到一周 就变得如此圆滑
Not even a week here and you're working it like an old con.

20:45.220 --> 20:47.190
哦  这方面你比我厉害多了 监狱长大人
Well, you've got one up on me, Warden.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.190
你知道我为什么要写那份申请
You know why I needed to file those motions,

20:49.200 --> 20:52.640
但我很迷惑 为什么你要转移我
but I have no idea why you needed to transfer me.

20:52.650 --> 20:54.490
人流管制  斯科菲尔德 就这样  很简单
Traffic control, Scofield.That's all.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.460
人流控制
Traffic control.

20:56.470 --> 20:59.490
瞧  快到五点了 今天就到这儿了怎么样
It's coming up on five o'clock. What do you say we call it a day?

20:59.500 --> 21:01.740
-恐怕我做不完了 先生  -为什么
-I don't think I can do that.  -Why not?

21:01.750 --> 21:05.010
如果我现在撤 这个会倒下来的
If I let go of this support right now,the whole thing's coming down.

21:05.020 --> 21:07.840
瞧  泰姬陵是用的轴向力
See, the Taj was designed using axial force

21:07.850 --> 21:11.450
一系列沿着一个轴的力
a series of internal forces along the longitudinal axis.

21:11.460 --> 21:13.420
嗯  那要多久呢
Yeah. How much longer?

21:13.430 --> 21:16.190
这就要看什么时候干了
Depends on how long it takes to dry.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.990
如果你要我走 我可以告诉你秘书怎么扶住它
If you need me to leave,I can show your secretary how to hold it.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.220
好吧  你可以留在这儿直到它干
You can stay till it dries.

21:21.230 --> 21:22.750
门外会有警卫
There'll be a guard waiting outside the door.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.010
你做完了就和 贝克 说一声
Just check in with Becky when you're done

21:24.020 --> 21:26.520
他会安排人送你回去
and she'll have somebody escort you back to your cell.

21:26.530 --> 21:31.180
-好的  -还有  嗯  斯科菲尔德
-All right.  -And, Scofield.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.740
很感谢你今天能来
I wanna thank you for showing up today.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.730
如果你不来  我也能理解的
I would've understood it if you didn't.

21:36.740 --> 21:39.150
-我们说定的不是嘛  -嗯
-We had a deal.  -Right.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.960
还是要谢谢你
Still, thanks.

21:40.970 --> 21:42.480
我妻子看到这个会非常喜欢的
My wife is gonna love it.

21:42.490 --> 21:45.780
不客气
You're welcome.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.120
明天见  先生
See you tomorrow, sir.

21:57.130 --> 22:01.430
晚安  监狱长先生
Good night, Warden.

22:01.740 --> 22:05.660
我们正巧是两个人 又碰巧彼此认识
We'd just happen to be two people who happen to know each other,

22:05.670 --> 22:07.710
一起出现在同一家戏剧院
who happen to show up at the same movie theatre

22:07.720 --> 22:11.240
还是同一个时间
at what happens to be the same time.

22:11.250 --> 22:15.490
是么
That's it.

22:51.090 --> 22:52.990
你知道  从这个角度看上去
You know, from this angle,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.810
你还是和我们刚认识时一样漂亮
you look just as good as you did when we first met.

22:55.820 --> 23:00.270
-这样呢   -更美了
-How about from this one?  -Even better.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.710
是给你那些客人的
Those are for your guests.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.880
-客人   -不是你的同事吗
-Guests?  -Your associates.

23:06.890 --> 23:11.340
他们说你在开会 所以先在里面等
They said you had a meeting.They're in the den.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.230
晚上好  监狱长先生
Evening, Warden.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.390
我也无能为力了
There's nothing I can do.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.740
我必须按照法律 把那些申请提交法庭
I'm legally obligated to file every properly drafted motion with the court

24:10.750 --> 24:12.330
以便于听证会安排
so a hearing can be scheduled.

24:12.340 --> 24:13.630
要花多长时间
And how long does that take?

24:13.640 --> 24:16.200
至少要一个月 如果不顺利  还有可能更长
A month, maybe two if there's a logjam

24:16.210 --> 24:17.910
很抱歉  不过这不归我管
I'm sorry, but it's out of my hands.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.490
为什么我感觉你好像无所谓的样子
Why do I feel you're not all that disappointed?

24:20.500 --> 24:23.390
我能问个问题吗  监狱长
May I ask you a question, Warden?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.890
只是据我观察而已
More of an observation, really.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.670
我刚看了那张照片  嗯
I was looking at the morgue photos

24:27.680 --> 24:31.350
就是那个男孩的照片   叫 威尔·克雷顿 是吧
from that boy back in Toledo ,Will Clayton

24:31.360 --> 24:37.100
和他爸爸还真像
and, my Lord,if he wasn't the spitting image of his daddy.

24:37.110 --> 24:40.970
感觉就像苹果从很高的树上掉下来  是吧
apple fell real far from the tree with that one, didn't it?

24:40.980 --> 24:44.970
从苹果树上掉下来 血肉模糊
fell off the tree, fell all over the pavement.

24:44.980 --> 24:47.210
你这个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

24:47.220 --> 24:50.070
你的妻子看来原谅你了
Your wife gave you a pass on the affair,

24:50.080 --> 24:53.130
但是应该是最后的底线了吧
Something tells me that's pretty much all the forgiveness she's got left in her bag.

24:53.140 --> 24:55.800
特别是碰到私生子的时候
Especially when it comes to an illegitimate child.

24:55.810 --> 24:58.140
小威尔是怎么了
What happened with young Will,

24:58.150 --> 25:00.320
监狱长先生
Warden?

25:00.330 --> 25:01.580
给我滚出去
Get out of my house.

25:01.590 --> 25:05.300
赶紧处理掉 斯科菲尔德 的申请
Lose Scofield's paperwork.

25:05.310 --> 25:07.270
你们要留下来一起吃晚餐么
You gentlemen staying for dinner?

25:07.280 --> 25:09.250
谢谢了  不过我想我们该走了
Thanks, but I think we're on our way.

25:09.260 --> 25:11.820
朱迪  谢谢你的招待
Judy, it was a real pleasure.

25:11.830 --> 25:12.510
谢谢你
Thank you.

25:12.520 --> 25:16.760
这是我喝到的最好的冰红茶了
And that just may have been the best iced tea I've ever had.

25:16.770 --> 25:20.750
监狱长先生 真的应该好好珍惜现在的一切
Warden, better do everything you can to hold on to this one.

25:20.760 --> 25:25.060
-我会的  -很好
-I will.  -Good.

25:27.290 --> 25:28.900
没事儿吧你
Is everything all right?

25:28.910 --> 25:31.430
嗯  很好  别担心
Oh, yeah. Just fine. honey..

25:31.440 --> 25:34.290
只是有些未做完的工作而已
I just have a little unfinished work to take care of.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.010
我马上出去吃饭
I'll be right in.

25:36.020 --> 25:39.140
好的
OK.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.770
都搞定了
It's all clear.

26:18.780 --> 26:20.650
晚上好  林肯
Evening, Lincoln.

26:20.660 --> 26:21.990
医生  你来啦
Doctor.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.330
我今晚得给你做个体检
I'm supposed to give you a physical this evening.

26:25.340 --> 26:29.560
整个过程可能会比较繁琐
apologize in advance for the heavy dose of irony we're about to participate in.

26:29.570 --> 26:32.320
没关系  你也是例行公事
That's all right. Just doing your job.

26:32.330 --> 26:35.550
嗯  让政府知道你现在很健康
Yeah, well...Letting them know you're healthy enough to execute

26:35.560 --> 26:39.720
不过这可不是我从医的初衷
is not why I went to medical school.

26:39.730 --> 26:44.000
-很抱歉  -没关系
-I apologise.  -It's OK.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.580
好了
All right.

26:48.590 --> 26:51.800
嗯  我得了解下你的家族病史
I'm gonna need a family medical history from you.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.980
看看有没有遗传性的疾病
Any ailments or conditions that are hereditary.

26:54.990 --> 26:57.030
先从你母亲开始吧
start with your mom.

26:57.040 --> 27:01.020
-癌症 肝癌  -好的 你父亲呢
-Cancer. Liver.  -OK. Father?

27:01.030 --> 27:04.090
嗯  我小时候就分开了
Split when I was young.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.630
兄妹呢
Siblings.

27:06.640 --> 27:11.460
除了迈克尔还有别人吗
Anyone besides Michael?

27:11.470 --> 27:13.740
这儿可不大  林肯
Fox River's a small town, Lincoln.

27:13.750 --> 27:19.320
在这儿人们有足够多的时间闲聊
People around here don't have a whole lot to do besides time and talk.

27:19.330 --> 27:22.900
你们关系怎么样  很亲密吧
you close?

27:22.910 --> 27:26.650
以前是的
We were.

27:27.430 --> 27:29.730
-现在呢   -嗯
-How about now?  -Huh?

27:29.740 --> 27:33.520
现在关系怎么样呢
How about now?

27:34.640 --> 27:38.260
他的一生很惨
He has been abandoned his whole life

27:38.270 --> 27:45.880
父亲很早就抛弃他  母亲也走了 现在又轮到我
Dad, Mom ,she died young,and now me.

27:45.890 --> 27:48.020
所以就到这儿来了
Think that's why he's here?

27:48.030 --> 27:49.880
是否你的
Cos your

27:49.890 --> 27:53.940
你的死会再次勾起他的回忆
your death would feel like it's happening again

27:53.950 --> 27:56.100
我很早就离开他了
I abandoned him a long time ago.

27:56.110 --> 28:00.200
这就是他为什么会进监狱的原因吧
That's why he's here.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.820
威尔  十岁

28:24.820 --> 28:28.290
关门
Gates closing.

28:29.430 --> 28:32.430
-是时候了  -什么
-It's time.  -Time?

28:32.440 --> 28:34.520
哦  天哪  我们又得忙活开了
Oh, God. Here we go again.

28:34.530 --> 28:36.480
十五分钟后就得点名 你到底想干吗
Count's in 15 minutes. What are you doing?

28:36.490 --> 28:38.610
相信我  知道得越少对你越好
Trust me. The less you know, the better.

28:38.620 --> 28:41.280
我知道的越少  伙计  我可还什么都不知道呢
The less I know? Man,You got me in the dark.

28:41.290 --> 28:45.780
这样才好啊
That's exactly where you wanna be.

28:49.780 --> 28:53.530
这个时间很少看到你嘛
Don't normally find you here at this hour.

28:53.540 --> 28:59.280
是来忏悔  还是需要神的建议
Are you seeking his forgiveness? Or advice?

28:59.290 --> 29:03.390
我也不清楚  本
I really don't know any more, Ben.

29:03.400 --> 29:09.230
我知道我应该为我儿子的事负责的
All I know is my son Will was my responsibility.

29:09.240 --> 29:11.850
我要是不走 也许他就不会出事儿
If I'd stayed in his life, I could've saved his life.

29:11.860 --> 29:16.720
他的死只是个意外  亨利
His death was an accident, Henry.

29:18.590 --> 29:23.390
虽然他是个罪犯  还吸毒
He was a criminal,and an addict

29:23.400 --> 29:25.240
但他毕竟只有十八岁啊
but he was only 18 years old.

29:25.250 --> 29:28.950
可他母亲说的很清楚 如果想和她在一起
His mother made it clear you couldn't be in his life

29:28.960 --> 29:30.360
你就得离开你儿子
if you weren't gonna be in hers.

29:30.370 --> 29:33.540
你既然选择跟朱迪在一起 你就应该了解这些
When you chose to stay with Judy,you understood that.

29:33.550 --> 29:37.980
我不仅想到了 而且很感激
I not only understood it, I was grateful for it.

29:37.990 --> 29:39.780
我告诉自己
I told myself

29:39.790 --> 29:43.470
我尊重了她的意愿
I was respecting her wishes.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.370
虽然我很恨她
I cursed her

29:45.380 --> 29:48.230
但每天我还是感谢上帝
under my breath while every day I thanked God

29:48.240 --> 29:51.290
让我从这件事里面
for allowing me to wash my hands of...

29:51.300 --> 29:55.310
解脱出来
Of Toledo.

29:55.320 --> 29:59.050
为了所有这一切
All of it.

29:59.060 --> 30:04.610
所以  我回到朱迪身边
So I ran home,to Judy,

30:04.620 --> 30:08.690
把秘密埋藏心底
I buried the secret.

30:08.700 --> 30:12.400
但我却连
But I never got a chance to...

30:12.410 --> 30:15.760
亲手埋葬
to bury my...

30:20.520 --> 30:24.810
自己儿子的机会都没有
my son.

30:27.990 --> 30:31.270
我算是什么样的人啊 本
What kind of a person does that, Ben?

30:31.280 --> 30:39.120
为了自己的利益就不顾及别人的性命
Sacrifices somebody else's life just to make their own life easier.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.540
你们可以整晚和我争论
You can argue with me all night.

30:41.550 --> 30:44.000
我真的无能为力了
Believe me,I haven't got anything better to do.

30:44.010 --> 30:49.390
但我确实不能把作为证据的原始带给你们
But it won't change the fact that I can't just hand out original copies of evidence.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.470
哪怕你就看一眼
If you could just take a look...

30:50.480 --> 30:53.470
哦  你就是有司法部长的签名都不行
Oh, I don't care if your FOIL is signed by the attorney general,

30:53.480 --> 30:54.530
我还是不能给你们
I can't give it to you.

30:54.540 --> 30:56.410
那我们是否可以带人过来 在现场看一下呢
What if we brought somebody here to watch it?

30:56.420 --> 30:58.780
你们可以派人盯着他
Your supervisor could monitor him the entire time.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.970
可以搜身  或者发誓
He'd strip down and swear on a stack of Bibles.

31:00.980 --> 31:04.780
-怎样做都可以  -等等 你们要的文件编号多少
-Whatever it takes.  -Wait, what did you say the docket number was?

31:04.790 --> 31:09.010
嗯  是 296-SPE
It's 296-SPE

31:09.020 --> 31:10.750
有什么问题么
What's wrong?

31:10.760 --> 31:14.680
跟我来
Come with me.

31:17.390 --> 31:21.340
昨晚  一根水管爆裂 淹了整间房间
Last night a pipe burst upstairs,flooded the place.

31:21.350 --> 31:23.250
一百多个案子的档案
Files from over 100 cases

31:23.260 --> 31:26.900
可能大部分都没了  包括你们要的
pretty much lost all of them, including yours.

31:26.910 --> 31:32.260
-只冲了这间房子?   -谁说得清呢 灾难
-Just this room?  -Some kind of freak accident.

31:42.710 --> 31:47.160
-点名  -克林汉姆
-Count'em.  -Callahan..

31:47.170 --> 31:51.840
马里若夫斯基  伯莱恩
Malinowski, Pohlen.

32:34.450 --> 32:37.490
查恩斯  格拉齐亚诺
Chance, Graziano.

32:37.500 --> 32:42.540
斯科菲尔德  苏克雷
Scofield, Sucre.

32:47.390 --> 32:50.120
斯科菲尔德
Scofield,

32:50.130 --> 32:53.960
快给我出来
get the hell out here.

33:01.370 --> 33:04.880
有人越狱
We got a runner.

33:34.200 --> 33:37.270
好吧  再问你一遍  小鸡巴
All right. For the last time, pini Ata.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.840
斯科菲尔德 到底到哪儿去了
Where the hell's Scofield?

33:38.850 --> 33:41.600
如果他跑了  你就不会好过  懂不
He's gone, you're gone. You hear me?

33:41.610 --> 33:43.290
取消警报吧  队长
Call it off, Captain.

33:43.300 --> 33:45.640
-我知道斯科菲尔德在哪儿  -哪儿
-I got Scofield right here.  -Where?

33:45.650 --> 33:48.480
在监狱长办公室呢
In the warden's office.

33:48.490 --> 33:50.850
你亲眼看见的
you looking at him?

33:50.860 --> 33:56.490
别光泡马子了 到里面去看看
Stop trying to nail the secretary.and check the damn office.

34:01.890 --> 34:06.880
队长  他跑了
Captain, he's gone.

34:22.640 --> 34:26.540
英格力士街

34:35.520 --> 34:39.860
博西街

34:46.360 --> 34:50.650
费兹街

35:05.710 --> 35:08.080
-他不可能就这样蒸发掉的  -明白  先生
-man can'tjust vanish.deputy.  -I know, sir.

35:08.090 --> 35:09.440
-他从来没出来过么   -没有
-He never checked out?  -No.

35:09.450 --> 35:11.430
-那后门呢   -我查过了 锁着呢
-and the rear door?  -It's still locked, sir. I checked.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.700
那他到底是
How the hell did he...?

35:13.710 --> 35:15.380
出什么事儿了
What's going on?

35:15.390 --> 35:17.090
你在这里待的太久了
You're in the warden's office after hours.

35:17.100 --> 35:20.780
我可以现在就杀了你 不用负任何责任
I could kill you and the paperwork wouldn't need more than a date.

35:20.790 --> 35:26.120
-告诉我  你究竟在这儿干吗   -好了  行了
-Tell me, what were you doing in here?  -All right, Deputy. That's enough.

35:27.180 --> 35:30.740
胶水还没干呢  是你让我留在这儿的
work wasn't dry.You said to stay until it was.

35:30.750 --> 35:32.770
-你一直待在这儿的么   -是的  先生
-You were in here?  -Yes, sir.

35:32.770 --> 35:34.300
是的  我没看到他出去过
-It's true. I never saw him leave.

35:34.310 --> 35:36.170
可能我没注意他在桌子后面呢
I must not have seen him behind the table.

35:36.180 --> 35:38.250
监狱长  这一切简直太荒唐了
Warden, all due respect, this is ridiculous!

35:38.260 --> 35:39.560
犯人居然不在牢房里
This prisoner was out of his cell.

35:39.570 --> 35:42.510
-还错过了点名  -我知道了 副官
-He missed the count.  -I understand, Deputy.

35:42.520 --> 35:46.280
事实是 现在 斯科菲尔德 已经不再是问题了
thing is,Mr Scofield is not our problem any more.

35:46.290 --> 35:48.160
看起来他的档案出了些问题
Seems there was an error in his paperwork.

35:48.170 --> 35:50.080
马上他就得被转移了
He's gonna be transferred after all.

35:50.090 --> 35:52.270
这不可能
That's not possible.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.190
把犯人押回牢房去
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.830
狱长  我只需要三周而已
Warden, all I need is three weeks.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.290
-放开我  -嘿  快点
-Get off me!  -Hey, come on, now!

36:00.300 --> 36:02.340
求你了  我只需要一点时间
please. I just need a little time.

36:02.350 --> 36:05.750
就一点点时间而已
Just give me the time.

36:07.170 --> 36:10.370
你觉得那仅仅是个巧合吗
Any chance you want to write this off as a coincidence?

36:10.380 --> 36:11.790
我也不这么认为
Me neither.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.620
他们怎么会知道我们要那盘带子
How could they have known we were coming for the tape?

36:13.630 --> 36:15.680
三小时前 我们还不认识呢
Three hours ago, we didn't even know.

36:15.690 --> 36:17.490
也许  我们得罪人了
Well,We're pissing someone off.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.690
似乎你还很开心
You say that like it's a good thing.

36:19.700 --> 36:24.520
有人在妨碍司法公正 不过我们还得有信心
People start breaking the law,you know you're getting warm.

36:25.970 --> 36:30.940
我们手上还有复制的  也许
We still have our copy of the tape, so maybe...

36:33.250 --> 36:37.330
-尼克  -待这别动
-Nick.  -Stay here.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.840
不知道是谁  已经走了
Whoever it was has gone.

36:54.850 --> 36:59.580
-有东西丢了么   -没有
-Does it look like they got anything?  -No.

37:03.170 --> 37:08.470
好像什么都没动过
Everything's exactly the way I left it.

37:15.330 --> 37:19.050
怎么啦   怎么啦
What? What?

37:20.330 --> 37:21.750
怎么啦
What?

37:21.760 --> 37:23.880
-带子没了  -你确定吗
-The tape. It's gone.  -Are you sure?

37:23.890 --> 37:25.420
-他们怎么知道   -我们得冷静地想想
-How could they know?-Think this through.

37:25.430 --> 37:27.370
他们怎么知道带子就放在这儿
How could they know exactly where to look?

37:27.380 --> 37:29.430
等等  还有其他人有这儿的钥匙么
Wait. Does anyone else have a key?

37:29.440 --> 37:32.430
-你确定是放这儿的么   -当时你也在啊  记得么
-Are you sure this is where you put it?  -You were here, remember?

37:32.440 --> 37:35.040
我当时跟你说话  然后就走到这儿了
I was talking to you, I walked toward the cabinet,

37:35.050 --> 37:38.890
然后我说
and I said...

37:38.900 --> 37:41.970
怎么了
What?

37:41.980 --> 37:43.340
维罗妮卡
Veronica,

37:43.350 --> 37:47.060
没事儿吧
are you OK?

37:50.000 --> 37:53.520
维罗妮卡
Veronica.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.540
开门
Open up!

38:03.690 --> 38:06.290
早餐时间  都出来
Breakfast, gentlemen. Let's move it.

38:06.300 --> 38:08.460
苏克雷  走吧 斯科菲尔德  你留在这儿
Sucre, let's go. Scofield, wait here.

38:08.470 --> 38:13.130
估计马上就会把你送走
I'm sure your ride'll be along any minute now.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.370
不应该这样
This can't be it.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.750
事情不能就这样结束
It can't end like this.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.020
快点出来
Let's move it.

38:26.030 --> 38:29.230
-费兹街   -什么
-Fitz.  -What?

38:29.240 --> 38:32.360
我们可以从费兹街逃走
We were gonna take Fitz out.

38:32.370 --> 38:36.560
毫无疑问
It was as clear as day.

38:36.570 --> 38:39.220
警察呢  他们多久会到
And the cops? How long did it take them to respond?

38:39.230 --> 38:43.210
你都算过了
You got all the timing down?

38:45.260 --> 38:49.390
我们有足够时间
Think we would've made it?

38:49.900 --> 38:54.380
苏克雷  快点
Sucre, now.

40:02.970 --> 40:07.350
嘿 嫩鸡  你到哪儿去
Hey, fishface, where are you going?

40:18.300 --> 40:24.640
打电话给我妻子  告诉她带着孩子离开这个国家
Call my wife. Tell her to get the kids and get the hell out of the country.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.790
对不起
I'm sorry.

41:01.170 --> 41:05.200
别忘了系安全带
Don't forget to buckle up.

41:06.590 --> 41:08.770
这个犯人在这里干吗啊
What's this prisoner doing out of his cell?

41:08.780 --> 41:12.060
-要被转移  -不 不 不 不
-being transferred.  -No,no,no,no,

41:12.070 --> 41:13.580
肯定有些误会
There must be some kind of a mistake.

41:13.590 --> 41:15.310
他昨天才提交了份申请
This man filed a motion yesterday.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.860
他身体有问题 不适合现在被转送
He has a medical condition which precludes transfer.

41:18.870 --> 41:23.620
-鼻窦炎 是吧   -鼻窦炎
-Sinusitis, right?  -Sinusitis.

41:23.630 --> 41:25.270
把他送回牢房去
Take the prisoner back to his cell.

41:25.280 --> 41:30.300
但得扣放风时间 他昨晚没有点名
But yank his rec time. He missed count last night.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.160
回来的好早 你没事儿吧
You're home early. Everything OK?

42:15.170 --> 42:16.610
是啊
Yeah.

42:16.620 --> 42:19.210
恩  没什么
Yeah, it is.

42:19.220 --> 42:23.500
只是  嗯
There's just...

朱迪
Judy,

42:32.040 --> 42:36.880

there's someone I need to tell you about.

42:39.150 --> 42:40.340
喂
Yes?

42:40.350 --> 42:44.210
-转监狱没有能够成功    -真令人失望
-The transfer did not go through.   -That's disappointing.

42:44.220 --> 42:48.070

-We can refile, but the warden...   -It's a waste of time.

42:48.080 --> 42:51.500
我想我们别尽做些表面文章了  先生们
I think it's time we stopped beating around the bush,gentlemen,

Take the only thing Burrows has left...time.

43:02.510 --> 43:07.110
