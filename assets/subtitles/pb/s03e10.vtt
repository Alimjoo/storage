WEBVTT

00:22.390 --> 00:24.930
还给了我钱  让我向她汇报你们的动静
And offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back.

00:24.940 --> 00:26.000
按计划行事  是吧?
So we stick to the plan, right?

00:26.010 --> 00:27.020
是啊
Yeah. cool.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.740
我找到一本护照  谁是格雷 米勒?
I found a passport. who's Gary Miller?

00:29.820 --> 00:31.950
我正努力让我们能在一起
I've been working on a way for us to be together.

00:32.010 --> 00:34.190
詹姆斯  你要我还怎么信你?
James, how-how can I believe you?

00:34.800 --> 00:36.950
你要我怎么相信其他事?
Hocan I believe anything anymore?

00:50.370 --> 00:51.590
还有个办法出去?
We got a way out of this?

00:51.590 --> 00:53.400
要弄点东西来支撑隧道
We need some kind of support brace for thtunnel.

00:53.410 --> 00:57.730
- 不然的话呢?  - 一旦倒塌  我们就都被活埋了
Or what? or the whole thing collapses, and we're buried alive.

01:03.380 --> 01:04.830
别再找借口了
No more excuses.

01:04.930 --> 01:07.100
由于这个美国佬  兄弟都死了
Papa's dead because of this yankee.

01:07.430 --> 01:09.490
如果必要  我会亲手宰了他  行吧?
I'll kill him myself if I have to, all right?

01:09.500 --> 01:10.850
他从那蒸笼里活着出来了
He survived the box.

01:10.860 --> 01:11.870
那又如何?
So what?

01:16.550 --> 01:18.310
警卫们都看着斯科菲尔德
The guards went after Scofield.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.650
他赢了
Scofield won.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.160
他都成英雄了
He's a folk hero now.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.620
听着  我和你一样  都想要斯科菲尔德死
Look, I want Scofield dead as much as you,

01:26.630 --> 01:28.820
但绝不能引起造反
But not at the cost of an uprising.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.050
有信件
Mail call.

02:26.890 --> 02:27.890
那是谁?
Who's that?

02:29.700 --> 02:30.750
是我儿子
That's my son.

02:31.830 --> 02:34.460
蒂博格 说行了   机会来了
Bagwell gave the okay. the coast is clear.

02:34.830 --> 02:35.850
走吧
We gotta go.

02:41.190 --> 02:42.880
我以为再见不到你了
I didn't think I'd see you again.

02:43.870 --> 02:46.030
一旦被关进那蒸笼  就...
Once someone goes into the box, it's...

02:46.220 --> 02:47.790
是场误会罢了
It was a misunderstanding.

02:48.980 --> 02:51.120
他们想要你说直升机的事  是吧?
They wanted to talk to you about the helicopters, right?

02:51.450 --> 02:52.980
什么直升机?
What helicopters?

02:54.690 --> 02:56.090
你是真的想要越狱么?
Were you really trying to escape?

02:56.150 --> 02:58.580
我不知道你说什么  你自己也不清楚吧
I don't know what you're talking about, and neither do you.

03:00.830 --> 03:04.570
你也知道了   蒂博格也加入了
Just so you know, Bagwell's coming with us.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.610
那时你走了
You were gone.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.880
而他拥有我们所需要的东西
He had something we needed.

03:07.890 --> 03:09.030
我别无选择
I didn't have a choice.

03:13.970 --> 03:15.180
好吧
Fine.

03:15.210 --> 03:16.610
新计划是怎样的?
So what's the new plan?

03:24.890 --> 03:25.900
你跟他说了么?
Did you tell him?

03:25.910 --> 03:26.610
是的
Yeah.

03:26.620 --> 03:27.960
我加入你们了
I am coming with you.

03:27.970 --> 03:29.100
行了  知道了
Okay by me.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.990
都听到了吧? 你听到了吧 警察兄?
Everyone hear that? you hear that, lawman?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.150
不过你得在这看着
But you're staying up here.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.140
是不是我说的不够清楚啊
Maybe I didn't enunciate myself.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.720
去下面干活需要两只手的
The work downstairs requires two hands.

03:40.200 --> 03:44.640
我们需要有人在这看着  以防萨米回来
Hey. we need somebody to stay outside in case Sammy returns.

04:07.630 --> 04:09.830
我想我们不能从这挖
I thought we couldn't dig through this stuff.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.120
支撑处很危险
The bracing's gonna be tricky.

04:11.130 --> 04:12.830
除非有合适的支撑点
Unless the tunnel gets the proper support,

04:12.840 --> 04:14.580
否则就会全塌下来
It's all going to come down on our heads.

04:14.830 --> 04:16.410
所以我们得弄东西支撑隧道
We should have the materials for the braces,

04:16.420 --> 04:19.150
不过我们需要锯子来切割  还要一个锤子
But we'll need a a saw to cut tto size. and a hammer.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.750
你能弄到么?
Can you help us out?

04:22.150 --> 04:23.340
是的  可以
Yeah. I can do that.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.560
两天时间
Two days.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.180
要是不行呢?
And if not?

04:31.810 --> 04:32.990
两天时间
Two days.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.170
威廉 应该有我们要的东西
Guillermo should have everything we need.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.280
你知道他在哪  是吧?
You know where he is, right?

04:39.290 --> 04:41.200
我想在  呃...
I think it's, uh...

04:41.210 --> 04:42.860
在走廊的左边
It's down this corridor on the left.

04:42.870 --> 04:45.370
在中间   40号房间
Halfway down. cell 40.

04:46.530 --> 04:48.900
走廊那边  左边
Down the corridor on the left.

04:48.910 --> 04:50.940
40号房  行了
Cell 40. okeydoke.

05:05.290 --> 05:07.030
你迷路了么  蒂博格?
Are you lost already, Teodoro?

05:07.980 --> 05:09.110
不
No.

05:11.630 --> 05:12.970
迷路的是你
But you are.

05:44.650 --> 05:46.350
这个房间归我了
This is my room now.

05:50.630 --> 05:51.900
你玩完了
You're done in here.

05:52.950 --> 05:54.950
要是今天你肯做了斯科菲尔德
If you had gone after Scofield today,

05:55.380 --> 05:56.720
那就还值得原谅
All would have been forgiven.

05:56.730 --> 05:57.750
这是在自杀
This is suicide.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.080
闭嘴  老家伙
Shut up, old man!

06:00.700 --> 06:02.020
我倒要试一试
I'll take my chances.

06:02.150 --> 06:05.030
你以为你可以管理索纳?
You think you can run sona?

06:05.040 --> 06:07.870
你连运送东西都办不了
You couldn't even run shipments from one dock to the other,

06:08.200 --> 06:10.250
但是我还一直留着你
But I still keep you by my side.

06:15.450 --> 06:17.130
我会让你走出这扇门
I'll let you walk out of here

06:17.320 --> 06:19.410
让你颜面无存
Out of respect for what you were.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.380
来啊
Come on!

06:25.340 --> 06:26.740
滚出去
Get the hell out of here!

06:34.580 --> 06:35.860
大家都准备好了么?
All of you ready to do this?

06:41.690 --> 06:42.970
在勒齐回来前
Until Lechero gets back,

06:42.980 --> 06:44.170
我们要找些这个
We should start looking for pieces

06:44.180 --> 06:45.730
大约四尺长
About four feet in length.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.030
现在  这里归我管了
I'm running things now!

07:24.670 --> 07:26.380
任何人有意见的话...
Anyone got problem with that...

07:29.240 --> 07:30.520
就过来拿
...come get it!

07:39.340 --> 07:40.420
很好
Good.

07:41.830 --> 07:43.590
第一件事：
First order of business,

07:44.990 --> 07:48.610
谁给我带来迈克·斯科菲尔德  这浪姆酒就归谁
A case of rum to the man who brings me Michael Scofield!

08:26.410 --> 08:28.440
放心
Don't worry.

08:28.450 --> 08:30.440
我们会带齐现钞过来的
We'll be there with all the cash.

08:30.450 --> 08:32.150
行么?  谢谢
Okay? gracias.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.590
奥斯贝托  这就是你要找的人
Osberto. that's who you want to talk to.

08:36.790 --> 08:38.020
这家伙能耐够大么?
This guy on the up-and-up?

08:38.140 --> 08:40.750
我进索纳的事就是他安排的
The guy I was running things into sona for arranged this,

08:40.760 --> 08:43.160
所以这事应该也能办成的
So it's as up as it's gonna get for this kind of deal. so, yes.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.590
不过   奥斯贝托不会说英语
Osberto doesn't speak english, though,

08:45.590 --> 08:47.250
那你准备怎么做?
So how do you want to work it?

08:47.260 --> 08:48.780
我得去见苏珊
I need to meet with Susan.

08:48.790 --> 08:50.360
我会带上索菲亚   她能帮我翻译
I'll take Sofia. she can translate for me.

08:50.370 --> 08:51.530
不用担心
Don't worry about it.

08:52.410 --> 08:55.700
见到苏珊后  你要我怎么说?
So when I meet with Susan, what do you want me to tell her?

08:56.200 --> 08:57.960
她想听什么  你就告诉她什么
Tell her whatever you think she wants to hear.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.090
帮我们尽量争取时间  行么?
Just buy us enough time to do our thing, all right?

09:00.490 --> 09:01.750
一切顺利   兄弟
Home stretch, papi.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.330
兄弟  我不知道怎么感谢你才好
Listen, man. I want to thank you for everything.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.690
- 林肯  拜托  - 回去后 我一定回报你
Oh, linc, please. when we get home, I got your back--

09:05.700 --> 09:07.280
你想要什么都可以
Whatever you need, whatever you want.

09:07.290 --> 09:08.860
什么都不需要
That won't be necessary.

09:08.910 --> 09:11.910
当我回家的时候  我会做个好公民
When I'm back home, I'm a saint.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.420
甚至连红灯都不会闯
I'm not even jaywalking.

09:14.550 --> 09:16.100
奥斯贝托  别忘了
Osberto. don't forget.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.500
奥斯贝托
Osberto.

09:38.030 --> 09:41.810
一旦斯科菲尔德从隧道出来  他就死定了
Scofield steps outside that tunnel, he's a dead man.

09:41.820 --> 09:43.270
我想我们有两条路
Far as I can tell, we have two options.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.090
要么让萨米入伙
We can invite Sammy on the escape...

09:46.100 --> 09:47.460
见你的鬼去吧！
He can go to hell.

09:47.970 --> 09:49.910
所以我们只能选择另一条路
Which brings us to option number two.

09:52.530 --> 09:54.500
你不会和萨米是一伙的吧
You wouldn't last a second in there with Sammy.

09:54.540 --> 09:55.690
那你呢
Would you?

09:59.690 --> 10:02.620
我想我们必须出去
Then I guess we'll just have to outsource.

10:10.450 --> 10:11.940
我觉得对不住那个伙计
I felt sorry for the guy,

10:11.950 --> 10:14.690
但是你必须要应战
But you don't chicken-foot an ex-delta force

10:14.700 --> 10:16.280
每个人都有求生的欲望
And expect to make it out alive.

10:16.290 --> 10:18.630
你赢了  像恰克·诺里斯一样
You're delta force? like Chuck Norris?

10:18.640 --> 10:21.160
诺里斯?  他在这里的话也不一定能赢
Norris? he wouldn't have made it through boot camp.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.500
等我一下
Excuse me a second.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.780
我看你交到新朋友了
I see you're making friends.

10:27.130 --> 10:28.090
一旦你赢了比赛
Hey, once you get the hang of it,

10:28.100 --> 10:29.530
这里就不再乏味了
This place ain't so rough.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.060
是的  很糟
Yeah. too bad.

10:32.060 --> 10:33.280
什么很糟
Too bad what?

10:34.910 --> 10:36.080
你是对的
You were right. we got

10:36.090 --> 10:38.840
我们有个计划  不过如果你不懂规矩
A little plan going on. but, you know, if you're putting down roots...

10:38.850 --> 10:41.220
不  不  你说...
No, no. you were saying...?

10:41.890 --> 10:44.920
我们要在48小时内设法逃离这里
We're supposed to be out of here in 48 hours.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.500
不是和斯科菲尔德一起吧
Not through Scofield.

10:46.550 --> 10:47.810
你听见刚才的喊话了吧
You heard the town crier.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.980
那个聪明仔的一条命也就值一箱酒
College boy's life is barely worth a case of booze.

10:51.140 --> 10:52.900
别转移话题
Hence our current conversation.

10:53.510 --> 10:56.080
我知道你昨天是怎么赢的
I know how you got your cherry yesterday,

10:58.730 --> 11:01.240
你在你绑手的带子上涂了丙酮
Daubing your wraps in acetone,

11:01.410 --> 11:04.370
捂住那家伙直到窒息而死
Smothering the guy until he passed out from the fumes.

11:05.390 --> 11:08.360
你若如法炮制弄死萨米  你就能跟我们走
You do the same thing to Sammy, and you're in.

11:09.370 --> 11:10.420
向萨米挑战
Chicken-foot Sammy?

11:10.430 --> 11:11.520
向萨米挑战
Chicken-foot Sammy.

11:13.860 --> 11:15.430
全靠你了  老大
It's all riding on you, champ.

11:31.190 --> 11:31.870
请拿好
Here you get it.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.090
谢谢
Thank you.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.340
不会耽误很久的
This shouldn't take long.

11:35.670 --> 11:36.650
你在做什么
What are you getting?

11:36.660 --> 11:38.340
-做准备  -什么准备?
Supplies. for?

11:38.980 --> 11:40.830
我不想打无准备之仗
I don't want to get caught flat-footed again.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.020
你知道是什么意思吗
You know no.what that means?

11:42.030 --> 11:44.460
这些人显然有他们的计划
Well, these people obviously have a plan.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.650
我们也要有一个计划
We're gonna need one, too.

11:45.660 --> 11:47.790
那计划包括营救詹姆斯吗
Does that plan include screwing over James?

11:48.820 --> 11:49.780
那家伙叫詹姆斯还是米勒?
Is it James or gary Miller?

11:49.790 --> 11:51.620
无论他叫什么
Whatever his name is, there's a part of me

11:51.630 --> 11:53.490
我不相信他会为他们卖命
That doesn't want to believe he works for them...

11:55.660 --> 11:55.730
因为
Cause he's

11:55.740 --> 11:56.910
我爱这个男人
The man I loved,

11:56.920 --> 11:58.520
这个男人因为我才进的监狱
The man who went to prison for me,

11:58.530 --> 12:01.170
我的第一次巴黎之旅就是和这个男人一起
The man who was going to take me to my first trip to paris.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.110
我不能背叛他
I haven't turned my back to that man.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.720
你能告诉我他是否还好
Do I have your word that he's gonna be all right?

12:08.480 --> 12:10.440
是的  上车吧
Yeah. now get in.

12:11.780 --> 12:13.020
你说明白点
Do I have your word?!

12:13.360 --> 12:15.230
我说了他很好
Yeah, you got my word.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.650
现在可以上车了
Now get in.

12:30.950 --> 12:34.630
Ed 我们马上能见面了  销售非常好!
Ed, we'll be in contact soon. Sales are through the roof!

12:34.640 --> 12:37.500
希望你还在忙你那块  格雷发
Hope you're working on your putting...Gary

12:49.450 --> 12:50.880
你知道我刚才发现了什么?
You know what st found out?

12:51.240 --> 12:53.090
"苏克雷"的意思就是"糖"
That "Sucre" means "sugar."

12:53.370 --> 12:54.720
是的
Yeah.

12:54.790 --> 12:56.820
所以每次我说到你的名字
So every time I say your name,

12:56.830 --> 12:58.310
我就用"糖"代替
I'm calling you "sugar."

12:59.850 --> 13:01.090
明白
Basically.

13:01.420 --> 13:02.590
我喜欢这么叫
I like that.

13:03.590 --> 13:06.260
我没有搞到很多消息
Look, I don't have a lot of information.

13:06.340 --> 13:09.280
对你来说很好  不是吗
Which, I guess, that's good ws for you, right?

13:10.100 --> 13:11.430
你能详细说下吗
You care to elaborate?

13:12.350 --> 13:14.160
林肯没有什么行动
Lincoln isn't cooking anything up.

13:14.430 --> 13:17.240
他还是在计划拿惠斯勒交换lj
He's still planning on exchanging Whistler for lj.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.230
他没提过什么别的计划
He hasn't been talking about running any games.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.150
昨晚他也没什么特别的行动吗
And did he become an eagle scout last night, too?

13:23.150 --> 13:25.490
小姐  他得到了消息  他知道只能这样
Lady, he got the message. he knows he doest have

13:25.500 --> 13:27.250
他决定就这么行动
A choice, he has to play it straight.

13:30.790 --> 13:32.820
我来这里告诉你这些
Look, I could have come up here and made something up

13:32.830 --> 13:34.140
只是想捞点钱  但是
Just to get paid, but...

13:36.270 --> 13:38.430
我对你没有别的企图
I'm not trying to get on your bad side either.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.610
你知道么
You know what?

13:41.650 --> 13:43.020
我相信你
I believe you.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.980
如果有什么进展我再联系你
So, I'll call you if anything comes up.

13:47.990 --> 13:49.720
当我是什么  不要脸的妓女?
Whoa, whoa! what am i, a toothless crack whore?

13:49.730 --> 13:51.000
坐下
Sit down.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.160
我会兑现承诺
I keep my promises.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.520
我上面的人
The people I work for, they don't like

14:01.530 --> 14:04.340
他们不在乎钞票  他们有的是钱
To deal in greenbacks; it's just too bulky.

14:04.610 --> 14:08.040
银行的支票  直接兑换现金
Cashier's check payable to cash. same thing.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.760
事成以后还有一半
Half now and half when you're done.

14:18.690 --> 14:20.390
甜心  盯紧点
Keep your ears open, sugar.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.970
阿历克斯  加把劲
Alex, come on!

14:35.670 --> 14:37.890
-用力  -我在用力
Hold it steady! I am! I am!

14:38.360 --> 14:40.570
我需要点帮助
I'm gonna need a little help here!

14:40.650 --> 14:41.870
加油
Come on.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.300
快好了  我知道可以的
I got it. I said I got it.

14:49.650 --> 14:51.800
这个小部件能承受所有的重量吗
Thittle piece of metal's gonna hold all this weight?

14:53.140 --> 14:54.280
好了
All right,

14:54.510 --> 14:56.590
我松手了
Let go, let go.

15:07.510 --> 15:09.190
我们还需要多少个撑钉
So, how many more are we gonna need

15:09.200 --> 15:10.500
才能上去?
Before we get to the top?

15:10.610 --> 15:12.050
或许20个吧
20 maybe.

15:12.060 --> 15:14.660
这也就是让我们能去禁入区  然后呢?
That gets us to no-man's land. then what?

15:14.750 --> 15:15.970
有直升机当然更好啦
Helicopter'd be nice.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.790
我本可以杀了你
I was supposed to kill you.

15:21.010 --> 15:22.580
所以你就不是什么渔夫
Oh, so you're not a fisherman?

15:23.200 --> 15:24.770
他们威胁要追杀我全家
They threatened to come after my family

15:24.780 --> 15:28.010
除非我杀了你  跳上直升机
If I didn't kill you and jump on that helicopter,

15:28.450 --> 15:29.530
但是我还是没有那么做
But I didn't.

15:29.540 --> 15:30.830
这么说我还该感激你
I'm so grateful.

15:31.110 --> 15:32.420
那你的家人怎么样了?
So what happened to your family?

15:32.430 --> 15:36.330
不知道  从这里出去后或许就能知道了
I don't know. maybe I'll find out if we ever get out of here.

15:36.780 --> 15:39.990
这个世界很疯狂  不是吗？
Well, it's a crazy world, isn't it?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.430
我们都会赞同这点的
We all agreen that.

15:41.430 --> 15:43.410
我们还有很多事要做
And we have a lot of work to do.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.550
该死的勒齐哪去了?
Where the hell is Lechero?

15:53.960 --> 15:55.010
-事情都办妥了?  -什么?
Is everything set? huh?

15:55.210 --> 15:56.820
事情都办妥了?
Is everything set?

15:56.830 --> 15:58.250
是的  没有问题
Yeah, noblemo.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.560
抱歉  先生
Excuse me, sir.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.200
如果需要鸡爪是不是来找你?
Do we come to you if we need the chicken foot?

16:15.920 --> 16:17.140
还穿虎纹裤子
Tiger pants.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.310
你和谁过不去?
Who you got a beef with?

16:19.320 --> 16:21.600
我不知道他的名字  是个加勒比海的家伙
I don't know his name. some caribbean guy.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.570
之前偷了我的皮夹子
Stole my wallet a while back.

16:25.810 --> 16:26.590
你最好想想清楚
Better think long and hard

16:26.600 --> 16:28.720
再开口  听到吗?
Before you say another word, eh?

16:29.370 --> 16:31.090
他留着撇小胡子
He's got this fruity little mustache

16:31.100 --> 16:32.850
穿了件奇丑无比的背心
And this ly-ass vest.

16:36.140 --> 16:39.170
接着  算我求你了
Please, I'm beggin' ya.

16:59.230 --> 17:01.720
15分钟后  场子里见
In the ring. 15 minutes.

17:16.090 --> 17:17.170
我从没有想过我会这么说
I never thought I'd say this,

17:17.180 --> 17:18.860
布拉德  但是我很欣赏你
But I envy you, Brad. I've wanted

17:18.870 --> 17:20.500
我打见到那小子起  就想手刃了他
To shank that little calypso kid

17:20.510 --> 17:22.810
我虽然不是天生暴力
Ever since I first met him. I'm not a violent guy by nature,

17:22.820 --> 17:25.150
但是如果有人逼我太甚的话...
But if a man makes me walk around in my grunts for two days...

17:25.160 --> 17:28.290
很不错  别折磨他太久  早点干掉
Yeah, that's great. just don't take too long to finish him off, okay?

17:28.300 --> 17:31.030
他死的越快  我们也可以快些逃出去
The sooner he's dead, the sooner we can get on the escape.

17:31.460 --> 17:32.610
说定了  我也算一个
No games. I'm in.

17:32.620 --> 17:33.670
算你一个
You're in.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.100
-不  不  -怎么了？
No, no, no. what's wrong?

17:37.110 --> 17:38.600
我们必须取消那场格斗
We got to call off the fight.

17:38.610 --> 17:40.030
不  这根本不可能
No, that's an impossibility.

17:40.040 --> 17:40.790
不  不
No, no, no,

17:40.800 --> 17:42.110
你根本不明白
You don't understand!

17:43.460 --> 17:45.220
这附近应该还有丙酮的
There's got to be more acetone around here.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.640
你说到点子上了  没有丙酮
No, that's it! I can't go against

17:47.820 --> 17:49.270
我去直面萨米的话  那死定了
Sammy straight up! I'm a dead man!

17:49.280 --> 17:52.240
你要是不杀了他  我们都玩完
If you don't kill him, we are all dead.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.400
这样的邻舍可不咋地
This isn't the best neighborhood.

18:17.790 --> 18:18.470
我还去过更糟的
I've been in a lot worse.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.760
跟紧点就是了
Just stick close.

18:27.650 --> 18:28.710
奥斯贝托?
Osberto?

18:30.430 --> 18:31.530
是的
Si.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.340
你想做交易吗？
You want to do this?

18:37.720 --> 18:38.880
现钞准备好了?
iene el dinero?

18:39.450 --> 18:41.100
是的  我准备好了
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

18:59.290 --> 19:00.530
钱在哪里？（西班牙语）
onde esta?

19:01.070 --> 19:02.220
钱在哪里？
"where is the money?"

19:07.020 --> 19:08.350
我想看货
I want to see the product.

19:13.260 --> 19:14.580
先付钱（西班牙语）
Primero el dinero.

19:14.580 --> 19:15.440
先付钱
"money first."

19:15.450 --> 19:16.540
我先看货
Show me the stuff.

19:16.670 --> 19:17.770
先付钱!
El dinero!

19:18.970 --> 19:20.310
林肯求你了  我们离开这吧
Lincoln, please, let's get out of here.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.690
告诉他别再浪费我的时间
Tell him to stop wasting my time.

19:22.650 --> 19:23.700
不行
No.

19:24.210 --> 19:25.250
和他说
Tell him.

19:47.870 --> 19:49.010
我的天啊!
Oh, my god!

19:54.510 --> 19:56.780
威力够大吗？
Big? it's grande?

19:57.350 --> 19:58.560
是的
Si.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.120
问他如何遥控引爆
Ask him how do I trigger it by remote.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.750
就爆了
Boom.

20:16.220 --> 20:18.100
拨号1-1 然后按发送键
"dial one-one, send."

20:18.260 --> 20:19.340
1-1 然后发送键?
One-one, send?

20:22.540 --> 20:23.460
再见
Adios.

20:23.470 --> 20:24.630
再见
Adios.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.860
祝你好运
Buena suerte.

20:27.740 --> 20:30.000
你为什么不告诉我你要买个炸弹?
Why didn't you tell me you were gonna buy a bomb?

20:30.010 --> 20:31.870
说了的话  你怎么也不会来了
You never d have come otherwise.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.530
这玩意当锯子不错
We need that saw.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.110
你们知道吗
You know, uh,

20:40.380 --> 20:41.830
我是名渔夫
I am a fisherman.

20:43.430 --> 20:45.350
我  或许我只是
I am. I'm just maybe

20:45.360 --> 20:47.100
被关注的超过本身多了些
A little bit more connected than I've let on.

20:49.010 --> 20:50.580
我觉得这东西能起作用
I think this is gonna work.

20:50.590 --> 20:51.630
是的
Yeah.

20:51.790 --> 20:55.580
你知道  我经营租赁  正如我说的那样
You know, I run charters, just like I said...

20:55.600 --> 20:56.870
都好几年了
I have for years.

20:57.330 --> 20:59.960
然后某一天  那个婊子格雷琴她问我
Then one day, that brunette, Gretchen well, she asked me

20:59.970 --> 21:02.360
是否愿意和她合作发财
If I wanted to be exclusive to her corporation, right?

21:03.300 --> 21:05.960
她开的价不低
And, uh, well, with the money she was offering,

21:05.970 --> 21:07.090
我很清楚  她肯定不是为了
I had a pretty good idea she wasn't

21:07.100 --> 21:08.410
捕鲑鱼这么简单
Just trawling for salmon.

21:09.220 --> 21:10.710
这么说  你们之间还发生过些事情
So you two have history.

21:10.740 --> 21:11.790
是的
Yeah. and she's

21:11.800 --> 21:13.610
她绝对是我此生的梦魇
Been an absolute nightmare in my life

21:13.900 --> 21:15.270
从第一个工作开始
Ever since that first job.

21:15.850 --> 21:17.290
阿历克斯  我需要一个楔子
Alex, I need a wedge.

21:17.430 --> 21:18.970
楔子
Wedge.

21:19.290 --> 21:21.390
如你们所见  我曾经把他们带到他们想去的地方
Look, I took 'em where they wanted me to take 'em.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.670
我得弄明白这些坐标
I have to figure outhese coordinates

21:22.680 --> 21:23.990
我必须把他们再带到那去
And I have to take them back there.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.340
不要再为难你自己了
Quit embarrassing yourself.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.480
什么?
What?

21:27.490 --> 21:29.430
我们不是2只你试图在鸡笼里面捡起的小鸡
We're not two chicks at a bar you're trying to pick up.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.420
你觉得呢?
This?

21:30.430 --> 21:32.720
你为组织工作
No. all right, good. you work for the company.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.930
当你从这里出去的时候
And when you break out of here, you're gonna do whatever

21:34.940 --> 21:36.180
你就会做组织要你做的一切
The company asks you to do,

21:36.750 --> 21:37.980
-没有了  -他们利用我
Period. well, they're using me

21:37.990 --> 21:39.310
正如他们利用你一样
Just like they're g you.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.830
很好  我很荣幸能和你分享这样的经历
Good, I'm glad you shared that with me.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.720
你为什么不回去工作?  这个建议听起来怎么样?
So why don't we go back to work? how's that sound?

21:51.450 --> 21:54.260
让那些笨蛋自己去争夺他们想要的一切吧
Let those idiots chickenfoot themselves all they want, huh?

21:54.440 --> 21:57.100
不过如果有人想给我们一个鸡爪...
But if one of them tries to use it on us...

21:59.340 --> 22:00.790
你不需要和那个人决斗
You don't have to fight that guy.

22:01.700 --> 22:02.980
这是辞别之旅
It's my farewell tour.

22:05.860 --> 22:07.610
剩下的几块质量不太好
The rest of those pieces are no good.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.550
我们需要那些工具  迈克
We're going to need those tools, Michael.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.040
我觉得我们只能等待了
I guess we'll just have to wait.

22:14.110 --> 22:17.020
你的那本书--
That book of yours-- it's just a bunch

22:17.030 --> 22:18.230
它里面只是一堆坐标  是吗
Of coordinates in there, right?

22:19.560 --> 22:20.990
那些坐标穿插在其他的东西里面
Among other things.

22:22.150 --> 22:23.960
那你肯定不会介意我看看
So you wouldn't mind.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.020
只是一串数字和日期
It's just a bunch of, uh, numbers and dates.

22:34.110 --> 22:35.240
"门"
"gate."

22:35.400 --> 22:36.860
"门网公司"
Gate netting company.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.480
是我租借渔网的地方
That's where I rent my trammels.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.110
"逃窜"
"stampede."

22:41.140 --> 22:42.570
那是我好友的"Cape islander"(一种渔船)
That's my buddy's cape islander.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.200
现在这对我们来说很重要吗
And this is important to us how?

22:44.210 --> 22:46.010
很重要  因为它们我被误会了
It's important because I'm being accused

22:46.020 --> 22:47.440
而且我不想
Of being someone I'm not. and I don't want

22:47.450 --> 22:48.600
斯科菲尔德在将来要离开的时候抛弃我
Scofield ditching me

22:48.610 --> 22:50.810
他没有抛弃任何人
Once it's time to leave... he's not ditching anybody.

22:50.820 --> 22:52.180
如果他能摆脱任何人
If he could have gotten rid of anybody,

22:52.190 --> 22:53.480
他也会摆脱我
He would have gotten rid of me.

22:53.490 --> 22:54.890
如果他试图离开这个城市
And if he tries to leave the city

22:54.900 --> 22:56.550
他知道我们会在他离开之前检举他
He knows that we're gonna turn him in before he gets out

22:56.560 --> 23:00.200
我上楼去找勒齐和他的工具
Of the city. I'm going upstairs to find Lechero and his equipment.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.660
我和阿历克斯一起
I'm with Alex.

23:02.590 --> 23:03.800
你介意吗
Do you mind?

23:08.610 --> 23:10.200
听起来上面有人
Sounds like someone's up there.

23:14.220 --> 23:15.760
如果是勒齐在上面陷入困境
If Lechero gets stranded up there,

23:15.770 --> 23:16.880
我们现在不能离开这里
We're not getting out of here.

23:16.890 --> 23:18.430
那么当你觉得安全的时候
So when you think it's safe,

23:18.440 --> 23:19.370
或者...
Or it feels like

23:19.380 --> 23:21.510
它确实变得安全的时候  我们就上去
It's safe, we got to go, we got to go up.

24:00.990 --> 24:03.170
几个月来我们一直在说要挑战萨米
We've been talking about chickenfooting Sammy for months.

24:03.340 --> 24:05.250
没人有那个勇气
No one had the courage.

24:05.970 --> 24:07.190
你有油漆稀释剂吗
Do you have any paint thinner?

24:07.200 --> 24:08.420
油漆稀释剂?
Paint thinner?

24:08.530 --> 24:09.560
鞋油
Shoe polish,

24:09.570 --> 24:11.470
打火机油  或者胶水?
Lighter fluid, glue?

24:14.370 --> 24:15.560
找到你了  冠军
There you are, champ.

24:16.270 --> 24:18.440
时间到了  重跺他的脸吧  布拉德!
It's time. stomp his face, Brad!

24:18.840 --> 24:21.260
你知道  这整个就是误会
You know, this has all been one big misunderstanding.

24:21.270 --> 24:22.920
我没有谈论萨米
I wasn't talking about Sammy.

24:22.930 --> 24:24.580
我谈论的是...是他!
It was... that's him.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.320
他才是我谈论的那个人
That's the guy I was talking about.

24:26.330 --> 24:28.130
我可没看见他有"恶心的胡子"
Yeah, I don't see no "fruity moustache,"

24:28.140 --> 24:30.000
而且那"丑陋的汗衫"在哪  布拉德?
And where's his "ugly-ass vest," Brad?

24:30.060 --> 24:33.780
不必担心  你有真正的机会赢了这局
Don't worry, you stand a real chance of winning this one.

24:42.630 --> 24:44.370
你不能整天这样躲着外面
You cannot just hide out all day.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.380
我还能做什么?
What else can I do, huh?

24:46.530 --> 24:48.600
我残酷的统治了这些人一年
I've ruledhese men for a year with blood.

24:48.610 --> 24:50.300
你不知道他们多么渴望干掉老大
You don't think those men want to take the head of the man

24:50.310 --> 24:52.490
无论如何
Who wore the crown? be that as it may,

24:53.390 --> 24:56.080
贝里克就要把他的头输给萨米了
Bellick is about to lose his head to Sammy.

24:57.090 --> 24:58.670
你可能不想听这些
You may not want to hear this,

24:58.680 --> 25:01.310
一旦这事发生  我们都十分清楚
But once that happens, we are both very much

25:01.320 --> 25:02.700
斯科菲尔德就会好奇
Aware that Scofield is gonna start

25:02.710 --> 25:04.190
你到底在哪里
Getting curious about where the hell you are.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.950
他就会爬出他的洞
He's going to come crawling out of his hole

25:05.960 --> 25:08.060
正好到萨米的手下
And right into Sammy's arms,

25:08.070 --> 25:10.100
然后他和我们的越狱大计
And then he and our escape

25:10.110 --> 25:11.670
就永远消失了
Are gone forever.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.320

跟上
Come on

26:56.250 --> 26:57.850
你们想要看看决斗吗
You guys want to watch the fight?

26:59.720 --> 27:00.970
颤抖吧
You know, chill out.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.430
我会给你拿瓶啤酒
I'll get you a beer.

27:37.890 --> 27:38.870
你喜欢那样?
You like that?

27:39.300 --> 27:40.730
你喜欢那样?
You like that?

27:53.630 --> 27:54.760
停下!
Stop it.

27:55.170 --> 27:56.150
斯科菲尔德!
Scofield!

28:10.090 --> 28:11.560
斯科菲尔德在这里
Scofield's in there.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.720
-锁上了  -开门
It's locked. open the door.

28:14.190 --> 28:15.490
我没有密码
I don't have the combination.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.150
我说...
I said...

28:16.160 --> 28:17.680

We can't.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.330
现在打开!
Open it now.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.030
我没有密码
I don't have the combination.

28:27.350 --> 28:30.770
我手上有你的人
I've got your man out here.

28:30.980 --> 28:32.370
如果你们不开门的话
If you don't open the door,

28:32.600 --> 28:34.490
他就要付出代价
He's the one who's going to pay the price.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.490
他得活着!
I need him alive!

28:36.500 --> 28:38.760
你看过那些人  你难道不知道他们打算干什么?
You saw those guys. what do you think they've got planned?

28:38.780 --> 28:40.790
你们正在挑战我的耐心
All of you is trying my patience.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.550
你有什么建议  阿历克斯?
What do you suggest, Alex?

28:44.300 --> 28:45.620
我们得准备好
Let's be ready for them.

28:48.550 --> 28:49.710
时间到了
Time's up.

28:53.810 --> 28:55.120
你还想再挨一下吗
You want another one?

28:55.740 --> 28:57.400
那你得坚强点
Then you better be persuasive.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.020
迈克
Michael.

29:04.780 --> 29:06.040
别开门!
Don't open the door!

29:06.050 --> 29:07.620
他有枪!
He's got a gu...!

29:13.960 --> 29:16.710
-你不打算和我解释一下吗?  -不
Are you going to tell me what it's for? no.

29:17.030 --> 29:18.750
你怕我告诉詹姆斯?
Because you think I might tell James?

29:18.770 --> 29:20.180
因为你没必要知道
Because you don't need to know.

29:23.880 --> 29:24.780
嗨
Hey.

29:26.470 --> 29:27.720
不会有事的
It's going to be all right.

29:32.470 --> 29:35.250
-怎么样?  -很好  我说了她想听到的话
How'd it go? good. I told her what she wanted to hear,

29:35.260 --> 29:36.260
就象你事先告诉我的那样
Just like you told me.

29:36.270 --> 29:38.340
-是吗?  -对
That it? yeah.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.600

Cool. listen, I want you to call her up,

29:41.610 --> 29:42.940
告诉她你这有些情报
Tell her you've got some information.

29:43.130 --> 29:45.390
一定要让她来接你  然后上她的车  明白了?
Make sure she picks you up, and get in the car, all right?

29:45.480 --> 29:47.090
好的  没什么问题吧?
Okay. is everything okay?

29:48.030 --> 29:49.540
没有  为什么这么问?
Yeah. why?

29:49.540 --> 29:50.800
她看起来很不安
She looks upset.

29:52.630 --> 29:53.860
我回头给你电话
I'll call you later.

30:01.980 --> 30:03.890
迈克  我找到一个我们能用得上的东西
Got something down here we can use, Michael.

30:10.380 --> 30:11.850
如果他们从那扇门进来
If they come through that door...

30:12.890 --> 30:14.170
你就在这里给他们致命打击
You hit 'em right here.

30:14.630 --> 30:15.910
快拿着
Go ahead, take it.

30:16.350 --> 30:17.700
拿着!
Go ahead.

30:19.690 --> 30:21.390
这东西能穿透心脏
It'll puncture the heart.

30:45.310 --> 30:45.980
你把斯科菲尔德藏在
You were hiding

30:45.990 --> 30:47.430
你房间里了?
Scofield in your room?

30:47.450 --> 30:50.740
你看看  权力已经让你失去理智
Look at you-- the power make you mad already.

30:52.670 --> 30:53.810
来吧  诺曼  我们走
Come along, Norman.

30:54.150 --> 30:55.320
我们走
Let's go.

31:27.510 --> 31:28.860
什么事情这么着急?
What is so urgent?

31:28.870 --> 31:30.020
林肯买了一把枪
Lincoln bought a gun.

31:30.030 --> 31:33.200
我...  我问他打算用来干什么
I... I asked him what he planned on doing with it,

31:33.210 --> 31:34.500
他没有回答我
But he wouldn't answer.

31:34.550 --> 31:37.610
我觉得...  我想我也许应该告诉你
So I just... I just thought you might want to know.

31:37.870 --> 31:40.250
如果有什么变化我再向你报告  好吗?
If anything changes, I'll get back to you, okay?

31:41.060 --> 31:42.440
你知道吗  那天你和林肯
You ow, the other day

31:42.580 --> 31:45.680
在大堂那吵了起来
When you and lincoln had your little spat in the lobby

31:45.690 --> 31:48.190
我看你撕心裂肺地
And you-- all distraught and jilted--

31:48.200 --> 31:50.600
跑到对面街的酒吧里
Went across the street to the bar,

31:50.610 --> 31:53.410
明眼人一看就知道你们在演戏
A cynic might think that was staged.

31:56.630 --> 31:58.180
我的眼睛就挺亮的  宝贝
I'm a cynic, sugar.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.070
是你想晕了头  宝贝
You're high, sugar.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.660
不过演得还是挺逼真的  差点把我也给蒙了
If it's any comfort, you guys almost pulled it off.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.480
什么波多黎各人啦  大猩猩啦
The puerto rican and the gorilla--

32:04.490 --> 32:06.810
还真地让我为你们揪心了一会儿
You really had me scrambling there for a minute.

32:06.820 --> 32:08.830
如果你不需要我的帮助就算了  我退出!
Hey, if you don't want my help, fine, I'm out, okay?

32:08.840 --> 32:11.480
我只不过是根据我给你
It's a little thing called a tracing number--

32:11.810 --> 32:13.990
那张支票的号码顺藤摸瓜而已
On the check I gave you.

32:14.910 --> 32:16.940
很显然  那天你没把
Apparently your extensive expertise

32:16.950 --> 32:18.110
你在银行方面丰富的专业知识
In banking

32:18.120 --> 32:19.410
带在身上
Failed you that day.

32:19.610 --> 32:21.680
你迫不及待地把两万五美金
You promptly wired all 25 k

32:21.690 --> 32:24.170
全部转给了
To maricruz delgado

32:24.180 --> 32:25.400
芝加哥的玛丽克鲁兹·德尔加多
In chicago

32:25.410 --> 32:28.280
那个娇弱的令人怜爱的
At 123 please don't hurt me lane.

32:28.900 --> 32:29.820
我发誓  如果她有什么三长两短...
I swear to god, if something happens to her...

32:29.830 --> 32:31.120
那又怎么样!
If what?!

32:32.940 --> 32:34.810
说呀  王八蛋!
What, jackass?!

32:38.750 --> 32:40.820
你还是老老实实回去
You're going to go back there and you're going to get me

32:40.830 --> 32:42.200
给我弄一些真正的情报
Some real information,

32:42.560 --> 32:46.910
要不然玛丽克鲁兹就会脑袋搬家!
Or Maricruz and her head are going to part ways.

32:49.970 --> 32:51.370
从我的车里滚出去!
Get out of my car.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.250
现在就滚!
Now.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.220
嗨  布兰科
Hey, Blanco.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.170
你的好兄弟勒齐来了
I got your good buddy Lechero here.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.180

Why don't you give it the secret knock so he knows it's you, huh?

33:15.460 --> 33:16.870
密码
The combination.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.550
你怎么会认为我知道密码呢?
What makes you think I have the combination?

33:19.440 --> 33:21.640
乖乖照他说的做  明白吗?
Just do what he says. huh?

33:27.150 --> 33:28.800
你究竟要拿这把小玩意威胁我多少次?
How many times you gonna pull that little thing out?

33:28.810 --> 33:30.220
我想多少次就多少次  只要我觉得有必要
As many times as I feel necessary.

33:30.910 --> 33:32.940
因为它让你觉得你很强大  对吗?
What, you think it make you look strong?

33:33.740 --> 33:35.600
其实虚张声势只会让你显得更加脆弱
All it does is magnify your weakness.

33:38.970 --> 33:40.360
真可笑  现在我感觉很好
Funny, I'm feeling pretty

33:40.370 --> 33:41.870

33:56.710 --> 33:57.640
把家伙放下!

我说把家伙放下!
Drop them, I sai

33:59.760 --> 34:00.860
走!
Now move!

34:10.510 --> 34:11.880
你打算和他一起逃走?
You're escaping with him?

34:12.970 --> 34:14.860
我本来想把一切都告诉你的
I was gonna tell you all about this, bredda.

34:15.570 --> 34:17.120
但你就是没开口  对吗?
It just never camep, eh?

34:25.680 --> 34:27.210

34:28.140 --> 34:29.650
我们可以一起逃走
We can go together.

34:30.420 --> 34:33.100
我会拿走一切
I'm taking everything you t.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.360
不过你哪也别想去
But you ain't going nowhere.

34:40.420 --> 34:42.310
你们打算如何完成这个洞?
How you finishing up this hole?

34:42.530 --> 34:44.460
答应我带惠斯勒一起走
Promise me you'll take Whistler with you.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.020
你在要求我吗?
You making demands on me?

34:49.380 --> 34:50.280
是吗?
Hu

34:50.290 --> 34:51.570
我知道
I understand...

34:52.450 --> 34:53.680
为什么你会杀了我
Why you're going to kill me,

34:53.690 --> 34:55.180
但他没做错什么
But he's done nothing wrong.

34:55.830 --> 34:57.850
我会告诉你你想知道的一切
I'll tell you everything you need to know,

34:58.540 --> 35:00.130
只要你把他带上
Just take him with you.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.100
你需要他

35:02.630 --> 35:04.540
整个计划都是他想出来的
He's the only one who figured this one out.

35:05.410 --> 35:07.820
别担心  我会照顾好你朋友的
Don't you worry, I'll take care of yoriend.

35:10.340 --> 35:11.560
那好
All right.

35:11.730 --> 35:13.460
首先  你们要继续一边前进
First, you need to keep building braces

35:13.470 --> 35:15.220
一边做支撑物支撑隧道
To support the tunnel as you go.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.380
怎么做?
How you do that?

35:16.390 --> 35:17.840
惠斯勒会教你们
Whistler can show you how.

35:18.110 --> 35:19.400
看起来你们
Look like you just

35:19.410 --> 35:21.510
用这些箱子做了些木框

35:23.680 --> 35:25.200
惠斯勒会教你们

35:25.640 --> 35:27.500
离地面还有多远?
How much further to the surface?

35:28.320 --> 35:29.520
很近了
Not far.

35:29.940 --> 35:32.130
不会超过10英尺
Can't be more than ten feet.

35:38.100 --> 35:39.700
真不赖啊  布兰科
Impressive, Blanco.

35:40.160 --> 35:43.230
真遗憾你不能享用它了
Too bad you won't be around to enjoy it.

36:22.740 --> 36:24.150
这样的情况对我们有多大影响?
How long is this going to set us back?

36:24.160 --> 36:26.340
如果警戒塔上的哨兵
What's gonna set us back is if the tower guards are looking at

36:26.350 --> 36:29.140
看见荒地里塌下去一个大洞就糟了
A giant sinkhole out in no man's land.

36:37.970 --> 36:39.120
迈克?
Michael?

36:51.410 --> 36:52.660

For what, getting your ass kicked?

37:33.950 --> 37:36.510
我加入他们  或者到屋顶上把一切都嚷出来
I'm in or I shout it from the rooftops.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.690
你最好也一块加入
You're in, champ.

37:56.290 --> 37:57.760
你要待在这
Okay, you need to stay here.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.270
我要去取点东西
I got to get something, all right?

38:00.280 --> 38:01.400
别走开
Don't move.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.140
从这里你能自己回家吗?
Can you get home from here?

38:22.260 --> 38:23.960
可以  我家就隔了两个街区
Yeah, I'm two blocks away.

39:07.860 --> 39:09.060

39:11.960 --> 39:13.110
你总是要我证明
You know, for all the times you wanted me

39:13.120 --> 39:14.600
自己是个渔夫
To prove I was a fisherman,

39:16.360 --> 39:18.840
其实我也该问问你是否真地是个工程师
I should have been asking if you were a real engineer.

39:20.410 --> 39:22.010
我们两个其中一个本来应该被塌方埋葬的
That could've been one of us buried down there.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.320
下次我会做得更好的
I'll do bett next time.

39:26.850 --> 39:29.290
我下去修整一下那些支撑物
I'm gonna go back down and try to salvage some of those braces.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.630
好  我和你一起去
Yeah, I'll go with you.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.590
这种事总是这么困难的
Never gets any easier.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.210
斯科菲尔德  有人来探视你
Scofield, visita.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.670

我把在索纳三年做小工的钱都攒起来了

40:36.390 --> 40:39.100

If you're really leaving, it's yours.

把我也带上吧
Take me with you.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.960
