00:10.900 --> 00:12.390
之前从未有人从这越过狱
No one's ever broken out of this place before,

00:12.400 --> 00:15.990
更别说只有一周时间来策划
let alone with a week to plan, so you tell these people

00:16.000 --> 00:17.090
你去告诉那帮人 我会尽力助他越狱
I'm gonna break this guy out of here

00:17.100 --> 00:19.000
甚至不惜付出生命的代价
or I'm going to die trying.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.990
我需要你留下做我耳目
You're going to stay on as my ears.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.200
向我汇报所有你听说的消息
You'll report back to me everything you hear

00:24.800 --> 00:26.300
当我不在场的时候
when I'm not around.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.990
我知道你有个哥哥在外面接应你
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,

00:29.000 --> 00:30.590
他跑去找了我女友
I know he ran into my girlfriend,

00:30.600 --> 00:32.590
还知道他从她那儿抢走了我的书
and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.300
他们抢走了的我的宝贝
This is what they took from me.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.800
所以说白了
So let's be clear,

00:36.400 --> 00:38.200
这才是我关心的事情
this is what matters to me.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.900
而不是你
Not you.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.700
更不是你的书
And not your book.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.800
LJ怎样? 莎拉怎样?
How's LJ? How's Sara?

00:46.100 --> 00:47.400
他们说都很好
They told me they're fine.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.400
你还有什么瞒着我?
What are you not telling me?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.290
并非只有你一个牵涉其中
You're not the only one affected

00:53.300 --> 00:55.590
他们杀了莎拉头割下弃在盒中
They killed Sara and put her head in a box

00:55.600 --> 00:57.100
他们还抓走了我的儿子
And they got my son

01:00.500 --> 01:02.900
你没有时间了
you are running out of the time

02:11.600 --> 02:13.200
什么东西
what's that?

02:15.600 --> 02:16.900
一只老鼠
A rat.

J.P盖迪(美首位亿万富翁)有一个成功的口诀
J.P. Getty had a formula for success.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.200
早早起身 好好工作
"Rise early, work hard,

03:28.200 --> 03:29.590
钱包鼓鼓
strike oil."

03:29.600 --> 03:31.900
阿历克斯我只是来喝杯水
Just trying to get a drink of water, Alex.

03:33.900 --> 03:37.090
作为你精湛技艺的虔诚的崇拜者
As a devoted student of your work and skills,

03:37.100 --> 03:38.990
我真的非常期待
I-I really look forward

03:39.000 --> 03:40.690
和你一起共同实施计划 迈克
to progress on your plan, Michael.

03:40.700 --> 03:43.100
我期待你能别老缠着我
I'm looking forward to you getting off my back.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.100
臭小子 欢迎你来索纳监狱
Buenos, welcome to Sona.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.000
那是你的皮夹子吗?
Is that your wallet?

04:00.700 --> 04:02.000
该死的皮夹子
Dame tu billetera.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.300
抱歉 我不懂西班牙语
No hablo Espal, uh?

04:07.200 --> 04:08.800
你明白我说的意思
You know what I said.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.600
不明白
No.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.800
你不该这么回答的
That's the wrong answer.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.100
只要你搞定了 我随时可以跟你出去
I am so ready to get out of here anytime you are.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.000
斯科菲尔德有访客
Scofield,visita.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.300
斯科菲尔德有访客
scofield, you have a visitor.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.700
长夜漫漫啊
You look like you had a long night.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.600
没错
Yeah.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.400
我花了很久喂老鼠吃巧克力
I spent most of it feeding chocolate to a rat.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.100
这几天都没有整块时间可以开工的
I don't have a whole lot to work with these days.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.000
她拿走了那本书 鸟类导读
She's got the book, man, the bird guide.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.000
她发现了
She worked it out.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.600
那我们手上没有筹码了
So we have no leverage.

04:58.900 --> 04:59.790
-没了 -告诉我
-No. -Tell me

04:59.800 --> 05:02.390
当你递上那本书的时候
When you were handing over the book,

05:02.400 --> 05:05.290
你有没有要LJ和莎拉的最新照片
did you ask for a recent photo of LJ and Sara?

05:05.300 --> 05:06.100
是的
Yeah.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.100
那照片呢?
And where is it?

05:08.400 --> 05:10.490
她给我看了照片 但是不肯给我
She showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.490
老弟 我可没有资格和他们谈条件
Man, I'm not in a position to bargain with these people.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.800
我是说他们已经被激怒了
I mean, they're pissed.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.300
明天就得越狱出来
You break out tomorrow.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.890
让我们只关注越狱一事吧
Let's just focus on that.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.200
回到正题上来
Let's keep on track.

05:19.700 --> 05:20.500
好吧
All right.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.190
当我在狱内开工的时候
While I'm working from the inside,

05:24.200 --> 05:25.590
我需要你去准备下
I need you to take care of what happens

05:25.600 --> 05:26.890
逃出来后的事宜
once we're outside.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.190
需要辆车逃之夭夭
We're going to need a getaway vehicle,

05:28.200 --> 05:30.100
不惹眼的那种
something inconspicuous.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.390
不管你找到什么车 明天下午3点
Whatever you find, it has to be parked

05:31.400 --> 05:33.590
必须停在离这半英里的地方
a half mile from here by 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

05:33.600 --> 05:33.790
你是说凌晨3点?
You mean a.m.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.500
不 确实是下午
No, I mean p.m.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.900
林肯 我们没得选
We don't have a choice, Linc.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.990
昨晚上我做了些测试
I ran some tests last night.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.400
军方吉普车夜晚在周边巡逻
Military jeeps patrol the perimeter at night.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.000
晚上根本无法分辨他们在什么方位
There's no way of telling where they're going to be in the dark.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.900
整晚上他们都在外面巡逻
They were out there all night.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.900
我们需要夜幕遮掩 不能就
We need the dark, we can't just Just

05:51.300 --> 05:52.200
拜托别争了
Please.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.600
因为明天就要动手了
Because we're doing this tomorrow.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.800
中午时分行动
In the middle of the day.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.000
你看谁呢?
Who're you looking at?

06:24.700 --> 06:25.900
那家伙
That guy.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.100
我认识他
I know him.

07:10.850 --> 07:13.240
小麦迪朋友 我需要块手表
McGrady, my friend, I'm going to need a watch.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.450
或许要2块
Maybe two.

07:14.950 --> 07:16.450
我不会问其中原因了
I'm not even going to ask why.

07:17.850 --> 07:20.650
我还需要些双筒望远镜
I'm also going to need some binoculars.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.750
老威廉倒是有个
Old Guillermo has a pair.

07:24.350 --> 07:26.250
他根本不可能卖给你
There's no way he'll sell them to you, man.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.840
但是望远镜也不算难搞定
But they shouldn't be hard to get.

07:27.850 --> 07:29.450
我上哪里能找到他?
Where can I find this guy?

07:51.350 --> 07:52.850
我们明天行动
We leave tomorrow.

07:58.350 --> 07:59.450
这个
This

08:04.950 --> 08:06.750
这是我们逃离索纳监狱的方案
This is how we're getting out of Sona.

08:06.850 --> 08:08.440
逃出监狱隔栏
Getting out of the cell block

08:08.450 --> 08:09.240
应该不是什么问题
shouldn't be a problem.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.050
围壁栅栏很容易突破
The grate and bars are weak,

08:11.150 --> 08:12.140
但是我们需要些绳索
but we're going to need some kind of rope,

08:12.150 --> 08:14.750
还有梯子 这样可以从另外边下去
some kind of ladder, to let us down on the other side.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.440
那就是我标出最安全的线路
That's why I figured out the safest

08:16.450 --> 08:18.350
从这里到栅栏的那个洞的原因
line from here to the hole in the fence.

08:18.450 --> 08:19.850
我们白天动手
We do it in the day,

08:19.850 --> 08:22.350
只有塔楼上的2个警卫能看到我们
we'll only be visible to the two guard towers.

08:22.550 --> 08:24.450
周边警卫的情况很难说
The perimeter guards are less predictable,

08:24.950 --> 08:26.240
但是他们只有在晚上才出没
but they're only on at night.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.340
大白天的穿越监狱逃跑?
Scurrying across the field in the middle of the day?

08:28.350 --> 08:29.350
这是唯一避开巡逻吉普车的方法
It's the only way to avoid the jeep patrol.

08:30.650 --> 08:33.350
明天下午2点 监狱大院里会有场球赛
Now, in the yard tomorrow, there's a soccer game at 2:00.

08:33.350 --> 08:35.640
应该会吸引狱内很多注意力
That should prove some distraction inside.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.240
昨天我们在挖洞的时候
And yesterday when we were digging,

08:37.250 --> 08:39.340
我看到太阳光照射到这个家伙
I saw the glare from the sun hit this guy

08:39.350 --> 08:40.850
在晌午时分
in the late afternoon.

08:41.150 --> 08:42.540
看上去他就会转身
Looked like he turned away,

08:42.550 --> 08:44.250
好似视线受阻似的
like maybe his vision was blocked.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.550
这样还不足以越狱
It's not much of a break.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.640
不 但这是唯一的方法
No, but it is

08:47.650 --> 08:49.750
我们必须这么去做
one way to do what we need to do.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.240
还有个警卫
As far as thisther guard,

08:51.250 --> 08:53.150
必须找出他的弱点
his weakness has yet to be termined.

08:57.350 --> 09:00.050
如果我们要和这帮警卫周旋
If we're going to get around these guys,

09:00.550 --> 09:02.150
就必须得了解他们
we've got to get to know them.

09:04.850 --> 09:06.550
这可没这么简单
It's not going to be easy.

09:06.950 --> 09:08.540
只有一条正真意义上的路通往监狱
There's only one real road that goes to the prison.

09:08.550 --> 09:10.950
我们不走大路 不用考虑了
We don't want a real road that's not an option.

09:17.550 --> 09:18.650
怎么了?
What?

09:18.850 --> 09:20.550
留给你兄弟的时间所剩无几
Your brother's cutting it close.

09:21.250 --> 09:21.840
你说一周的
You said a week.

09:21.850 --> 09:23.840
明天就周三了 可没空闲犯错了
Tomorrow's Wednesday, you didn't leave much room for error.

09:23.850 --> 09:25.550
根本不会犯什么错
There's not going to be an"error."

09:25.850 --> 09:27.340
听着 我有一堆事要处理 还要
Listen, I've got a lot of stuff to do and I just

09:27.350 --> 09:29.340
那就是为何我不会浪费你的时间
Which is why I won't waste your time.

09:29.350 --> 09:30.940
当惠斯勒出来后 我需要
When Whistler's free, I need to get to him

09:30.950 --> 09:31.640
立刻见到他
as soon as possible.

09:31.650 --> 09:33.040
我还在为他们逃出栅栏后
I'm still trying to work out what's going

09:33.050 --> 09:34.850
可能发生的事情忙活着
to happen once they get past the fence.

09:35.150 --> 09:37.540
一旦我知道所有细节 我会让你
Once I know all the details, I'll let you

09:37.550 --> 09:38.440
林肯 冷静
Lincoln, calm down.

09:38.450 --> 09:39.640
你让我觉得
It sounds to me like you

09:39.650 --> 09:41.350
你们两兄弟似乎有点焦头烂额
and your brother are in over your heads.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.950
莎拉的事 很抱歉
There's a bad joke about Sara somewhere in there.

09:45.450 --> 09:46.750
听着
Listen

09:48.050 --> 09:49.840
我会把详情都告诉你的
I'll let you know all the details

09:49.850 --> 09:51.850
我一知道就会打电话给你
once I know them, and then I'll call you.

09:52.750 --> 09:55.150
我和你们一样 希望这事能解决
I want this to work out just as badly as you do.

09:55.150 --> 09:56.550
你比我们还急 我知道
MoreI'm sure.

09:58.150 --> 09:58.950
LJ 呢?
LJ?

09:59.250 --> 10:01.450
LJ 很好 你还有34个小时
LJ's fine. You have 34 hours.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.150
她说什么了?
What did she say?

10:06.350 --> 10:07.840
都是些废话
Nothing we don't already know.

10:07.850 --> 10:09.750
走吧 有好多事要做呢
Let's get out of here; we got a lot of stuff to do.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.250
瑞弗拉先生么?
Seir Rivera?

10:22.350 --> 10:23.550
谁?
Who?

10:23.750 --> 10:26.750
你是约格·瑞弗拉对吗?
You're Jorge Rivera, right?

10:26.750 --> 10:28.750
索纳监狱的挖墓人?
Gravedigger at Sona?

10:29.150 --> 10:30.340
什么事?
so?

10:30.350 --> 10:32.250
要搭便车吗?
Would you like a ride?

10:33.450 --> 10:36.050
不 不 有人马上来接我
No no, someone's coming to get me in a little bit.

10:39.050 --> 10:42.450
我和你前任有个计划
I had an arrangement with your predecessor.

10:43.850 --> 10:48.340
我想让你把这个带进监狱
I need you to get this inside the prison.

10:48.350 --> 10:50.450
我不进监狱的
I don't go inside the prison.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.150
他也进不去
Neither did he.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.850
那这样吧?
How about this?

10:53.950 --> 10:55.240
你想办法把这个
You find a way to get this delivery

10:55.250 --> 10:55.940
送进监狱
inside the prison

10:55.950 --> 10:57.740
只要一次就好
just this one time.

10:57.750 --> 10:58.850
干吗要这么做?
Why would I?

10:59.050 --> 11:00.940
因为我会给你
Becuase I would give you

11:00.950 --> 11:02.650
5000美金
five thousand dollars.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.140
5000美金?
Five thousand dollars?

11:08.150 --> 11:09.750
就一次?
For just one time?

11:09.850 --> 11:11.750
难道你不想干?
Couldn't you do that?

11:12.150 --> 11:14.150
我想你能办到的
I think you could do it.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.450
这样行吗?
In this?

11:17.250 --> 11:18.650
你疯了
You're crazy

11:18.850 --> 11:21.550
只有你可以做到
Only you can do it.

11:46.050 --> 11:47.850
我不会让他们知道的
I wouldn't let 'em see you do that.

11:50.350 --> 11:50.840
谁?
Who?

11:50.850 --> 11:52.740
任何人 这是用来喝的
Anyone. It's a drinking fountain.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.140
他们直接用嘴喝的
They put their lips right on there.

11:54.150 --> 11:56.050
你会感觉就像美酒那样
You'd think it spits straight Jack Daniels.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.750
知道怎么回事吗?
You understand what happened, don't you?

11:59.850 --> 12:02.250
你就是 这里所谓的 贱民
You're a what's-it-called? a pariah.

12:03.450 --> 12:04.840
我当初来时也犯了同样的错误
I made the same mistake when I walked in here

12:04.850 --> 12:06.040
想要保住我的钱包
tried to hang on to my wallet.

12:06.050 --> 12:08.640
接下来那两天 我可够惨的
Next thing I knew, I spent the next two days kneecap deep

12:08.650 --> 12:10.350
众目睽睽之下下跪
in human feces.

12:11.450 --> 12:12.840
在索纳 人人为己
In Sona, it's every man for himself.

12:12.850 --> 12:15.050
来吧 蛋糕
Here, cheese.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.150
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

12:17.350 --> 12:18.750
会饿的
Yeah, you will be.

12:20.750 --> 12:22.350
我看到了别的美国人
I saw the other Americans.

12:22.550 --> 12:24.440
你们没人打过电话给大使馆 是吧?
So none of you have called the embassy, huh?

12:24.450 --> 12:26.340
我们这些外国佬并不都是蠢蛋
Us gringos ain't all butt buddies.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.050

16:31.250 --> 16:33.950
这家伙以为一切尽在掌握
This guy thinks he's auditioning for Buckingham Palace.

16:34.550 --> 16:35.950

然后他就得调整天线
He had to turn to adjust the antennae.

16:44.450 --> 16:45.950

That's nothing we can count on.

16:46.450 --> 16:47.350

I don't see why they keep me alive.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.280
就像你说的 你有他们要的东西
It's like you said you've got something they want.

24:04.220 --> 24:06.630
我告诉他们的话 我就没利用价值了
Once I give it to them, I'll be no use to them.

24:06.860 --> 24:07.830
对吗?
Right?

24:07.840 --> 24:09.800
我什么都不知道
I don't have all the answers.

24:09.890 --> 24:12.350
我只知道我要把你弄出去
All I know is it's my job to get you out of here.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.090
走吧
Let's go.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.610
这是周三的两剂毒品 我特意给你留的
It's twofer Tuesday, my one-time special just for you.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.000
但是不能白给你
But there's a price.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.910
勒齐对流动资金很敏感
Lechero's getting pret sensitive about the cash flow.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.750
我现在手头紧
Well, I'm a little short right now.

24:44.430 --> 24:45.360
别担心 阿历克斯
No worries, Alex.

24:45.370 --> 24:48.090
我不会让你为难的 好吗?
I am not gonna leave you hanging, all right?

24:48.860 --> 24:50.960
我们可以给你赊账
We can just start you a tab.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.120
他看到我们了吗?
Think he saw us?

25:24.130 --> 25:26.030
猜猜我们能找到什么
Guess we'll find out.

26:31.330 --> 26:33.090
我大三的时候
My third year in school,

26:33.090 --> 26:36.250
我学的是电力工程EMP专业
we studied electrical engineering with a focus on EMPs.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.760
EMP就是电磁脉冲的意思
That's electromagnetic pulses.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.460
如果你把能量源放到发射器上
If you hook up a pow source to a transmitter,

26:41.470 --> 26:43.330
就能发射电磁脉冲
it generates a pulse.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.950
脉冲会干扰所有的电子设备
That pulse crashes anything electronic.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.800
那是什么 就像简介
What's that, like an intro

26:47.810 --> 26:49.860
反恐战略的简介?
an intro into anti-terrorist tactics?

26:49.870 --> 26:51.250
差不多吧 这些天
Basically. These days,

26:51.260 --> 26:53.040
他们教学生
they have to teach students how to defend

26:53.050 --> 26:54.700
如何保护他们的结构
their structures.

26:54.860 --> 26:57.230
幸运的是 那个监视塔
Fortunately for us, that guard tower is

26:57.240 --> 26:59.380
已经造好很久了
It was engineered a long time ago.

26:59.830 --> 27:02.700
我猜你是基础科学的常胜将军
I'm guessing you always won the elementary science fair.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.380
把这个插上去
Plug this in.

27:28.770 --> 27:30.290
电视信号受干扰了吗?
Did it crash the telly?

27:31.110 --> 27:32.980
我们隔得太远了
We're too far away.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.710
但是起作用了 正如我们需要的那样
But it is doing exactly what we need it to.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.240
没事
Okay.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.030
-快出来 -为什么?
Get out Why?

27:58.040 --> 27:59.560
他们冲进来了
They're coming in.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.610
马上离开这
Ahora mismo.

28:04.820 --> 28:07.770
呆在这 别让人发现她
Stay here. Do not let them see her.

28:07.780 --> 28:09.200
千万别被发现
Do not

28:40.550 --> 28:41.930
上校
Colonel.

28:42.970 --> 28:44.930
我们没有收到通知啊
We received no word of this

28:45.070 --> 28:47.620
塔楼上发现了狙击枪瞄准镜
A rifle scope waseen from the tower.

28:47.690 --> 28:49.610
胡塔多队长亲眼所见的
Capitan Hurtado saw it with his own eyes.

28:49.620 --> 28:51.410
根本不可能
That's impossible.

28:51.820 --> 28:53.820
狱中有把枪
There is a gun in your prison,

28:53.830 --> 28:56.380
而且瞄准着我的人
and it was pointing at one of my men.

28:56.390 --> 28:57.990
我们会找出来的
We are going to find it.

29:18.780 --> 29:19.900
这看上去很不错
This looks good.

29:19.910 --> 29:20.480
怎么说?
For what?

29:20.490 --> 29:21.870
坐下
Have a seat.

29:22.030 --> 29:22.660
我在这边应该
What am I supposed

29:22.670 --> 29:23.960
干些什么呢?
to doing here?

29:23.970 --> 29:25.600
表现的你很享受就行
Look like you're having fun.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.310
你最后一次见到你儿子是什么时候?
When was the last time you saw your son?

29:38.060 --> 29:38.680
林肯 你该知道的
You know, Lincoln,

29:38.690 --> 29:40.380
我不会轻信别人
I don't automatically trust people either,

29:40.390 --> 29:43.160
但至少我能分辨他们是否出于善意
but at least I can tell when they have good intentions.

29:43.170 --> 29:44.680
能这样不错
Good for you.

29:47.030 --> 29:49.580
我不会再来证明自己的立场
You know, I'm not gonna try to prove myself anymore.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.980
我们互不相干 各忙各的
You do your job, and I'll do mine.

30:05.110 --> 30:06.210
你需要什么?
You need something?

30:06.220 --> 30:08.140
-你说什么? -你需要什么?
What? You need something?

30:10.780 --> 30:11.550
不需要
No.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.960
很好
Good.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.010
别担心 会没事的
Don't you worry. It's all gonna be okay.

30:35.020 --> 30:37.290
-会有麻烦的 -我向你保证
No, it's not. I promise you, I will not let

30:37.300 --> 30:38.410
我不会让任何人发现你在这里
anyone find you in here.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.490
勒齐一定恨死我了
Oh Lechero hate me.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.480
勒齐不会恨你
Lechero does not hate you.

30:41.490 --> 30:44.070
你在他心目中地位特殊
You hold a very special place in his heart.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.820
有这么多的女孩可以取代我
So many girls can take my place.

30:45.830 --> 30:47.920
不 他很明白 知道你比他们都好
No, he's smart. He knows you're better than them.

30:47.930 --> 30:49.190
你是个真女子
You're a real woman.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.710
有自己意志 自己追求的女子
A woman of her own will, her own desire.

30:52.390 --> 30:53.670
你知道我是怎样的人
You know what I am.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.630
妹子 这个世界上我们都是出卖自身的人
In this world, sister, we are all prostitutes.

30:56.640 --> 30:59.010
你是女皇
You are a queen.

31:53.600 --> 31:54.790
这是谁的狱室?
Whose cell is that?

31:54.800 --> 31:56.220
在角上的那个?
In the corner?

32:00.130 --> 32:01.690
是你的狱室吗?
Is that your cell?

32:11.420 --> 32:12.210
你

32:29.420 --> 32:30.920

It's not a weapon.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.720
我知道这是什么

32:42.420 --> 32:44.020

33:01.000 --> 33:04.400
我只再问你一遍
i want to ask you one more time.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.800
你为什么要监视我
Why were you watching me?

33:07.500 --> 33:09.800
-我没有监视你 -我看见你了
I wasn't watching you I saw you.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.190
回答我
Answer the question

33:12.200 --> 33:14.700
我不知道你看到了什么 不过我真的没有监视你
I don't know what you think you saw but i wasn't watching you.

33:17.200 --> 33:17.890
撒谎

33:17.900 --> 33:19.800
我真的没有监视你

33:24.500 --> 33:26.600

It's mine.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.000
你为什么监视他?
Why were you watching him?

33:36.500 --> 33:38.800

I was scared.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.200

34:23.000 --> 34:24.600

34:24.900 --> 34:28.500
胡塔多 我们走

35:33.100 --> 35:34.500

Now, don't worry.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.300

35:55.900 --> 35:57.200

巡逻队来过 不过他们没有久留
A patrol passed through, but they didn't stay.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.090
乱搜了一通 然后走了
Knock some things over then walked away.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.790
我当时让她躲在一个安全的地方
I hid your woman in a safe place,

36:08.800 --> 36:10.390
不过说老实话
but I'd be lying

36:10.400 --> 36:12.190
当时可真够险的
if I didn't say it was a close call.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.400
她现在一个人待着?
Is she alone?

36:13.500 --> 36:14.800
是的
Yeah.

36:21.700 --> 36:22.900
你好啊

36:28.800 --> 36:29.900
他们走了
They're gone.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.500

Patr,

36:41.400 --> 36:43.500
钱是我给她的
I gave her the money.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.590
我先把钱给她
I was going to replace it myself

36:46.600 --> 36:48.090
月底时候拿我的那份补上
at the end of the day, when I get my cut.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.490
我只是一直没机会跟你汇报这事
I just didn't get a chance to tell you.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.090
她根本没钱回家
She had no money to get home.

36:51.100 --> 36:52.300
是这样吗?
Is this true?

36:53.600 --> 36:54.700
是的
Yes.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.200
我这么说没有一点不敬的意思
With all due respect.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.990
你一定不愿让你情人一分钱不带就上路的
Surely you don't want your mistress travelin' broke.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.890
不然的话 她就算打到车
She'd end up in a taxi

37:01.900 --> 37:04.100
也没钱付打的费啊
with no way to pay the cab fare.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.300
啊 你这么做
Ah, you did this?

37:07.900 --> 37:08.690
是为了帮我的忙啊
For me?

37:15.500 --> 37:18.100

你是真心实意的替我着想了
And now you do the thinking for me.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.400
也不能都这么说 老大
No, no, it's not like that, patr

37:30.100 --> 37:31.400
去拿水桶
Get the bucket.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.600
来给我洗脚
Wash my feet.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.500
我们现在该怎么办
So what do we do now?

37:46.300 --> 37:47.700
我不知道
I don't know.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.790
这个回答可不怎么样
Well, I'm afraid that's not good enough.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.790
得了 给我点时间考虑一下
Please just give me a moment to think.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.490
我可不能在这里耗下去了 迈克
Wasting time is not an option for me, Michael.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.690

那是我的航海日志 我告诉过你
That's my trip log, I've told you.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.590
我必须按图索骥
I need to retrace my steps.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.790
我只能按照他们吩咐的去做 你不也是嘛
I'm doing everything they tell me, the same thing you are.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.900
你让我一个人待会行不 求你了
just, just leave me alone, please.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.400
告诉你 我被抓起来之前
You know, before I was arrested,

38:10.400 --> 38:12.800
一个人闯进我的公寓 拿走了我的通讯录
a man came to my flat and took my addresses.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.090
他们知道我所在意的每个人的名字
They know the name of everyone I care about

38:15.100 --> 38:16.600
以及如何找到他们
and how to find them.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.400
事实上他们已经找了我所在意的每个人
Well, they already found everyone I care out. Okay?

38:22.700 --> 38:25.100
如果你不能把我弄出去 现在就告诉我
If you can't get me out of here, tell me now.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.900
我没有时间了
because time is running out.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.100
明白吗?
Huh?

38:47.600 --> 38:49.100
真是个大热天
Look, it's hot today.

38:50.300 --> 38:51.600
是的
Yeah.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.200
和冷天相比还是每天热点好
Prefer the heat than the cold any day.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.390
你知道我和我兄弟准备离开这
You know my brother and I wanted to come

38:57.400 --> 38:58.900
流亡巴拿马

38:59.400 --> 39:02.000
开家冲浪店就像我们今天去过的那家

我儿子 他应该离开学校来帮我们
My boy, he was gonna leave school and help us

39:04.700 --> 39:06.300
打理家族生意

39:07.500 --> 39:09.700

When this is all over, why don't you do it?

39:12.100 --> 39:13.800
发生了很多糟糕的事
Too much bad stuff's happened.

39:14.900 --> 39:16.800
你向来都可以搞定的
Still, you can make it work.

39:16.900 --> 39:20.090
一切都可以搞定 如果惠斯勒合作的话
It's only gonna work if if Whistler cooperates.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.100
他玩花样 就会害了别人
he plays games, people get hurt.

39:23.300 --> 39:24.800
你懂我的意思吗?
You understa that, right?

39:25.700 --> 39:27.500
他并不希望任何人受伤

39:29.700 --> 39:30.900

39:31.100 --> 39:32.700
我想给你看点东西

39:42.100 --> 39:43.700
我们的逃亡工具
Our getaway vehicle.

39:45.400 --> 39:46.390

39:46.400 --> 39:48.700
