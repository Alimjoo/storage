WEBVTT

00:06.300 --> 00:07.130
挖通了
I'm through.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.900
我们另一头见
See you on the other side.

00:12.860 --> 00:14.500
这样不行
It can't be done.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.200
我们出不去了
We're not getting out of here.

00:16.260 --> 00:19.260
只有一个人能够终止这次行刑
There's only one person who can really stop this execution.

00:19.330 --> 00:21.760
你能和你爸爸谈谈吗... 为了我?
Would you talk to your father for me?

00:21.830 --> 00:24.960
我爸爸最不听的就是我的话了
I'm the last person in the world that my father listens to.

00:25.030 --> 00:28.700
州长回顾了整个案子
The Governor has reviewed your case.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.400
不能把你赦免
He's not granting clemency.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.000
开始吧
Let's proceed.

00:32.060 --> 00:35.160
我独自一个人来到这世界上  请赐予我勇气
I came in here a man. Give me the strength

00:35.230 --> 00:37.200
让我独自离开
to walk out of here a man.

02:01.530 --> 02:03.460
医生...
Doctor,

02:03.530 --> 02:05.030
你可以离开了
you can leave now.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.500
是他
It's him.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.900
迈克尔
Michael.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.360
他说什么?
What's he saying?

02:27.430 --> 02:29.930
迈克尔 转过头去...
Michael, turn around.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.930
-是他  -你知道他说什么了?
-It's him.  -What do you think he's saying?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.960
迈克尔...
Michael,

02:35.030 --> 02:36.260
转身看看
turn around.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.100
怎么了?
What's going on?

03:05.160 --> 03:07.730
我不知道
I don't know.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.860
发生了什么?
What's happening?

03:11.930 --> 03:14.630
到底发生了什么?
What the hell's going on in there?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.060
对你们所遭受的一切
I can't tell you how sorry I am

03:50.130 --> 03:51.600
我感到十分抱歉
that you've had to go through all of this.

03:58.730 --> 04:00.560
林肯...
Lincoln.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.030
发生了什么事?
What happened in there?

04:09.100 --> 04:10.930
柯尔斯法官打来电话
Judge Kessler called.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.830
行刑要延期
The execution's been delayed.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.700
"延期"?什么意思?
What do you mean delayed?

04:14.760 --> 04:16.000
很明显 找到些新的证据
Apparently, some new evidence has come to light.

04:16.060 --> 04:17.830
-什么证据?  -我不明白
-What evidence?  -I don't understand.

04:17.900 --> 04:19.830
我们还有多少时间?  一天 两天?
How long do we have? One day, two days?

04:19.900 --> 04:22.630
我目前也只知道这些
That's all the information I have at the moment.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.760
抱歉
I'm sorry.

04:24.830 --> 04:27.900
你们可以再呆一会儿
I'll give you a minute.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.130
你没事吧?
You okay?

04:31.330 --> 04:33.600
我得去搞清楚还有多少时间
I need to know how much time we have.

04:33.660 --> 04:36.230
我去找法官问问清楚
I'll go and see the judge and find out.

04:39.460 --> 04:41.560
你和迈克尔在一起  会没事的
You're with Michael. You'll be okay.

04:44.060 --> 04:45.830
你看到他了?  谁?
-Did you see him?  -Who?

04:45.900 --> 04:47.500
观刑事的那个人
The guy in the viewing room.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.330
没有
No.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.900
是爸爸
It was Dad.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.960
是爸爸
It was Dad.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.000
是他 我知道是的
It was him. I know it was.

05:35.070 --> 05:37.030
这不可能 林肯
That's not possible, Linc.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.970
我看到他了
It is possible. I saw him.

05:39.030 --> 05:40.900
我不知道你怎么看到的
I don't know how you could have.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.600
房间里只有6个人
There were only half a dozen people in that room.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.100
我 维罗妮卡 还有几个记者
Me, Veronica and a bunch of reporters.

05:48.170 --> 05:49.930
他不在那儿
He wasn't there.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.100
你并不知道
You don't know that.

05:51.170 --> 05:53.630
我知道 否则我会认出他来
I do. I would have recognized him.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.470
你不记得他长什么样  而我记得
You don't remember what he looks like. I do.

05:55.530 --> 05:59.430
他什么时候离开我们的 30年前?
This is a man who took off, what, 30 years ago?

05:59.500 --> 06:02.130
他干吗要回来
Why would he come back now,

06:02.200 --> 06:04.270
在你行刑的最后一分钟?
at the very last minute?

06:06.100 --> 06:08.400
我不知道
I don't know.

06:08.470 --> 06:10.530
他怎么还活着?
Why is he still alive?

06:10.600 --> 06:13.070
好像法官得到了一些
It appears that some information

06:13.130 --> 06:15.130
匿名的信息
was anonymously slipped to the judge.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.570
匿名的?
Anonymously?

06:16.630 --> 06:19.170
是你那个又胖又矮的朋友哈尔
It was your fat little friend, Hale.

06:19.230 --> 06:21.000
如果你能早点把他解决
Lf you had taken care of him sooner...

06:21.070 --> 06:22.130
不是哈尔干的
It wasn't Hale.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.330
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

06:23.400 --> 06:26.450
如果哈尔给过维罗妮卡·多诺万能够制止行刑的消息的话
If Hale had given Veronica Donovan anything that could havegotten a stay of execution

06:26.450 --> 06:29.500
早就会在法庭上拿出来了
I think she would have brought it up

06:29.570 --> 06:31.600
而不是一味的争吵
when she made her argument in court.

06:31.670 --> 06:32.770
不是他干的
It didn't come from him.

06:32.830 --> 06:33.900
好吧 你怎么确定?
Well, who else on your end knows?

06:33.970 --> 06:35.500
那你怎么确定?
Who else on your end knows?

06:35.570 --> 06:36.800
干吗都把矛头指向我?
Why all the finger-pointing at us?

06:36.870 --> 06:38.600
你确定消息不是从你那端漏出来的?
Are you sure that the leak didn't come from your end?

06:38.670 --> 06:40.130
从你的公司?
From the company?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.230
嘿 我们都是一条船上的人 不记得了?
Hey, we are all on the same team, remember?

06:44.130 --> 06:45.230
当然记得
Absolutely.

06:46.530 --> 06:48.370
去找出漏洞...
Just find the leak

06:49.630 --> 06:51.400
补好它
and plug it.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.800
谢谢 夫人
Thank you, ma'am.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.300
还有件事 
One more thing.

07:00.370 --> 07:04.170
下次你在我办公室
The next time you're in my office,

07:04.230 --> 07:07.500
我希望你站着跟我讲话
I expect you to stand when you're addressing me.

07:07.570 --> 07:10.170
当然
Absolutely.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.770
我所能说的是...
All I can tell is

07:16.830 --> 07:19.030
我工作的很晚
I was working late in chambers,

07:19.100 --> 07:21.730
在11:00离开  然后看到了..
I left at 11:00, and there it was,

07:21.800 --> 07:24.570
门底下有这东西
right under my door.

07:24.630 --> 07:26.670
一份是特伦斯·斯蒂德曼的尸检报告
One is Terrence Steadman's autopsy report.

07:26.730 --> 07:30.300
在这份报告里  清清楚楚记载着死者身上是有阑尾的
In it, his appendix is noted as present and unremarkable.

07:30.370 --> 07:31.870
而在另一份报告里
The other paper is an operative report

07:31.930 --> 07:33.400
记载着斯蒂德曼先生12岁时 
an operative report

07:33.470 --> 07:35.200
的一次手术报告
from when Mr. Steadman was 12 years old.

07:35.270 --> 07:37.500
是阑尾切除手术报告
The procedure was an appendectomy.

07:39.470 --> 07:41.400
不可能  我看看
That's impossible. Let me see this.

07:41.470 --> 07:43.970
我要求撤消对林肯的定罪
I want the conviction overturned

07:44.030 --> 07:45.230
并马上无罪释放
and Lincoln Burrows immediately released from custody.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.030
还没这么快
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.500
这些报告还没被证实
These records haven't even been certified.

07:48.570 --> 07:50.030
医院可以告诉你
The hospital can tell you.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.300
医院不会保存那么久之前的纪录
The hospital does not keep records going back that far.

07:52.370 --> 07:53.470
我查过了
I checked.

07:53.530 --> 07:55.700
所以就我们目前所知道的
So as far as we know,

07:55.770 --> 07:58.170
这份报告可能是哪个反对死刑的拥护者的恶作
these documents could be a hoax from some anti-death penalty advocate

07:58.230 --> 08:00.230
或者 冒昧的说 反对方的人
or, dare I say it, defense counsel.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.630
你少来  太荒谬了
Oh, please. You're preposterous.

08:01.700 --> 08:02.830
让我们都
Let's just all

08:02.900 --> 08:04.200
冷静一下 好吗?
take a deep breath here, okay?

08:04.270 --> 08:06.270
我不知道这些文件什么意思
I don't know what these papers mean

08:06.330 --> 08:09.000
为谨慎起见  我还需查明事实
and for that reason, I'd like to err on the side of caution.

08:09.070 --> 08:11.770
因此行刑日将延后两个星期
I'm going to delay the execution for two weeks.

08:11.830 --> 08:14.100
我们将会有足够的时间
That should give us more than enough time

08:14.170 --> 08:15.330
检验尸体
to exhume the body.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.100
检验尸体
Exhume the body.

08:17.170 --> 08:19.770
法官大人  恕我直言
Your Honor, all due respect,

08:19.830 --> 08:21.100
这是一个很极端的方法
that is a drastic measure.

08:21.170 --> 08:22.670
这是唯一的方式
It's also the only way we're going to know

08:22.730 --> 08:24.800
让我们知道 埋在地下的
if that body in the ground

08:24.870 --> 08:25.870
是不是特伦斯·斯蒂德曼
is really Terrence Steadman.

08:32.100 --> 08:35.730
就是说被埋葬的不是斯蒂德曼?
So that's not Steadman that was buried?

08:35.800 --> 08:37.470
我们还不知道
We don't know.

08:37.530 --> 08:39.800
如果不是的话  林肯就自由了
If it isn't, Lincoln's free.

08:39.870 --> 08:43.530
如果是的话 一切都得照旧  照顾好你自己 迈克尔
If it is, we're right back where we started.Take care of yourself, Michael.

08:47.170 --> 08:49.070
那具尸体 
So, that body,

08:49.130 --> 08:50.830
如果真是他本人怎么办?
what if it's him?

08:50.900 --> 08:52.700
我不会坐着傻等
Well, I'm not going to sit around hoping.

08:52.770 --> 08:55.700
什么意思?
What does that mean?

08:55.770 --> 08:58.370
意思是我们得回去继续工作
It means we get back to work.

08:58.430 --> 09:01.630
老天 我早希望你这样说了
God, I was hoping you would say that.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.400
他们在掘尸体?
They're digging up the body, huh?

09:03.470 --> 09:05.530
老实说
To be honest,

09:05.600 --> 09:08.700
我从没有碰到过这种情况
I've never been in a situation like this before.

09:08.770 --> 09:11.970
如果还是不能改变的话  你也应该感到欣慰
If nothing else, you can be glad

09:12.030 --> 09:15.230
有那么多人想尽办法要把你救出去
that you've got people who'll go to extreme lengths to get you out of here.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.700
确实如此
No kidding.

09:20.370 --> 09:21.400
监狱长
Warden,

09:23.530 --> 09:25.870
行刑时
at the execution,

09:25.930 --> 09:29.030
观刑室有个人
there was a man in the viewing room.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.830
我在想 你有没有
Just wondering if you

09:30.900 --> 09:32.770
或者其他人有跟他说过话
or anyone in the prison had spoken to him.

09:32.830 --> 09:36.800
恩... 根据这个纪录
Well, according to this,

09:36.870 --> 09:39.900
恩... 在场的人有你弟弟
those present were your brother,

09:39.970 --> 09:41.500
律师 以及三个记者
his attorney and three reporters,

09:41.570 --> 09:43.700
两女一男
two women and a man.

09:43.770 --> 09:45.030
那个男的
The man,

09:45.100 --> 09:46.830
是谁?
who was he?

09:46.900 --> 09:50.100
恩... 他是头条报社的
He was from The Headline Press.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.700
维·珀尔
William Prall.

09:51.770 --> 09:53.530
你认识他?
You know him?

09:53.600 --> 09:56.600
不
No.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.700
警卫
Guard.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.600
请拿稳一点
Hold it steady, please.

10:16.670 --> 10:19.200
你到底在找什么?
What exactly are you looking for in all that ink?

10:19.270 --> 10:21.430
找出去的路
A new way out of here.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.100
你现在还不清楚所有的计划?
You don't know those plans by now?

10:23.170 --> 10:24.770
不
No.

10:24.830 --> 10:28.170
记它就好比记电话本
Memorizing it would be like memorizing the phone book.

10:28.230 --> 10:30.430
是吗 为什么不走66号线?
Yeah, but why not just tat up Route 66?

10:30.500 --> 10:34.000
意外发现
Contingencies.

10:34.070 --> 10:36.230
意外发现?!
Contingencies?

10:36.300 --> 10:38.930
你是说你找到了另一条路?
You saying you found another way?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.900
或许吧
Maybe.

10:40.970 --> 10:42.400
你什么意思 "或许"?
What do you mean, maybe?

10:42.470 --> 10:44.170
总是会有另外一条路的
There's always been another way,

10:44.230 --> 10:46.670
但那相当于自杀
but it's suicide.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.400
伙计 太冷了  我的手指都冻僵了
Man, I'm so cold my hands are stinging.

11:00.470 --> 11:02.700
你知道他们对中西部的天气怎么说的吗?
You know what they say about weather in the Midwest,

11:02.770 --> 11:04.130
如果你不喜欢
if you don't like it,

11:04.200 --> 11:05.470
等一个小时看看
wait an hour.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.000
我们还得经过医务室出去
We're still going out through the infirmary

11:10.070 --> 11:12.170
我们还得从警卫室开始
and we're still going to do it from the guards' room.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.670
只是中间的计划有所改变
It's just the in-between that's gonna have to change.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.930
慢着 为什么要改变计划?
Now wait a minute. Why are you changing the plan, man?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.600
我们已经通到医务室下面的房间了
We're already through that room beneath the infirmary.

11:18.670 --> 11:19.800
我们只需要打通管道
That's all we gotta do is get through that pipe

11:19.870 --> 11:21.270
就能自由回家了
and we're home free.

11:21.330 --> 11:22.730
他们换管子是有原因的
There's a reason they replaced it

11:22.800 --> 11:24.030
我的达尔文 那是12寸直径的管子
with a 12-inch pipe, Darwin.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.630
人是穿不过的
People can't get through it.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.230
进入医务室的唯一通道
The only way we're getting into that infirmary

11:27.300 --> 11:28.670
是从下面进去
is from beneath.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.600
我们得找另外一条道
We're going to have to find another way.

11:32.130 --> 11:33.630
精神病区?
The psych ward?

11:33.700 --> 11:37.430
那是唯一跟医务室共用地下道的建筑
It's the only building that shares a subsurface line with the infirmary.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.400
你是说
You telling me,

11:38.470 --> 11:40.430
要进到医务室
to get to the infirmary

11:40.500 --> 11:42.430
我们得经过疯子窝?
we gotta go through the whack shack?

11:42.500 --> 11:44.070
除非你有更好的点子
Unless you got a better idea.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.600
这条地下管道
And there's a subsurface line

11:45.670 --> 11:48.400
从警卫室通到精神病区
that runs from the guards' room to the psych ward?

11:48.470 --> 11:49.930
差不多
Sort of.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.970
恩... "差不多"是什么意思?
Oh, whoa, whoa. What do you mean "sort of"?

11:52.030 --> 11:54.130
我们从警卫室的洞进去
We can go into that hole in the guards' room.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.600
沿着66号线40码处有一个壁炉
About 40 yards up Route 66, there's a grate and

11:56.670 --> 11:58.430
那里差不多有一半路程了
that'll get us halfway there.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.230

23:36.330 --> 23:38.130
中场的最棒选手
Mid-level reliever at best.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.360
但他还是那么努力
But he's always working at it.

23:40.430 --> 23:42.360
这正是你老爹这么喜欢他的原因
That's why he's your old man's favorite player.

23:42.430 --> 23:44.430
敬业精神
Work ethic.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.060
维·珀尔
William Prall.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.260
你认识他?
You know him?

24:03.200 --> 24:06.730
精神病区下面的管道...
The pipe system beneath the psych ward is...

24:06.800 --> 24:08.400
恩 有点复杂
Well, it's complex.

24:08.460 --> 24:11.200
很容易迷失方向
Be real easy to get lost.

24:11.260 --> 24:14.130
怎么个复杂法?
How complex can it be?

24:14.200 --> 24:15.900
非常复杂
Very.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.130
在1858年建造这作监狱的时候  管道用的是铅材料
When they built this place in 1858, the pipes were lead.

24:21.200 --> 24:24.230
一个世纪后  人们发现铅对人体有害
A century later, they discovered lead was a health risk

24:24.300 --> 24:25.660
于是转用铜管
so they went to copper.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.460
但他们从没把铅管道拆除
They never removed the lead pipes.

24:27.530 --> 24:28.930
费用太高
Cost too much.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.500
底下的老管道足足有几千码长
There's thousands of yards of the stuff still down there.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.530
没过几年 管道又换成了工业塑料管
And then a few years ago, they switched to industrial plastic.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.430
为了节省费用  新管道布置在旧管道上面
Again, it was cheaper just to lay it over the old stuff.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.130
如果我今晚弄错方向
If I make a wrong turn down there tonight,

24:40.200 --> 24:41.930
很可能就不能按时回来了
I won't make it back by count.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.230
你不会走错的 对吗?
Well, you won't make the wrong turn, right?

27:17.800 --> 27:20.000
真不敢相信
I don't believe my eyes.

27:20.070 --> 27:23.040
穿蓝制服的也会光顾精神病区
One of the blues actually coming into psych ward.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.970
是的 我得用一下洗手间  不想跑老远
I gotta hit the head and I didn't want to walk all the way

27:27.040 --> 27:28.640
回A区再用
back to A-wing.

27:28.700 --> 27:30.770
介意我用一下你们的吗?
Mind if I use your facilities?

27:30.840 --> 27:32.470
当然欢迎了
Yeah, be my guest.

27:34.370 --> 27:39.100
我不知道你们这些家伙为什么这么怕精神病区
I don't know why you guys are so scared of the whack shack.

27:39.170 --> 27:40.870
我是说 在杀人犯和疯子之间选的话
I mean, between the killers and the crazies,

27:40.940 --> 27:42.000
我选择疯子
I'll take the crazies.

27:42.070 --> 27:43.600
因为如果疯子乱来
Because if a crazy steps out of line,

27:43.670 --> 27:46.840
我所要做的只是给他们注射40CC的催眠剂
all I gotta do is shoot him with 40 cc's of "shut your trap"

27:46.900 --> 27:48.500
并且"晚安"
and it's beddy-bye.

27:48.570 --> 27:51.800
恩 洗手间往哪边走?
So, which way is the bathroom?

27:51.870 --> 27:55.300
沿着走廊 穿过门 向右拐
Down the hall, through the door, make a right.

30:59.700 --> 31:00.600
嘿 蓝制服的
Hey, blue.

31:00.670 --> 31:02.070
你在那儿干什么?
What you doing down here?

31:02.140 --> 31:06.470
嘿. 恩... 我只是在找洗手间
Hey.  I was just looking for the bathroom.

31:06.540 --> 31:07.870
在这儿找?
Down here?

31:07.940 --> 31:10.500
是的 你说 沿着走廊 穿过门
Yeah. You said down the hall, through the door

31:10.570 --> 31:11.740
向左拐
and to the left.

31:11.800 --> 31:15.740
不 我说穿过门向右拐
No, I said through the door and make a right.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.770
我的错
My bad.

31:20.270 --> 31:21.600
晚安
Have a good night.

31:30.900 --> 31:33.040
蓝制服! 等等
Blue! Hold up!

31:34.470 --> 31:36.870
你不是要上厕所吗?
Don't you still gotta take a leak?

31:36.940 --> 31:40.600
是啊 往那边走来着?
Yeah. Which way was that again?

31:40.670 --> 31:43.440
腐烂到这种程度
With decomposition this extensive,

31:43.500 --> 31:45.770
最精确的辨认方法
the most accurate identification tool

31:45.840 --> 31:47.240
是牙齿鉴定
is dental records.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.040
我们给死者的牙做了齿模
We made an imprint of the deceased's teeth

31:50.100 --> 31:52.300
并将它与特伦斯·斯蒂德曼的 
and compared them to the dental records

31:52.370 --> 31:53.400
牙齿记录做了比较
of Terrence Steadman.

31:53.470 --> 31:54.400
结果呢?
And?

31:54.470 --> 31:55.940
完全吻合
They were a perfect match.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.370
谢谢 医生
Thank you, Doctor.

32:00.540 --> 32:01.770
这不可能是特伦斯·斯蒂德曼
That can't be Terrence Steadman.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.270
如果你们喜欢可以请别的 
If you like, you can bring in

32:04.340 --> 32:06.370
医生来做鉴定
a forensic examiner of your own choosing to examine the body.

32:06.440 --> 32:09.370
不过我现在就可以告诉你
But I can tell you now,

32:09.440 --> 32:12.270
他们得出的结论和我的肯定一样
they'll come to the same conclusion that I have.

32:13.700 --> 32:14.640
谢谢
Thank you.

32:22.100 --> 32:25.000
希望这样你们总满意了
I hope you're proud of this.

32:27.670 --> 32:30.570
尸体也挖了
You've gotten your pound of flesh.

32:30.640 --> 32:33.140
搞完了吗?
Are you done now?

32:33.200 --> 32:36.600
或者你们想继续伤害我的家庭?
Or would you like to hurt my family some more?

32:38.070 --> 32:39.300
走吧
Come on.

34:14.870 --> 34:16.170
嘿 麦可 在吗?
Hey, Mack, you there?

34:16.240 --> 34:17.240
在
Yeah.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.640
20区怎样?
What's your 20?

34:18.700 --> 34:20.600
我很快查一下
I gotta stop by maintenance real quick.

34:20.670 --> 34:22.200
马上上来
I'll be up in a minute.

35:13.170 --> 35:15.140
你不要紧吧?
You okay?

35:17.600 --> 35:19.900
我被烫伤了
I'm burned.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.100
帮我把衣服脱掉
All right, help me take this off.

35:24.170 --> 35:25.670
不行啊  都烫到你的皮了
No, it's like, burned to your skin.

35:25.740 --> 35:26.840
脱吧
Take it off.

35:26.900 --> 35:28.970
不行 衣服都粘着你的皮了
Are you kidding me? I can't. It's melted into your skin.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.240
如果被警卫发现我穿着这个我就死定了
If the guards catch me wearing this, I'm a dead man.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.570
老兄 这只是...
Bro, it's just not...

35:32.640 --> 35:34.100
动手吧
Do it.

35:34.170 --> 35:35.800
动手脱吧
Please do it.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.040
准备好了?
Ready?

35:41.100 --> 35:42.240
一...
One,

35:42.300 --> 35:43.800
二...
two...

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
迈克尔 我是莎拉
Michael, it's Sara.

36:03.070 --> 36:04.440
感觉怎么样?
How are you feeling?

36:04.500 --> 36:06.140
晕晕的
Groggy.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.600
麻醉剂的缘故
It's the anesthesia.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.440
为什么给我打麻醉?
Why did I have anesthesia?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.800
我们不得不进行手术
We had to perform a procedure.

36:19.770 --> 36:23.970
你是不是觉得人家大学生比你们聪明
So, you got so sick of Scofield's smart mouth

36:24.040 --> 36:25.970
想整整他 是吗?
that you decided to deep fry him, is that it?

36:26.040 --> 36:28.640
我什么都没干 我发誓
I didn't do anything to him, I swear.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.040
让我们回顾一下
Let's review.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.670
一间封闭的牢房
A locked cell.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.340
两个囚犯
Two inmates.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.870
一个被打上了烙印
One gets branded

36:35.940 --> 36:37.670
就像南达科他州的公牛一样
like a South Dakota steer.

36:37.740 --> 36:41.170
我们是不是要把麦尔拉克叫来?
You think we should call Matlock in on this one?

36:42.770 --> 36:45.440
-麦尔拉克?  -费尔南多
-Who's Matlock?  -Fernando,

36:45.500 --> 36:47.100
你不合作的话
you're only going to make things more difficult

36:47.170 --> 36:48.170
只会让事情变得更糟
if you don't cooperate.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.640
我说了我没有烫他
I told you I didn't burn him.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.140
我发现他的时候就这样了
I found him like that.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.540
你发现他这个样子?
You found him like that.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.300
最后点到的时候他表现得很怪异
He was acting kind of weird when we lined up for final count.

36:57.370 --> 36:58.800
他在不停的流汗 你知道的
He was sweating, you know?

36:58.870 --> 37:00.440
他话也不太多
But he's not a big talker anyway,

37:00.500 --> 37:01.840
所以我也没怎么在意
so I didn't think much of it.

37:01.900 --> 37:04.040
午夜时分
Middle of the night,

37:04.100 --> 37:06.670
我起床上厕所
I get up, you know, to shake hands with the president,

37:06.740 --> 37:09.370
发现他已经面朝下躺在地板上了
and there he is, face down on the floor.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.170
狗... 屁
My ass.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.340
医生那边好了以后你们可以问他本人
Ask him yourself when the doc's done with him.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.370
我碰都没碰他
I didn't touch him.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.700
止痛药
Painkillers?

37:24.770 --> 37:27.540
很糟吗?
How bad is it?

37:27.600 --> 37:29.370
快吃药吧
I'd take the pills.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.770
我能看看伤口吗?
Do I get to see it?

37:31.840 --> 37:33.640
不行  现在正上着绷带
No, bandage stays on for now.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.370
吃药吧
Take your pills.

37:37.340 --> 37:39.740
你室友干的?
Your cellmate do this to you?

37:41.240 --> 37:42.540
苏克雷?
Sucre?

37:42.600 --> 37:44.400
不是
No.

37:44.470 --> 37:46.540
谁干的?
Who did?

37:48.970 --> 37:51.770
这我不能告诉你
This is the part where I don't answer you.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.770
好吧
All right.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.300
我派人送你回房去
I'll have you sent back to your cell.

38:01.300 --> 38:02.470
归你了
All yours.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.440
嘿 凯莉 是我
Hey, Katie, it's me.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.000
听着 恩 你能来一下我办公室吗?
Listen, can you come up to my office for a second?

38:18.070 --> 38:19.770
我有点东西要给你看
I got something I wanna show you.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.700
这下我怎么办?
What the hell am I gonna do now?

38:21.770 --> 38:24.070
-我死定了  -很抱歉 表兄
-I'm a dead man. -I'm sorry, cuz.

38:24.140 --> 38:26.140
是个意外
It was an accident.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.200
布伦看到这个会发飙的
Bull's gonna see this and flip his lid.

38:28.270 --> 38:29.400
嘿 啊胖!
Hey, slim!

38:29.470 --> 38:31.100
我的制服准备好了吗?
You got my uni ready?

38:31.170 --> 38:34.600
出了点小问题 头儿
There's been a bit of a problem, boss.

38:34.670 --> 38:36.440
他妈的这是什么?
What the hell is this?

38:36.500 --> 38:39.740
我把熨斗忘在上面太久了
I left the iron on it too long.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.700
你这家伙有多胖就有多蠢
You are as stupid as you are fat,

38:41.770 --> 38:43.340
知道吗 D罩杯?
do you know that, D-cups?

38:43.400 --> 38:45.400
这件新衬衣得从你的工资里扣
My new shirt's coming out of your kick.

38:49.170 --> 38:50.470
你现在得告诉我
You're gonna tell me right now.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.100
告诉你什么?
Tell you what?

38:52.170 --> 38:53.570
到底发生了什么事
What the hell you got going on

38:53.640 --> 38:55.370
让这件衣服烫成这个样子?
that's got you burning up guard suits?

38:55.440 --> 38:58.670
相信我 你知道的越少越好
Trust me, primo. The less you know, the better.

39:12.370 --> 39:13.470
有消息吗?

39:13.540 --> 39:15.140
没
No.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.340
还没有
No, not yet.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.740
化验需要几天时间
Testing takes a couple of days.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.970
你还记得我爸爸吗?
What do you remember of Dad?

39:22.040 --> 39:23.700
你爸爸?
Your dad?

39:23.770 --> 39:25.440
我不认识他
I didn't know him.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.340
我们小时候  你妈妈经常说一些 
Your mom said some pretty horrible stuff about him

39:28.400 --> 39:29.570
有关他的不好的话
when we were growing up.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.170
我想我看到他了
I think I saw him

39:31.240 --> 39:32.870
当我在电椅上的时候
when I was in the chair.

39:32.940 --> 39:35.040
林肯...

39:38.600 --> 39:39.870

How would you know?

39:39.940 --> 39:42.100
你已经有30年没见过他了
You haven't seen his face in 30 years.

39:42.170 --> 39:43.300
登记用的名字
The name that was used,

39:43.370 --> 39:44.800
维·珀尔

39:44.870 --> 39:48.200
-怎么说?  -这家伙是当时芝加哥的棒球手
-So?  -It's the name of this guy who threw for Chicago back in the day.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.600
老爸和我很喜欢他
Dad and me were really into him

39:49.670 --> 39:51.870
但我都差点忘记了
but I'd forgotten all about him.

39:51.940 --> 39:53.500
真的很怪
It's really weird.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.370
那些梦 回忆
Been having these dreams, memories,

39:57.440 --> 40:01.470

40:01.540 --> 40:03.940
这个来观刑的家伙
This man who came to the execution,

40:04.000 --> 40:05.640
你怎么知道他用那个名字的?
how do you know he used that name?

40:05.700 --> 40:07.000
珀尔告诉我的
Pope told me.

40:07.070 --> 40:10.070
是在你做梦之前还是做梦之后?
Was that before or after you had the dream?

40:12.500 --> 40:15.740
听着 我很抱歉 好吗?
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

40:15.800 --> 40:18.170
我不是想怀疑你说的一切
I don't mean to challenge what you're saying,

40:18.240 --> 40:21.340
但你爸爸早就在你的生命里消失了
but your dad's been MIA almost your entire life.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.900
我知道我看见了
I know what I saw, V.

40:25.070 --> 40:27.300

This is the security camera footage of the courthouse

40:37.740 --> 40:40.640
就在柯尔斯法官获得那些文件的那晚  看看这个家伙
from the night that Judge Kessler got those documents.Now, check out this guy.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.170
他相当的专业
He is very skilled.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.670
他走的很随意  不易引起别人的怀疑
He moves casually enough to avoid suspicion.

40:47.740 --> 40:50.140
看到他转弯时移动帽子的动作了吗?
You see how he shifts his hat

40:50.200 --> 40:52.270
为了挡住他的脸?
when he turns corners to hide his face?

40:52.340 --> 40:55.540
他很清楚这些摄像机的位置
He knows exactly where those cameras are.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.490
等等 打住
Wait. Right there.

40:59.560 --> 41:00.920
看到反光了吗?
See that reflection?

41:00.990 --> 41:02.460
倒带 倒带
Rewind it. Rewind it.

41:04.890 --> 41:06.420
对 能放大吗?
Right. Can you blow that up

41:17.820 --> 41:19.690
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

手术的时候我弄出来的
I removed it during the débridement procedure.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.120
有什么问题吗?
And what about it?

41:37.190 --> 41:38.560
这纤维

41:38.620 --> 41:39.820
不是囚犯制服的材料

41:39.890 --> 41:41.920
那它从哪里来的?
Where'd it come from then?

41:41.990 --> 41:44.460

42:37.120 --> 42:38.260
怎么了?
What's wrong?

42:40.090 --> 42:43.090
蓝图 我们用来
The blueprints,the ones we need to

42:43.160 --> 42:46.090

42:46.160 --> 42:50.320
带我们离开这儿的地图...
our map out of here,

42:50.390 --> 42:52.120
没有了
they're gone.
