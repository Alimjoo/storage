00:07.110 --> 00:09.350
等一下  先别放
Okay, hold on, don't shoot.

00:10.990 --> 00:12.060
看准目标了吗
You see where you're going?

00:12.780 --> 00:13.770
那好
Okay.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.480
想想要如何射中目标
Now, let's worry about how you get there.

00:16.910 --> 00:18.060
脚往外挪一点
Gotta move your foot here.

00:18.580 --> 00:19.770
脚尖对准这边
Point your toe this way.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.150
胯向这边转
Your hips here.

00:22.210 --> 00:23.150
好吗
Okay?

00:24.290 --> 00:26.030
-能看到吗  -能
- Can you see? - Yeah.

00:26.050 --> 00:26.750
确定吗
Are you sure?

00:26.750 --> 00:29.070
-现在呢  还能看到吗  -看不到
-How about now? Can you see now?  - No.

00:29.090 --> 00:29.950
那现在呢
How about now?

00:31.720 --> 00:32.740
好
All right.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.450
准备好了吗  三根手指
Ready? Three fingers.

00:36.430 --> 00:37.710
漂亮
Nice!

00:38.850 --> 00:40.580
投得好  孩子
Nice throw, kiddo.

00:40.980 --> 00:41.710
球来了
Here you go.

00:42.190 --> 00:44.650
你们要蛋黄酱还是芥末酱
Hey, you guys want mayo? Or mustard?

00:44.650 --> 00:45.630
还是都要
Or both?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.230
谁在热狗上放蛋黄酱
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

00:48.230 --> 00:49.280
也许你两个弟弟会
Probably your brothers.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.900
两份芥末酱  谢谢  孩儿他妈
Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, Mama.

00:51.910 --> 00:52.890
好的
Got it!

00:53.070 --> 00:55.320
内特  蛋黄酱还是芥末酱
Nate, mayo or mustard?

00:55.330 --> 00:56.770
番茄酱行吗
How about ketchup?

00:57.120 --> 00:59.100
番茄酱  番茄酱我也有
Or ketchup. I got ketchup, too.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.270
注意手肘
Mind your elbow.

01:03.420 --> 01:04.540
射得好  鹰眼
Good job, hawk-eye.

01:04.540 --> 01:05.280
去拿箭吧
Go get your arrow.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.240
你们俩
Hey, guys!

01:10.260 --> 01:12.700
别练了  汤好了
Enough practice. Soup's on!

01:12.840 --> 01:13.990
好的
All right.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.660
我们来了  饿死了
We're coming. We're hungry.

01:16.430 --> 01:17.790
莱拉  我们走
Lila, let's go.

01:21.020 --> 01:21.960
莱拉

01:25.190 --> 01:26.130

Babe?

01:43.960 --> 01:44.940

Babe?

01:47.040 --> 01:47.900

Boys!

01:50.380 --> 01:51.240
孩子们
Boys!

01:53.300 --> 01:54.490
劳拉
Laura!

02:38.590 --> 02:39.910
你不用这样的
You don't need to do that.

02:40.140 --> 02:42.750
因为你只需要保持这个姿势
Because, uh, you're just holding the position.

02:43.980 --> 02:44.920
对
Oh, yeah.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.750
差点就中了
That was close.

02:48.230 --> 02:50.150
进门  我们现在各得一分
That's a goal. We are now one apiece.

02:50.150 --> 02:51.630
我想再试一次
I would like to try again.

02:54.110 --> 02:56.220
我们平手  紧张吗
We're tied up. Feel the tension?

02:56.530 --> 02:57.430
好玩吧
It's fun.

02:58.070 --> 03:00.180
射得太差了  现在你有机会赢了
That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win.

03:01.450 --> 03:02.730
你赢了
And you've won.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.560
恭喜
Congratulations.

03:04.700 --> 03:05.690
比赛公平
Fair game.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.440
玩得不错
Good sport.

03:09.670 --> 03:10.530
开心吗
You have fun?

03:12.840 --> 03:13.900
挺开心的
It was fun.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.550
这东西在录吗
This thing on?

03:41.030 --> 03:42.980
波茨小姐  小派
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.560
如果你发现了这段录像
If you find this recording...

03:47.290 --> 03:50.290
别发到社交网络上
don't post it on social media.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.730
不然肯定要哭死一群
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

03:52.670 --> 03:54.450
我不知道你是否会看到
I don't know if you're ever gonna see these.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.740
我都不知道你是否还...
I don't even know if you're still...

03:57.840 --> 03:59.200
天呐  但愿你还在
Oh, God, I hope so.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.510
今天是第21天
Today's day 21.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.660
不  第22天
No, uh, 22.

04:05.850 --> 04:08.350
如果不是因为凝视真正的虚无空间
You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror...

04:08.350 --> 04:10.390
而产生的存在恐惧
of staring into the literal void of space,

04:10.400 --> 04:12.590
我会说我今天感觉好一点了
I'd say I'm feeling a little better today.

04:12.980 --> 04:14.400
感染已经结束了
Infection's run its course,

04:14.400 --> 04:16.440
这要谢谢那位蓝恶魔
thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.220
你一定会很喜欢她的
Oh, you'd love her.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.100
非常务实
Very practical.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.720
就是有点虐待倾向
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.660
燃料电池在打斗中被损坏
So, the fuel cells were cracked during battle...

04:29.660 --> 04:31.750
我们找到了办法逆转离子电荷
and we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge...

04:31.750 --> 04:34.280
争取到了大约48小时的飞行时间
and bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.

04:38.010 --> 04:39.870
但是现在已经彻底不能用了
But it's now dead in the water.

04:40.050 --> 04:43.290
距最近的便利店有上千光年
Thousand light years from the nearest 7-Eleven.

04:44.850 --> 04:47.040
明天早上氧气将会耗尽
Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning...

04:48.810 --> 04:50.130
然后就完了
and that'll be it.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.990
小派  我知道我说过再不制造意外了
Pep, I know I said no more surprises...

04:57.000 --> 05:00.330
但我得说  我真的希望能完成这最后一个
but I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.

05:00.820 --> 05:02.050
但是现在看来...
But it looks like...

05:02.860 --> 05:04.390
你知道看起来如何
Well, you know what it looks like.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.980
别为此而难过
Don't feel bad about this.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.480
其实  如果你痛心难过个几周
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks...

05:11.660 --> 05:14.280
然后带着巨大的罪恶感继续生活下去...
and then move on with enormous guilt...

05:20.010 --> 05:22.010
也许我应该躺会儿
I should probably lie down for a minute.

05:22.010 --> 05:23.280
让眼睛休息一下
Go rest my eyes.

05:26.930 --> 05:28.120
请知道
Please know...

05:29.810 --> 05:33.040
当我渐渐睡去  会和近来的每晚一样
when I drift off, it'll be like every night lately.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.050
我很好  真的很好
I'm fine. Totally fine.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.590
我会梦到你
I dream about you.

05:40.190 --> 05:41.510
因为一直都是你
Because it's always you.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.560
没能阻止他
Couldn't stop him.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.560
我也一样
Neither could I.

09:06.570 --> 09:07.510
等等
Hang on.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.640
我没救下那孩子
I lost the kid.

09:14.410 --> 09:15.810
托尼  我们都输了
Tony, we lost.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.140
派珀她...
Is, uh...?

09:20.250 --> 09:22.020
-太好了  -天呐
- Oh, good. - Oh, my God!

09:22.960 --> 09:23.980
天呐
Oh, my God!

09:29.510 --> 09:30.450
没事了
It's okay.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.080
距灭霸来到地球  已经过了23天
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.

Where is he now? Where?

10:08.290 --> 10:09.240
我们不知道
We don't know.

10:10.090 --> 10:12.870
他开了个传送门  穿过去了
He just opened a portal and walked through.

10:15.760 --> 10:16.830
他是哪根筋不对
What's wrong with him?

10:17.640 --> 10:18.910
他很愤怒
Oh, he's pissed.

10:20.140 --> 10:21.290
他觉得自己失败了
He thinks he failed.

10:22.730 --> 10:23.850
没错  他是失败了
Which, of course, he did...

10:23.850 --> 10:26.190

Maybe I am.

10:29.980 --> 10:32.110

We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now.

扫描外太空
Deep space scans...

10:33.190 --> 10:36.390

Tony, you fought him.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.640
谁跟你说的
Who told you that?

10:40.950 --> 10:41.870
我没跟他"交手"
I didn't fight him.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.910
他用一颗星球暴揍了我
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

10:43.910 --> 10:46.410
然后那个布里克街魔术师把宝石交出去了
while the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store.

10:46.420 --> 10:47.640
实情就是这样  根本谈不上交手
That's what happened. There was no fight,

10:47.640 --> 10:48.830
-好吧  -他根本不可战胜
- Ok.  - 'cause he's not beatable.

10:48.830 --> 10:52.110
他有没有透露过任何线索或坐标
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?

10:54.630 --> 10:56.300
我几年前就预料到了
I saw this coming a few years back.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.200
我看到了幻象  我本来不想相信
I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

10:58.680 --> 10:59.830
以为自己是做梦
Thought I was dreaming.

10:59.850 --> 11:00.930
托尼  我需要你集中精神
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

11:00.930 --> 11:02.790
我曾经也需要你
And I needed you.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.270
我是指过去
As in, past tense.

11:04.270 --> 11:07.670
那比你现在的需求重要  太迟了  哥们
That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy.

11:07.980 --> 11:09.000
抱歉
Sorry.

11:09.860 --> 11:12.670
知道我需要什么吗  我需要刮胡子
You know what I need? I need a shave.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.320
而且我记得我告诉过你们所有人
And I believe I remember telling all youse...

11:15.320 --> 11:16.860
托尼  托尼
Tony, Tony!

11:16.860 --> 11:20.300
还在和不在的  我们需要的
...alive and otherwise, that what we needed

11:20.340 --> 11:22.580
是一套保护世界的战衣
was a suit of armor around the world.

11:22.580 --> 11:23.240
记得吗
Remember that?

11:23.240 --> 11:26.250
不管那是否会影响到我们宝贵的自由
Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.580
那才是我们曾需要的
That's what we needed.

11:27.580 --> 11:28.710
但那并没成功  不是吗
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

11:28.710 --> 11:30.280
我说过我们会输的
I said we'd lose.

11:30.330 --> 11:33.110
而你说  "那就一起输"
You said, "We'll do that together, too."

11:33.250 --> 11:34.360
你猜怎么着  队长
And guess what, Cap?

11:34.460 --> 11:35.910
我们输了
We lost.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.820
而你不在场
And you weren't there.

11:38.840 --> 11:39.970
不过我们就是干这个的  不是吗
But that's what we do, right?

11:39.970 --> 11:43.220
总是在事后行动  我们是"复仇者"
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers."

11:43.220 --> 11:45.140
"复仇者"  而不是"预防者"
We're the "Avengers," Not the "Pre-vengers."

11:45.140 --> 11:46.020
-好了  -对吗
- Okay. - Right?

11:46.020 --> 11:47.730
-你说得很明白了  先坐下吧  -好
- You made your point. Just sit down, okay? - Okay.

11:47.730 --> 11:48.890
-不  我还没说完  -托尼
- No, no, here's my point. You know what? - Tony,

11:48.890 --> 11:50.100
-对了  她可真棒  -你身体不好  坐下
- She's great by the way. - you're sick. Sit down.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.900

We need you. You're new blood.

11:51.900 --> 11:52.980
一群身心疲惫的老家伙
Bunch of tired old mules.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.280
我没什么可给你的  队长
I got nothing for you, Cap.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.930
没坐标
I got no coordinates...

11:56.940 --> 11:59.590
没线索  没战略  没选择
no clues, no strategies, no options.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.180
屁都没有
Zero. Zip. Nada.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.810
也没有信任  骗子
No trust, liar.

12:07.620 --> 12:08.900
给你  拿着
Here, take this.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.900
你找到他  戴上它
You find him, you put that on...

12:11.630 --> 12:12.780
躲起来
you hide.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.820
-托尼  -我没事
- Tony! - I'm fine.

12:16.380 --> 12:17.280
让我...
Let me...

12:24.680 --> 12:25.930
布鲁斯给他注射了镇静剂
Bruce gave him a sedative.

12:25.930 --> 12:28.420
估计他今天之内都不会醒了
He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.270
你们照顾好他
You guys take care of him...

12:30.270 --> 12:32.340
我回来时给他捎点克佐利亚的神药
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back.

12:33.190 --> 12:33.980
你要去哪
Where are you going?

12:33.980 --> 12:35.590
去杀灭霸
To kill Thanos.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.200
我们通常一起行动
You know, we usually work as a team here and, uh,

12:42.200 --> 12:44.160
私下里说一句  现在士气有点低落
between you and I, morale's a little fragile.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.240
我们知道太空是你的领域
We realize up there is more your territory,

12:46.240 --> 12:47.810
但这也是我们的战斗
but this is our fight, too.

12:47.830 --> 12:48.910
你知道他在哪吗
You even know where he is?

12:48.910 --> 12:50.200
我认识可能知道的人
I know people who might.

12:50.210 --> 12:51.320
不必麻烦了
Don't bother.

12:52.710 --> 12:54.650
我可以告诉你灭霸在哪
I can tell you where Thanos is.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.700
灭霸花了很长时间来完善我
Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me.

13:00.630 --> 13:04.240
他改造我时  总爱说他的伟大计划
And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.370
就算被拆解了  我仍然想讨好他
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.

13:07.930 --> 13:09.210
我会问
I'd ask...

13:09.930 --> 13:12.340
等计划完成后  我们去哪
where would we go once his plan was complete?

13:13.230 --> 13:14.920
他每次的回答都一样
And his answer was always the same.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.550
"去花园"
"To the Garden."

13:21.030 --> 13:23.740
真有爱  灭霸还有退休计划
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan.

13:23.740 --> 13:24.890
那他在哪
So, where is he?

13:25.700 --> 13:27.580
灭霸打响指时
When Thanos snapped his fingers...

13:27.580 --> 13:29.990
地球成了宇宙级能量涌的
Earth became ground zero for a power surge

13:30.000 --> 13:32.040
爆发点
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.980
可谓前无古人
No one's ever seen anything like it.

13:34.170 --> 13:36.230
直到两天前...
Until two days ago...

13:37.540 --> 13:38.950
这个星球上又发生了一次
on this planet.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.280
灭霸在那儿
Thanos is there.

13:43.260 --> 13:44.870
他又用了一次宝石
He used the stones again.

13:47.050 --> 13:49.100
我们去的话  人手不足
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know?

13:49.100 --> 13:50.560
宝石还在他手里  所以...
Look, he's still got the stones, so...

13:50.560 --> 13:51.630
那我们就去夺回来
So, let's get 'em.

13:52.310 --> 13:53.850
用宝石把大家救回来
Use them to bring everyone back.

13:53.850 --> 13:54.940
就这样
Just like that?

13:54.940 --> 13:56.850
对  就这样
Yeah. Just like that.

13:56.860 --> 14:00.230
哪怕有一丝挽回一切的希望
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this...

14:00.230 --> 14:02.820
我们也必须为不在这里的每个人一试
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.530
就算我们去  我们怎么知道
If we do this, how do we know

14:04.530 --> 14:07.070
结局会跟上次不一样
it's gonna end any differently than it did before?

14:07.070 --> 14:08.980
因为上次你们没有我
Because before you didn't have me.

14:09.490 --> 14:10.600
新来的妹子
Hey, new girl?

14:11.000 --> 14:14.110
这里每个人都是干超级英雄的
Everybody in this room is about that superhero life.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.330
要是你不介意我问问
And if you don't mind my asking,

14:15.330 --> 14:16.710
这么久以来你都去哪了
where the hell have you been all this time?

14:16.710 --> 14:19.030
宇宙里还有很多星球
There are a lot of other planets in the universe.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.780
可惜那些地方没有你们
And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.

14:41.730 --> 14:42.930
我喜欢她
I like this one.

14:48.530 --> 14:50.560
我们去干掉那个王八蛋
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

这里谁没上过太空
Who here hasn't been to space?

15:18.100 --> 15:18.850
怎么了
Why?

15:18.850 --> 15:20.800
你们最好别吐在我飞船里
You better not throw up on my ship.

Approaching jump in three...

I'll head down for recon.

This is gonna work, Steve.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.130
我知道
I know it will.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.510
因为如果不成功  我不知道该怎么办
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

16:08.110 --> 16:11.740
没有卫星  没有战舰  没有军队
No satellites. No ships. No armies.

16:11.740 --> 16:13.850
没有任何地面防御
No ground defenses of any kind.

16:15.370 --> 16:16.600
只有他
It's just him.

16:17.790 --> 16:19.110
那就够了
And that's enough.

17:48.710 --> 17:49.950
不
Oh, no.

17:59.930 --> 18:00.870

Where are they?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.420
回答问题
Answer the question.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.880
宇宙需要修正
The universe required correction.

18:08.270 --> 18:11.840
之后  宝石就没有用了
After that, the stones served no purpose...

18:12.110 --> 18:13.650
只是诱惑
beyond temptation.

18:13.650 --> 18:15.310
你杀了数万亿生灵
You murdered trillions!

18:16.780 --> 18:18.430
你应该感激
You should be grateful.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.060

Where are the stones?

18:24.460 --> 18:25.360

Gone.

18:26.170 --> 18:27.790
化成原子了
Reduced to atoms.

18:27.790 --> 18:29.500
你两天前还用过的
You used them two days ago!

18:29.500 --> 18:32.780
我用宝石摧毁了宝石
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

18:33.470 --> 18:35.530
差点要了我的命
It nearly killed me.

18:36.590 --> 18:38.200
但大业已成
But the work is done.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.790
注定会完成的
It always will be.

18:43.020 --> 18:46.500

I am inevitable.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.070
我们得把这里翻个底朝天  他肯定在撒谎
We have to tear this place apart. He has to be lying!

18:51.070 --> 18:52.680
我父亲有很多特点
My father is many things.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.010
但他不撒谎
A liar is not one of them.

18:59.370 --> 19:00.770
谢谢你  女儿
Thank you, daughter.

19:03.370 --> 19:05.980
也许我过去对你太残酷了
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

19:12.130 --> 19:13.110
什么
What?

19:13.670 --> 19:14.990
你干了什么
What did you do?

19:16.970 --> 19:18.540
我砍脑袋了
I went for the head.

20:02.800 --> 20:11.140

20:35.880 --> 20:37.630
这是五年来第一次
It's the first time in five years.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.410
我坐在餐桌前
You know? I'm sitting there at dinner.

20:41.180 --> 20:43.120
都不知道该谈些什么
I didn't even know what to talk about.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.040
你们谈了什么
What did you talk about?

20:46.140 --> 20:49.540
还是老一套  时过境迁了
Same old crap. You know, how things have changed.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.050
我的工作  他的工作
My job, his job.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.590
我们多想念纽约大都会队
How much we miss the Mets.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.140
然后就陷入了沉默
And then things got quiet...

21:00.700 --> 21:04.310
侍者上沙拉时  他哭了
then he cried as they were serving the salads.

21:04.570 --> 21:05.930
那你呢
What about you?

21:07.120 --> 21:10.480
我上甜点之前哭的
I cried just before dessert.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.860
但我明天还要再见他  所以...
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

21:16.920 --> 21:17.900
很棒
That's great.

21:18.260 --> 21:19.960
你已经完成了最难的部分  你鼓起勇气行动了
You did the hardest part. You took the jump.

21:19.970 --> 21:21.820
尽管你不知道结果会如何
You didn't know where you were gonna come down.

21:22.880 --> 21:23.590
就是这样
And that's it.

21:23.590 --> 21:27.410
我们得这样勇敢地迈出一个个小步
That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take...

21:27.470 --> 21:30.880
努力再次让自己完整  寻找意义
to try and become whole again, try and find purpose.

21:32.810 --> 21:34.350
我1945年落入冰层中
I went in the ice in '45,

21:34.350 --> 21:36.380
那时我才刚遇见自己的一生挚爱
right after I met the love of my life.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.630
再醒来已是七十年后
Woke up 70 years later.

21:42.610 --> 21:43.970
人得向前看
You gotta move on.

21:47.370 --> 21:48.480
必须向前看
Gotta move on.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.570
世界在我们手中
The world is in our hands.

It's left to us, guys.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.570
我们得做点什么
And we gotta do something with it.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.030
不然...
Otherwise...

22:04.380 --> 22:06.290

never even had a chance to get their guns off.

27:45.980 --> 27:47.790

there's a part of me that doesn't even wanna find him.

Some do.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.610
但是我们不行
But not us.

29:37.710 --> 29:39.610
如果我放下过去  谁来做这些事
If I move on, who does this?

29:40.130 --> 29:41.870
也许这些事不需要做
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

29:46.510 --> 29:48.120
以前我一无所有
I used to have nothing.

29:49.890 --> 29:51.460
然后我拥有了这些
And then I got this.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.210
这份工作
This job.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.470
这个家庭
This family.

30:03.660 --> 30:05.010
我因此
And I was

30:05.620 --> 30:07.480
变得更好
I was better because of it.

30:13.830 --> 30:17.610
虽然他们都不在了
And even though they're gone...

30:21.300 --> 30:23.320
我还是在尽量变得更好
I'm still trying to be better.

30:26.970 --> 30:29.040
我觉得我们俩都需要有点私生活
I think we both need to get a life.

30:31.810 --> 30:33.000
你先来
You first.

30:39.980 --> 30:41.020
有人在吗
Is anyone home?

30:41.030 --> 30:42.930
我是斯科特·朗
This is, uh, Scott Lang.

30:43.110 --> 30:46.180
我们几年前在机场见过
We met a few years ago at the airport...

30:46.200 --> 30:47.350
德国的机场
in Germany?

30:47.620 --> 30:50.330
我是那个变大的人  我当时戴了面具
I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on.

30:50.330 --> 30:51.990
-你们大概认不出我  -这是以前的信息吗
- You wouldn't recognize me. - Is this an old message?

30:52.000 --> 30:55.290
蚁人  我知道你们知道我
Ant-Man? I know you know... I know you know that.

30:55.290 --> 30:58.030
-那是前门  -我真的需要和你们谈谈
- It's the front gate.  - I really need to talk to you guys.

31:04.010 --> 31:04.950
斯科特
Scott.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.180
你没事吧
Are you okay?

31:07.180 --> 31:08.080
我没事
Yeah.

31:10.050 --> 31:12.370
你们俩学过量子物理学吗
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?

31:12.890 --> 31:14.500
只有一点点了解
Only to make conversation.

31:15.390 --> 31:16.630
好吧  是这样...
All right, so...

31:17.440 --> 31:20.340
五年前  就在...
five years ago, right before...

31:20.820 --> 31:22.130
灭霸的事发生前...
Thanos...

31:22.280 --> 31:24.430
我进入了一个叫量子域的地方
I was in a place called the quantum realm.

31:24.570 --> 31:27.530
量子域有它自己的微观宇宙
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe.

31:27.530 --> 31:29.520
要想进去  你得变得非常非常小
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.

31:29.530 --> 31:31.020
霍普  她是我的...
Hope. She's my, um...

31:33.040 --> 31:34.560
她本是我的...
She was my...

31:35.960 --> 31:37.750
她本应该把我拉出来的
She was supposed to pull me out.

31:37.750 --> 31:39.460
然后灭霸的事发生了...
And then Thanos happened...

31:39.460 --> 31:41.570
我就被困在里面了
and I got stuck in there.

31:41.670 --> 31:43.590
很遗憾  这五年一定很漫长
I'm sorry, that must have been a very long five years.

31:43.590 --> 31:44.860
是啊  问题就在这里
Yeah, but that's just it.

31:45.130 --> 31:46.450
并不漫长
It wasn't.

31:46.590 --> 31:48.130
对我来说  只有五个小时
For me, it was five hours.

31:48.130 --> 31:49.510
量子域的法则
See, the rules of the quantum realm

31:49.510 --> 31:50.720
跟这个世界不一样
aren't like they are up here.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.390
一切都不可预测
Everything is unpredictable.

31:52.390 --> 31:53.760
那个三明治有人要吗
Is that anybody's sandwich?

31:53.770 --> 31:55.040
我饿死了
I'm starving.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.500
斯科特
Scott.

31:56.810 --> 31:58.250
你说的是什么意思
What are you talking about?

31:59.060 --> 31:59.880
所以...
So...

32:01.190 --> 32:02.760
我想说的是...
what I'm saying is...

32:03.690 --> 32:06.260
在量子域里  时间有不同的运行方式
time works differently in the quantum realm.

32:06.360 --> 32:07.850
唯一的问题是  现在
The only problem is right now

32:08.070 --> 32:09.910
我们没法在其中定位
we don't have a way to navigate it.

32:09.910 --> 32:11.060
但如果有办法呢
But what if we did?

32:11.370 --> 32:12.450
我一直在思考这个
I can't stop thinking about it.

32:12.450 --> 32:14.950
如果我们能想办法控制这种混沌
What if we could somehow control the chaos...

32:14.950 --> 32:15.950
并在其中定位呢
and we could navigate it?

32:15.950 --> 32:17.700
如果我们有办法
What if there was a way...

32:17.710 --> 32:19.370
在某个特定时间点
that we could enter the quantum realm

32:19.370 --> 32:20.620
进入量子域
at a certain point in time...

32:20.630 --> 32:22.130
然后在另一个特定时间点
but then exit the quantum realm

32:22.130 --> 32:23.710
离开量子域呢
at another point in time?

32:23.710 --> 32:24.570
比如说
Like...

32:25.800 --> 32:27.780
-在灭霸打响指之前  -等等
- Like before Thanos. - Wait.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.660
你指的是时间机器吗
Are you talking about a time machine?

32:29.720 --> 32:32.590
不  不  当然不是  不是时间机器
No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.910
这更像是...
This is more like a...

32:35.930 --> 32:37.520
没错  就是时间机器
Yeah. Like a time machine.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.540
我知道  这很疯狂  非常疯狂
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

32:40.230 --> 32:41.600
但我就一直在思考这个
But I can't stop thinking about it.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.880
肯定有...
There's gotta be...

32:43.860 --> 32:45.090
办法的...
some way...

32:45.440 --> 32:46.900
-是很疯狂  -斯科特
- It's crazy. - Scott.

32:46.900 --> 32:48.610
我能收到一只浣熊发的邮件
I get emails from a raccoon...

32:48.610 --> 32:50.970
所以  再没什么算是"疯狂"了
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

32:51.490 --> 32:53.520
那么  我们要跟谁讨论这个
So, who do we talk to about this?

33:11.630 --> 33:12.620
开饭咯
Chow time!

33:15.180 --> 33:16.370
摩古娜
Maguna.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.420
摩根·H·斯塔克  你想吃午饭吗
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

33:23.100 --> 33:24.690
定义一下"午饭"  不然
Define "lunch" or be

33:24.690 --> 33:26.050
-就等着被灭吧  -好吧
- disintegrated. - Okay.

33:26.940 --> 33:28.150
你不应该戴这个  好吗
You should not be wearing that, okay?

33:28.150 --> 33:29.900
这是我给妈妈做的周年纪念
That is part of a special anniversary gift

33:29.900 --> 33:31.180
特别礼物里的
I'm making for Mom.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.060
好了  想吃午饭吗
There you go. You thinking about lunch?

33:37.330 --> 33:39.540
我可以拿莴苣包一把蟋蟀给你
I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.

33:39.540 --> 33:41.360
-不  -你不是想吃那个吗
- No. - That's what you want.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.870
你怎么找到这个的
How did you find this?

33:43.880 --> 33:45.630
-在车库里  -真的吗
- Garage. - Really?

33:45.630 --> 33:47.860
-你是有意去找它的吗  -没有
- Were you looking for it? - No.

33:48.590 --> 33:50.160
反正我找到了
I found it, though.

33:50.630 --> 33:52.340
你喜欢进车库是吗
You like going in the garage, huh?

33:52.340 --> 33:53.990
爸爸也是
So does Daddy.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.580
其实没关系  我给妈妈买的礼物她从来不穿
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her.

34:00.140 --> 34:01.250
那么  我要...
So, I'm gonna...

34:18.950 --> 34:21.490
不  我们知道这听上去多疯狂
No. We know what it sounds like.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.830
托尼  在经历过这一切之后
Tony, after everything you've seen,

34:22.830 --> 34:24.710
-难道还真有不可能的事吗  -量子波动
- is anything really impossible? - Quantum fluctuation

34:24.710 --> 34:26.040
达到普朗克尺度
messes with the Planck scale...

34:24.720 --> 34:27.770
大卫·德将量子理论与多重宇宙理论结合
提出回到过去只是进入另一个平行宇宙

34:26.040 --> 34:27.750
并引出德氏观点
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition.

34:27.750 --> 34:29.070
我们能认同这一点吗
Can we agree on that?

34:29.340 --> 34:30.170
谢谢
Thank you.

34:30.170 --> 34:32.860
通俗地讲  就是你无法回到这里了
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.

34:32.860 --> 34:33.970
-我回来了  -不对
- I did. - No.

34:33.970 --> 34:35.530
你是碰巧幸存了
You accidentally survived.

34:36.010 --> 34:38.120
这是十亿分之一的宇宙侥幸
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

34:38.470 --> 34:39.870
现在你想进行...
And now you wanna pull a...

34:40.680 --> 34:41.750
你怎么说的来着
What do you call it?

34:43.640 --> 34:44.940
时间盗窃
A time heist?

34:44.940 --> 34:47.350
没错  时间盗窃  当然了
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.800
我们之前怎么没想到呢
Why didn't we think of this before?

34:49.440 --> 34:51.400
因为这太好笑了  简直是白日梦
Because it's laughable. Because it's a pipe dream.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.140
无限宝石都在过去
The stones are in the past.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.860
我们可以回去拿到它们
We could go back, we could get them.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.200
我们可以自己打响指  把所有人带回来
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.450
或者让事情变得更糟  对吗
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?

34:59.450 --> 35:00.990
我觉得我们不会的
I don't believe we would.

35:00.990 --> 35:04.150
不得不说  有时我还挺怀念你的乐观
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

35:04.410 --> 35:06.080
然而  如果没有合理可行的方法
However, high hopes won't help

35:06.080 --> 35:08.210
来安全地进行所谓的时间盗窃
if there's no logical, tangible way

35:08.210 --> 35:12.170
寄予厚望也没用
for me to safely execute said time heist.

35:12.170 --> 35:13.840
我认为最可能的后果
I believe the most likely outcome

35:13.840 --> 35:14.880
就是我们共同灭亡
will be our collective demise.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.910
只要我们严格遵守时间旅行的规则就不会
Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.

35:18.090 --> 35:20.850
就是说  不可以跟过去的自己交谈
All right? It means no talking to our past selves...

35:20.850 --> 35:22.220
不可以给体育比赛下注
no betting on sporting events.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.630
我得让你打住了  斯科特
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.690
你真要跟我说
Are you seriously telling me

35:26.690 --> 35:28.270
你拯救宇宙的计划
that your plan to save the universe...

35:28.270 --> 35:30.420
是基于《回到未来》的吗
is based on Back to the Future?

35:31.400 --> 35:33.300
-是吗  -不是
- Is it? - No.

35:33.320 --> 35:34.400
很好  你刚刚害我有点担忧
Good. You had me worried there.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.550
因为那就扯淡了
'Cause that would be horseshit.

35:35.650 --> 35:38.030
量子物理的原理不是那样的
That's not how quantum physics works.

35:38.030 --> 35:38.930
托尼
Tony.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.940
我们必须奋起抗争
We have to take a stand.

35:43.370 --> 35:45.850
我们抗争了  但还是落得这个地步
We did stand. And yet, here we are.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.420
我知道你有很多顾虑
I know you got a lot on the line.

35:49.420 --> 35:51.360
你有妻子  女儿
You got a wife, a daughter.

35:52.130 --> 35:54.200
但我也失去了对我非常重要的人
But I lost someone very important to me.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.280
很多人都是
A lotta people did.

35:56.420 --> 35:59.510
而现在  我们有机会让她回来
And now, now we have a chance to bring her back...

35:59.510 --> 36:00.890
让所有人回来
to bring everyone back,

36:00.890 --> 36:02.220
而你却告诉我  你甚至都不...
and you're telling me that you won't even...

36:02.220 --> 36:04.330
是的  斯科特  我甚至都不
That's right, Scott. I won't even.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.210
我做不到
I can't.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.710
妈妈让我来救你
Mommy told me to come and save you.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.430
干得好  你救下我了
Good job. I'm saved.

36:15.190 --> 36:17.240
我真希望你们是来问我其他事的
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.430
什么都行
Anything else.

36:18.490 --> 36:20.240
我真的很高兴见到你们  我只是...
I'm honestly happy to see you guys, I just...

36:20.240 --> 36:21.530
对了  我们准备了六人份的午餐
Oh, look, the table's set for six.

36:21.530 --> 36:23.350
托尼  我懂
Tony. I get it.

36:23.580 --> 36:25.640
我为你高兴  真的
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

36:26.620 --> 36:28.440
但这是我们的第二次机会
But this is a second chance.

36:28.790 --> 36:30.900
我的第二次机会就在这儿呢  队长
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.650
我不能拿她冒险
Can't roll the dice on it.

36:35.050 --> 36:37.070
只要不谈工作  你们可以留下来用午餐
If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.410
他害怕了
Well, he's scared.

36:41.890 --> 36:43.000
他没有错
He's not wrong.

36:43.430 --> 36:45.220
是啊  但是  我们该怎么办
Yeah, but, I mean, what are we, what are we, what are we gonna do?

36:45.220 --> 36:46.960
我们需要他  我们就这么放弃吗
We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

36:47.600 --> 36:49.330
不  我想把这事做好
No, I wanna do it right.

36:52.860 --> 36:54.550
我们需要一个大大脑
We're gonna need a really big brain.

36:55.570 --> 36:56.510
比他的还大吗
Bigger than his?

36:57.570 --> 36:59.110
别这样  怎么好像就我一个人在吃
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating here.

36:59.110 --> 37:00.180
尝尝那个
Try some of that.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.640
来点炒蛋
Have some eggs.

37:01.910 --> 37:03.200
我好困惑
I'm so confused.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.730
现在就是令人困惑的年代
These are confusing times.

37:04.910 --> 37:06.910
是啊  不  不  我不是那个意思
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant.

37:06.910 --> 37:10.020
我懂啦  我开玩笑的
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

37:10.290 --> 37:11.940
我知道  这很疯狂
I know, it's crazy.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.540
我都开始穿衬衫了
I'm wearing shirts now.

37:13.540 --> 37:16.780
是啊  什么  怎么会  为什么
Yeah. What? How? Why?

37:16.840 --> 37:19.280
五年前  我们惨败
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.340
只不过我更惨
Except it was worse for me...

37:21.340 --> 37:22.840
因为我输了两次
'cause I lost twice.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.160
先是绿巨人输了  后来班纳又输了
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

37:25.600 --> 37:27.010
再后来  我们都输了
and then, we all lost.

37:27.010 --> 37:28.560
没人怪你  布鲁斯
No one blamed you, Bruce.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.460
我怪
I did.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.940
这么多年来  我一直把绿巨人
For years, I've been treating the Hulk

37:32.940 --> 37:34.270
当成一种疾病
like he's some kind of disease...

37:34.270 --> 37:35.460
一种需要摆脱的东西
something to get rid of.

37:36.440 --> 37:39.220
但后来  我开始视他为出路
But then, I start looking at him as the cure.

37:39.610 --> 37:41.860
我在伽马实验室待了18个月
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.560
把思想和力量融为了一体
I put the brains and the brawn together...

37:44.620 --> 37:46.310
现在看看我
and now, look at me.

37:46.870 --> 37:48.810
两个自我的最佳状态
Best of both worlds.

37:48.870 --> 37:50.660
-打扰一下  绿巨人先生  -什么事
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk? - Yes.

37:50.660 --> 37:52.150
我们能跟你合影吗
Can we get a photo?

37:52.210 --> 37:54.370
当然可以  小朋友
100%, little person.

37:54.380 --> 37:56.610
来  站过来  能帮个忙吗
Come on, step on up. Do you mind?

37:57.210 --> 37:58.650
-当然  -谢谢
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Thanks.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.360
说"绿"
Say "Green."

38:00.800 --> 38:03.380
-绿  -绿
- Green. - Green.

38:47.340 --> 38:49.540
时间旅行重来一次的事
The whole time travel do-over?

38:51.140 --> 38:54.590
各位  这不是我专长的领域
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.210

那是她创造的  是她的专属词
She coined it. It belongs to her.

40:29.910 --> 40:30.910
你怎么还不睡
Why are you up?

40:30.910 --> 40:32.910
因为我还有大事要做
'Cause I've got some important shit going on here!

40:32.910 --> 40:33.660

快睡觉  不然我把你玩具全卖了
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

41:35.050 --> 41:36.120

41:52.860 --> 41:54.820
关于堆肥的书
Just a book on composting.

堆肥有什么新门道
What's new with composting?

41:58.040 --> 42:00.060
-有趣的科学...  -我想出来了
- Interesting science... - I figured it out.

42:01.080 --> 42:01.940

By the way.

42:03.170 --> 42:05.940
我们是在聊同一件事吗
And, you know, just so we're talking about the same thing...

42:06.630 --> 42:07.740
时间旅行
Time travel.

42:09.090 --> 42:10.030
什么
What?

42:16.850 --> 42:17.830

42:18.930 --> 42:20.710
太惊人了

42:21.310 --> 42:22.420
也很可怕
terrifying.

42:40.490 --> 42:41.990
看来你可以
Sorta seems like you can.

42:42.000 --> 42:42.980
除非我停手

42:44.670 --> 42:47.440
我可以马上收手不干
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

42:48.290 --> 42:49.110
托尼

42:50.050 --> 42:51.700
劝你收手
trying to get you to stop...

42:51.710 --> 42:54.570

42:58.800 --> 43:00.620
我有几分觉得  我该把它
Something tells me I should put it in a

43:01.600 --> 43:04.040
锁进盒子里  沉进湖底
lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake...

43:05.520 --> 43:06.670
然后上床睡觉
and go to bed.

43:13.030 --> 43:15.140
但你能安心睡着吗
But would you be able to rest?

43:19.830 --> 43:22.810

Good, because if we blow the grid,

43:34.720 --> 43:38.340
我可不想把小不点丢在上世纪五十年代
I don't want to lose, uh, Tiny here in the 1950s.

43:38.340 --> 43:41.080
-你说什么  -他在开玩笑呢
- Excuse me? - He's kidding.

43:41.220 --> 43:42.680

I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here.

43:51.360 --> 43:53.680
要么就是玩笑  要么就是玩完
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

然后10秒后带你回来
then bring you back in 10 seconds.

44:03.370 --> 44:04.480
懂吗
Make sense?

44:04.700 --> 44:06.120
完全明白
Perfectly not confusing.

This doesn't feel right.

44:30.480 --> 44:31.760
当然是了
Yes, it's Scott.

44:34.570 --> 44:36.900
-怎么回事  布鲁斯  -我的背
- What's going on, Bruce? - Oh, my back!

44:36.900 --> 44:38.110
-这又怎么回事  -等等的
- What is this? - Hold on a second.

44:38.110 --> 44:39.360
-能让让吗  -当然
- Could I get a little space here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:39.360 --> 44:40.450
你能把他变回来吗
Can you bring him back?

44:40.450 --> 44:41.600
我在努力呢
I'm working on it.

44:48.790 --> 44:49.540
是个婴儿
It's a baby.

44:49.540 --> 44:51.370

44:51.380 --> 44:52.960
-他会长大的  -把斯科特变回来
- He'll grow. - Bring Scott back.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.630
我说断电时  就断电
When I say kill the power, kill the power.

44:54.630 --> 44:55.610
天呐
Oh, my God.

44:56.550 --> 44:58.240
准备...断电
And... kill it!

45:02.300 --> 45:04.160
有人尿在我裤子里了
Somebody peed my pants.

45:04.260 --> 45:05.300
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

45:05.310 --> 45:08.710
但我不确定是婴儿的我  还是老年的我
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me.

45:11.900 --> 45:14.150
还是就是我
Or just me me.

45:14.150 --> 45:15.630
时间旅行啊
Time travel!

45:19.360 --> 45:20.220

45:21.860 --> 45:24.310
我觉得这绝对是成功啊
I see this as an absolute win.

46:09.910 --> 46:11.100
干吗拉个脸

46:11.250 --> 46:13.020
我猜猜  他变成婴儿了
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

46:14.250 --> 46:16.330
还不止  对  你怎么来了
Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?

46:16.340 --> 46:18.190
是爱波罗悖论
It's the EPR Paradox.

46:18.590 --> 46:19.880
你们没能让朗在时间里移动
Instead of pushing Lang through time,

46:19.880 --> 46:22.210
而是让时间在朗身上流动了
you might've wound up pushing time through Lang.

46:22.220 --> 46:23.090
这很不好弄 很危险
It's tricky, dangerous.

46:23.090 --> 46:25.080
真该有人提醒你注意的
Somebody could have cautioned you against it.

46:25.260 --> 46:26.200
你提醒了
You did.

46:26.550 --> 46:27.620
是吗
Oh, did I?

46:27.760 --> 46:29.790
幸好我来了
Well, thank God I'm here.

46:30.270 --> 46:32.170
不管怎样  我解决了

46:32.890 --> 46:35.420
完全好用的时间空间定位仪
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

46:37.310 --> 46:38.670

46:40.110 --> 46:43.050
原来怨恨会腐蚀心灵 我讨厌它
Turns out resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.

46:43.860 --> 46:44.680
我也是
Me, too.

46:46.450 --> 46:47.700
我们有机会拿到宝石
We got a shot at getting these stones,

46:47.700 --> 46:49.890
但我得告诉你我最看重什么
but I gotta tell you my priorities.

46:49.950 --> 46:52.440
找回我们失去的  希望可以
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes.

46:52.540 --> 46:55.360
留住我得到的  我必须  不惜一切
Keep what I found, I have to, at all costs.

46:56.630 --> 46:59.150
或许  不用杀身成仁
And maybe not die trying.

46:59.460 --> 47:00.570
那样最好了
Would be nice.

47:03.010 --> 47:04.120
听上去不错
Sounds like a deal.

47:27.780 --> 47:28.740
托尼  这好吗
Tony, I don't know.

47:28.740 --> 47:29.640

Why?

47:30.530 --> 47:31.560
这是他为你造的
He made it for you.

47:32.540 --> 47:34.410
而且  说实在的  我得赶紧从车库里取出来
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage

47:34.410 --> 47:36.310
不然要被摩根拿去滑着玩了
before Morgan takes it sledding.

47:41.670 --> 47:42.780
谢谢  托尼
Thank you, Tony.

47:43.670 --> 47:45.320
你能别声张吗
Will you keep that a little quiet?

47:46.050 --> 47:47.700
我可没给全队都带礼物来
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

47:49.140 --> 47:52.370
是全队都来吧
We are getting the whole team, yeah?

47:52.850 --> 47:54.420
我们正在集结人手呢
We're working on that right now.

48:12.490 --> 48:13.810
人类
Hey, Humie.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.690
大绿呢
Where's Big Green?

48:16.160 --> 48:18.270
在厨房里吧
The kitchen, I think.

48:19.580 --> 48:20.610
好赞啊
That's awesome.

48:21.960 --> 48:24.150
罗德  降落时小心
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

48:24.170 --> 48:26.110
降落区有个白痴
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

48:26.970 --> 48:28.320
天呐
Oh, God.

48:28.760 --> 48:30.740
好啊  普通大小的哥们
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

49:00.220 --> 49:06.290
<b>欢迎来到新阿斯加德  请慢速行驶</b>

49:21.690 --> 49:23.810
跟金宫殿  魔法锤比
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces

49:23.810 --> 49:25.980
差远了啊
and the magic hammers and whatnot.

49:25.980 --> 49:27.610
有点同情心嘛  伙计
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

49:27.610 --> 49:29.820
他们先失去了阿斯加德  然后又失去了半数人民
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people.

49:29.820 --> 49:31.450
他们大概有个家就很开心了
They're probably just happy to have a home.

49:31.450 --> 49:33.100
你们不该来的
You shouldn't have come.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.410
女武神
Valkyrie!

49:36.410 --> 49:39.190
见到你真高兴  生气姑娘
Great to see you, angry girl!

49:39.410 --> 49:42.230
我觉得你另外两个形态哪个都比这样好
I think I liked you better either of the other ways.

49:42.710 --> 49:43.620
这是火箭
This is Rocket.

49:43.630 --> 49:44.480
你好
How ya doing?

49:47.170 --> 49:48.320
他不会见你们的
He won't see you.

49:48.420 --> 49:49.670
那么糟吗
It's that bad, huh?

49:49.670 --> 49:50.970
我们每月只能见到他一次
We only see him once a month

49:50.970 --> 49:54.700
在他来取"补给"时
when he comes in for "supplies."

49:52.300 --> 49:54.090
<b>啤酒</b>

49:55.180 --> 49:56.220
那么糟啊
It's that bad.

49:56.220 --> 49:57.120
是啊
Yeah.

50:10.150 --> 50:11.300
搞什么
What the...?

50:14.450 --> 50:16.390
这里面一股腐臭
Something died in here!

50:17.240 --> 50:19.560
有人吗  托尔
Hello? Thor!

50:20.040 --> 50:21.850
你是来修电视的吗
Are you here about the cable?

50:22.290 --> 50:24.770
电影频道两周前收不到了
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago and...

50:25.000 --> 50:27.990
体育频道也都模模糊糊的
the sports are all kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

50:28.590 --> 50:29.530
托尔
Thor?

50:37.550 --> 50:40.420
伙计们  天呐
Boys! Oh, my God!

50:40.890 --> 50:43.710
天呐  见到你们太好了
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!

50:44.140 --> 50:46.340
过来  你这可爱的小坏蛋
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.840
别了  别介了
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

50:49.520 --> 50:50.650
真没必要
That's not necessary.

50:50.650 --> 50:53.400
绿巨人  你认识我的朋友米克和寇格吧
Hulk, you know my friends Miek and Korg, right?

50:53.400 --> 50:54.860
-你们好  -你们好
- Hey, boys! - Hey, guys.

50:54.860 --> 50:56.200
好久没见
Long time no see.

50:56.200 --> 50:57.240
啤酒在桶里
Beer's in the bucket.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.820
有无线网  自己登吧
Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.

50:58.830 --> 51:00.730
没有密码的
No password, obviously.

51:01.450 --> 51:02.940
托尔  他又来了
Thor, he's back.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.520
电视上那小子刚刚又喊我蠢货了
That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again.

51:06.210 --> 51:07.860
新手大师
Noobmaster.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.750
对  新手大师69
Yeah, NoobMaster69

51:09.750 --> 51:11.450
-喊我蠢货  -我受够了
- called me a dickhead. - I am sick of this.

51:12.210 --> 51:13.960
新手大师  还是托尔
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again.

51:13.970 --> 51:15.340
雷神哦
You know, the God of Thunder.

51:15.340 --> 51:17.430
听着  伙计  如果你不马上退出游戏
Listen, buddy, if you don't log off this game immediately,

51:17.430 --> 51:19.090
我就飞去你家
I am gonna fly over to your house,

51:19.100 --> 51:21.100
冲进你正躲在的地下室里
come down to that basement you're hiding in,

51:21.100 --> 51:23.790
扯掉你的胳膊  塞进你屁眼里
rip off your arms, and shove them up your butt!

51:23.850 --> 51:24.890
没错
Oh, that's right, yes!

51:24.890 --> 51:27.210
去你爸那儿哭吧  小混蛋
Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

51:27.730 --> 51:28.560
谢谢  托尔
Thank you, Thor.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.230
他再敢挑衅你就告诉我  好吗
Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

51:30.230 --> 51:31.920
非常感谢  我会的
Thank you very much. I will.

51:32.400 --> 51:33.940
你们想喝点啥吗  我们喝什么
So, you guys want a drink? What are we drinking?

51:33.940 --> 51:36.640
我有啤酒  龙舌兰  什么都有
I've got beer, tequila, all sorts of things.

51:39.320 --> 51:40.180
伙计
Buddy.

51:41.080 --> 51:43.440
-你没事吧  -嗯  我没事  怎么了
- You all right? - Yes, I'm fine. Why?

51:43.540 --> 51:45.040
我看上去不好吗
Why, don't I look all right?

51:45.040 --> 51:46.650
你看上去像融化的冰淇淋
You look like melted ice cream.

51:48.420 --> 51:50.740
怎么  你就是来玩的吗
So, what's up? You just here for a hang, or what?

51:50.840 --> 51:52.070
我们需要你帮忙
We need your help.

51:52.840 --> 51:55.380
我们或许有机会修复一切
There might be a chance we could fix everything.

51:55.380 --> 51:56.820
电视吗
What, like the cable?

51:56.970 --> 51:59.220
因为这事折磨我几周了
'Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.

51:59.220 --> 52:00.450
是灭霸
Like Thanos.

52:19.490 --> 52:22.560
别提那个名字
Don't say that name.

52:22.950 --> 52:26.190
是啊  我们这里不提那个名字的
Yeah, we don't actually say that name in here.

52:30.920 --> 52:33.030
请把你的手拿开
Please take your hand off me.

52:35.800 --> 52:39.450
我知道那...家伙
Now, I know that guy...

52:40.140 --> 52:41.450
可能让你害怕
might scare you.

52:41.590 --> 52:42.750
怎么会呢
Why would I be...?

52:43.220 --> 52:46.000
我怎么会怕那家伙
Why would I be scared of that guy?

52:46.310 --> 52:48.580
是我杀了那家伙  记得吗
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember?

52:49.390 --> 52:51.380
这里有别人杀他了吗
Anyone else here kill that guy?

52:54.900 --> 52:55.760
没有
Nope.

52:56.610 --> 52:57.970
我猜也是
Didn't think so.

52:58.490 --> 53:00.560
寇格  你跟大家说说
Korg, why don't you, uh, tell everybody

53:00.740 --> 53:03.020
是谁砍掉了灭霸的大脑袋
who chopped Thanos' big head off?

53:03.280 --> 53:04.280
风暴斧吗
Stormbreaker?

53:04.280 --> 53:06.390
那是谁挥的风暴斧
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

53:10.290 --> 53:12.670
我懂的  你心情很难过
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?

53:12.670 --> 53:13.880
我也经历过
I've been there myself.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.700
知道是谁帮我走出来的吗
And you want to know who helped me out of it?

53:15.750 --> 53:18.700
是娜塔莎吗
Was it Natasha?

53:19.010 --> 53:20.410
是你
It was you.

53:21.220 --> 53:22.540
是你帮了我
You helped me.

53:24.300 --> 53:26.210
那你怎么不去问问
So, why don't you ask...

53:26.850 --> 53:29.040
下面的阿斯加德人
the Asgardians down there...

53:29.480 --> 53:31.130
我的帮助有多少价值
how much my help is worth?

53:36.730 --> 53:38.590
至少是还剩下的那些
The ones that are left, anyway.

53:38.610 --> 53:40.430
我觉得我们能把他们找回来
I think we could bring them back.

53:40.900 --> 53:42.140
住口
Stop.

53:43.110 --> 53:44.520
别说了  好吗
Stop, okay?

53:45.160 --> 53:46.240
我知道你觉得我是待在这里
I know you think I'm down here

53:46.240 --> 53:48.200
沉湎于自怨自艾之中
wallowing in my own self-pity...

53:48.200 --> 53:50.830
等着有人来拯救
waiting to be rescued and saved...

53:50.830 --> 53:53.210
但我没事  好吗  我们都没事  是吧
but I'm fine, okay. We're fine, aren't we?

53:53.210 --> 53:54.210
我们很好  伙计
Oh, we're good here, mate.

53:54.210 --> 53:56.880
所以  不管你有什么提议  我们不感兴趣
So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it.

53:56.880 --> 53:58.610
不在乎  完全不在乎
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

53:58.760 --> 53:59.660
再见
Goodbye.

54:03.090 --> 54:04.370
我们需要你  伙计
We need you, pal.

54:14.270 --> 54:15.760
船上有啤酒
There's beer on the ship.

54:20.360 --> 54:21.430
哪种的
What kind?

54:25.700 --> 54:28.410
东京

54:34.580 --> 54:36.280
是他  他来杀昭彦了

55:03.490 --> 55:05.220
你为什么要这么做

55:07.280 --> 55:09.410
我们跟你无冤无仇

55:09.410 --> 55:10.940
你们还活着

55:11.080 --> 55:12.900
半个地球的人却死了

55:13.160 --> 55:14.860
他们因灭霸而死

55:15.170 --> 55:16.480
你会死在我手里

55:21.550 --> 55:24.740
他们再别想伤害谁了

55:24.800 --> 55:25.990
我们伤害人

55:30.260 --> 55:31.620
你真是疯了

55:52.160 --> 55:53.040
去死吧

55:58.750 --> 55:59.610
等等

56:01.460 --> 56:02.740
救我

56:03.960 --> 56:05.410
你想要什么我都给你

56:06.760 --> 56:08.180
你想要什么

56:08.180 --> 56:09.200
我想要的
What I want

56:10.390 --> 56:11.660
你给不了
you can't give me.

56:35.330 --> 56:36.560
你不该来的
You shouldn't be here.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.230
你也不该
Neither should you.

56:46.970 --> 56:48.410
我有工作要做
I've got a job to do.

56:50.010 --> 56:51.540
你管这叫工作吗
Is that what you're calling this?

56:52.680 --> 56:55.040
杀这些人也不能让你的家人回来
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.

57:00.940 --> 57:02.210
我们有发现
We found something.

57:03.730 --> 57:05.680
或许是一线希望
A chance, maybe.

57:09.240 --> 57:10.010
别
Don't.

57:11.320 --> 57:12.310
别什么
Don't what?

57:15.660 --> 57:16.890
别给我希望
Don't give me hope.

57:20.790 --> 57:22.690
很抱歉我没能早点给你
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

57:44.730 --> 57:45.880
你往左偏了
You're drifting left.

57:46.480 --> 57:48.130
小心点  督爷
One side there, Lebowski.

57:51.400 --> 57:52.680
火贱  干得怎么样了
Ratchet, how's it going?

57:52.780 --> 57:53.820
是火箭
It's Rocket.

57:53.820 --> 57:56.980
你放尊敬点  你只在地球上是天才  伙计
Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

58:01.410 --> 58:03.270
时间旅行服  不赖啊
Time travel suit, not bad.

58:05.080 --> 58:06.080
小心点
Easy! Easy!

58:06.090 --> 58:07.210
我很小心了
I'm being very careful.

58:07.210 --> 58:08.840
不  你很绿巨人
No, you're being very Hulky.

58:08.840 --> 58:09.630
我很小心了
I'm being careful.

58:09.630 --> 58:11.300
这可是皮姆粒子
These are Pym Particles, all right?

58:11.300 --> 58:13.510
因为汉克·皮姆已被响指打消失了
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence,

58:13.510 --> 58:14.130
我们只剩这些了
this is it.

58:14.140 --> 58:16.220
我们只有这么多  我们再造不出更多了
This is what we have. We're not making any more.

58:16.220 --> 58:18.250
-斯科特  冷静  -抱歉
- Scott, calm down. - Sorry.

58:18.390 --> 58:21.350
我们只够每人往返一次  再就没了
We've got enough for one round-trip each. That's it.

58:21.350 --> 58:22.350
不能重来
No do-overs.

58:22.350 --> 58:24.590
还能做两次测试
Plus two test runs.

58:29.070 --> 58:30.300
一次测试
One test run.

58:31.110 --> 58:33.030
好吧  我没准备好呢
All right. I'm not ready for this.

58:33.030 --> 58:33.850
我愿意
I'm game.

58:36.530 --> 58:37.390
我去吧
I'll do it.

58:38.740 --> 58:39.900
克林特  你会因时移
Clint, now you're gonna feel

58:39.900 --> 58:41.750
而感到有些混乱
a little discombobulated from the chronoshift.

58:41.750 --> 58:42.410
不用担心的
Don't worry about that.

58:42.410 --> 58:44.040
等等  我问你件事
Wait, wait, wait a second. Let me ask you something.

58:44.040 --> 58:45.440
如果我们能做到
If we can do this, you know...

58:45.670 --> 58:48.210
回到过去  何不去找到婴儿灭霸
go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos?

58:48.210 --> 58:49.030
然后...
You know, and...

58:53.380 --> 58:54.880
首先  这太黑暗了
First of all, that's horrible.

58:54.880 --> 58:55.590
那是灭霸啊
It's Thanos.

58:55.590 --> 58:57.930
其次  时间不是那样的
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.

58:57.930 --> 59:00.350
改变过去不能改变未来
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

59:00.350 --> 59:01.850
我们回到过去  赶在灭霸之前
Look, we go back, we get the stones

59:01.850 --> 59:03.230
拿到宝石
before Thanos gets them...

59:03.230 --> 59:05.940
灭霸就拿不到宝石了  问题解决
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.

59:05.940 --> 59:07.940
-是啊  -原理不是这样的
- Bingo. - That's not how it works.

59:07.940 --> 59:08.980
我听说是这样的
Well, that's what I heard.

59:08.980 --> 59:10.320
谁  谁说的
Wait, but who? Who told you that?

59:10.320 --> 59:12.530
《星际迷航》《终结者》《时间警察》
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

59:12.530 --> 59:14.030
-《两世奇人》  -《量子跳跃》
- Time After Time. - Quantum Leap.

59:14.030 --> 59:15.280
《时间的皱折》《时光倒流七十年》
Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.

59:15.280 --> 59:16.110
《热浴盆时光机》
Hot Tub Time Machine.

59:16.110 --> 59:17.410
《热浴盆时光机》
Hot Tub Time Machine.

59:17.410 --> 59:18.820
《比尔和泰德历险记》
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

59:18.830 --> 59:21.410
基本上所有讲时间旅行的电影都是这样的
Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.

59:21.410 --> 59:23.160
《虎胆龙威》  不对  那个不是
Die Hard. No, that's not one.

59:23.160 --> 59:24.200
这是已知定律
This is known.

59:24.210 --> 59:25.710
我不知道为什么大家都相信那个
I don't know why everyone believes that,

59:25.710 --> 59:26.750
但那不是真的
but that isn't true.

59:26.750 --> 59:29.040
想想看  如果你回到过去
Think about it. If you travel to the past...

59:29.040 --> 59:31.210
那过去就是你的未来了
that past becomes your future...

59:31.210 --> 59:34.590
你之前的现在  就成了过去
and your former present becomes the past...

59:34.590 --> 59:37.220
它是不能被你的新未来改变的
which can't now be changed by your new future.

59:37.220 --> 59:38.290
没错
Exactly.

59:39.180 --> 59:41.540
所以《回到未来》就是胡扯吗
So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?

59:46.270 --> 59:47.550
好  克林特
All right, Clint.

59:48.020 --> 59:51.010
准备  三  二
We're going in three, two...

59:51.360 --> 59:52.220
一
one.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.920
库珀
Cooper?

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.880
-我的耳机呢  -莱拉
- Where are my headphones? - Lila?

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.480
-我没拿  -莱拉
- I never had them. - Lila?

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.590
你昨天拿了
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:15.880
莱拉  莱拉
Lila! Lila!

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.220
怎么了  爸爸
Yeah, Dad?

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.850
爸爸
Dad?

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.690
莱拉
Lila!

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:39.300
看着我
Look at me.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.120
你没事吧
You okay?

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:41.990
没事
Yeah.

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:43.450
没事
Yeah.

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.790
成功了
It worked.

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:48.750
成功了
It worked.

所以  我们刚好能去的地方不多  是吧
So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

以太粒子  首先  它不是宝石
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.600
之前有人把它称为宝石
Someone called it a stone before.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.900
它更像是团愤怒的烂泥
It's more of an angry sludge sort of a thing, so

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.790
得有人纠正一下
someone's gonna need to amend that

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.200
别再那么喊它了
and stop saying that.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.170
关于以太粒子  有个有趣的故事
Here's an interesting story, though, about the Aether.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.180

是啊  简是我的老情人
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.760
她有次把手伸进了一块石头里
You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time...

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.890
以太粒子就自己进入了她体内
and then the Aether stuck itself inside her...

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:29.950
她就病得很重
and she became very, very sick.

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:31.910
我不得不把她带回阿斯加德
And so I had to take her to Asgard,

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:33.160

which is where I'm from...

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.960
我们只能想办法治好她
and we had to try and fix her.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.460
我们当时在约会
We were dating at the time, you see...

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.940
我还把她介绍给了我妈妈
and I got to introduce her to my mother...

who's dead and, um...

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:49.550
然后简和我也分手了
Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, so...

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:51.220

Yes, these things happen, though. You know?

I think I'm having a panic attack.

01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:46.390
-过来  -我不该来的
- Come here. - I shouldn't be here.

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:47.330
-这里  -这不妙
- Right here. - This is bad.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.680
你以为只有你失去了人吗
You think you're the only one who lost people?

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.370
你以为我们在干什么
What do you think we're doing here?

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.680
我失去了我唯一曾拥有过的家庭
I lost the only family I ever had.

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:56.650
奎尔  格鲁特  德拉克斯  触角妹
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna...

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:57.760
都没了
all gone.

01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:00.270
我理解你想你妈妈
I get you miss your mom...

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.780
但她死了
but she's gone.

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:02.940
真死了
Really gone.

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:06.140
但还有很多人只是不在了
And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone...

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.720
你可以帮他们
and you can help them.

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:09.950
所以这个要求过分吗
So, is it too much to ask

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:11.940
把你胡子里的食物渣子掸掉
that you brush the crumbs out of your beard...

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.330
去哄那个漂亮妞
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:17.750
趁她不备  吸走无限宝石
and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone...

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:19.860
然后帮我找回家人
and help me get my family back?

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.780
好
Okay.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.570
你哭了吗
Are you crying?

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:25.030
没有
No.

01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:28.120
对
Yes.

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.680
我觉得我要不行了
I feel like I'm losing it.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.680
振作起来
Get it together!

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.870
你可以的
You can do this.

01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:34.380
你可以的
You can do this.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.460
好吗
All right?

01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:39.880
我可以的
Yes, I can.

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.800
很好
Good.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.430
我可以的
I can do this. I can do this.

01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:47.640
我做不到
I can't do this.

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.660
好了  女人杀手  她现在就一个人
All right, heartbreaker, she's alone.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.890
我们的机会来了
This is our shot.

01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:52.140
托尔
Thor?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.020
托尔
Thor!

01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:00.420
<b>莫格拉</b>

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.950
好  降下来  小蓝
All right, bring it down, Blue.

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:08.120
对准那条线  没错  再往下
Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.600
能快点的吗
Can we hurry it up?

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.790
各位  快点  我们赶时间呢
Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on the clock.

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:19.130
这么催真的很有帮助
All that is really helpful.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:22.550
-要小心  好吗  -嗯
- Take care, okay? - Yeah.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.930
拿到宝石就回来  别干别的
Get that stone and come back. No messing around.

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.450
我们行的
We got this.

01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:28.650

回头见
I'll see you back.

01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:32.730
你们彼此照应着点
You guys watch each other's six.

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:33.640
嗯
Yeah.

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:44.700
沃密尔星球的坐标已输入
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.990
他们只要不跌出来就行
All they have to do is not fall out.

01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:55.870
我们离布达佩斯可很远了
We're a long way from Budapest.

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.380
好吧
Okay, so, uh...

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.110
我们就等着这个奎尔出现
we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:09.220
然后他就会带我们找到力量宝石  是吗
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:11.470
我们找掩护吧
Let's take cover.

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:15.580
2014年时  我们不是唯一在找宝石的人
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.200
等等  你在说什么呢
Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now?

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:18.810
还有谁在找宝石
Who else is looking for these stones?

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.110
我父亲
My father...

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:24.740
我姐姐
my sister...

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:26.660
和我
and me.

01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:27.990
还有你
And you?

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:31.240
你现在在哪
Where are you right now?

01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:01.360
不客气
You're welcome.

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.860
我没叫你帮忙
I didn't ask for your help.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.650
但你总需要我帮
And yet, you always need it.

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:12.550
起来  父亲要我们回飞船上
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:13.280
为什么
Why?

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:15.540
他找到了一颗无限宝石
He's found an Infinity Stone.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:20.750
在哪
Where?

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.590
在一颗叫莫格拉的星球上
On a planet called Morag.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.090
父亲的计划总算开始运作了
Father's plan is finally in motion.

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:29.070
一颗宝石可不比六颗  星云
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:30.300
这是个开始
It's a start.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.600
如果他能拿到全部...
If he gets all of them...

01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:47.210
罗南已找到了力量宝石
Ronan's located the Power Stone.

01:14:47.210 --> 01:14:49.090
我要派你们去他的飞船上
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:50.530
他不会高兴的
He won't like that.

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:52.660
他不配合就得死
His alternative is death.

01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:55.830
罗南的执迷
Ronan's obsession...

01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.830
影响了他的判断力
clouds his judgment.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.250
我们不会让你失望的  父亲
We will not fail you, Father.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.840
是啊  你不会的
No, you won't.

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:12.300
我发誓
I swear...

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.560
我会让你骄傲的
I will make you proud.

01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:27.290
我们就等着这个奎尔出现
...we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:29.360
然后他就会带我们找到力量宝石  是吗
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:31.530
我们找掩护吧
Let's take cover.

01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:36.030
2014年时  我们不是唯一在找宝石的人
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

01:15:38.010 --> 01:15:39.120
那是谁
Who was that?

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:40.350
我不知道
I don't know.

01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:42.710
我头痛欲裂  我不知道
My head is splitting. I don't know.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.380
她的突触驱动可能在打斗中损伤了
Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.

01:15:57.610 --> 01:15:59.310
把她带上我的飞船
Bring her to my ship.

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:08.120
快点吧  队长
Better hustle, Cap.

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.040
这边看上去像是快要完事了
Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.200
收到  我正在往电梯去
Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.

01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:20.250
如果你们不介意
If it's all the same to you...

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.250
我现在想来一杯
I'll have that drink now.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.040
好  把他拉起来
All right, get him on his feet.

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:28.880
我们稍后再傻站着摆姿势吧
We can all stand around posing up a storm later.

01:16:29.190 --> 01:16:31.090
对了  你们可以收拾一下
By the way, feel free to clean up.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.940
罗杰斯先生  我差点忘了  那身战衣
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that that suit...

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.740
太不衬你的屁股了
did nothing for your ass.

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.190
你非得看吗  托尼
No one asked you to look, Tony.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:37.780
真荒唐
It's ridiculous.

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:39.260
我觉得你很帅  队长
I think you look great, Cap.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.280
在我看来  那就是美国屁股
As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.120
魔杖归谁
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.850
突击队正在赶来收走它
S.T.R.I.K.E. Team's coming to secure it.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.820
那个交给我们吧
We can take that off your hands.

01:16:58.260 --> 01:16:59.530
请吧
By all means.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.830
小心哦
Careful with that thing.

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:04.970
是啊  除非你想被抹除思想
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased.

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:06.100
而且可不好玩
And not in a fun way.

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.310
我们一定小心
We promise to be careful.

01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:08.310
他们是谁
Who are these guys?

01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:09.880
他们是神盾局的
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:13.110
但其实是九头蛇的  但我们当时不知道
Well, actually Hydra, but we didn't know that yet.

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:14.920
真的吗  你们不知道
Seriously? You didn't? I mean,

01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:17.030
他们一看就不像好人啊
they look like bad guys.

01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:18.780
你虽然个头小  但好聒噪
You're small, but you're talking loud.

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:20.700
这就下去协调搜救工作
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.990
这就下去协调搜救工作
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:25.660

I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:26.980
闭嘴
Shut up.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.160
好  该你上了  小伙计
All right, you're up, little buddy.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.650

There's our stone.

01:17:31.210 --> 01:17:32.230

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:33.650
弹我
Flick me.

01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:48.670
让开
Move.

01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:50.730
伙计
Buddy!

01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:53.100
你怎么想的  已达到承载上限了
What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:53.770
走楼梯吧
Take the stairs.

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:55.880
是啊  别别
Yeah. Stop, stop.

01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:01.510
"走楼梯"  讨厌楼梯
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.660
好了  队长  权杖在电梯里
All right, Cap, I got our scepter in the elevator...

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:09.770
刚过80层

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.610

我们收到消息  可能有人会企图偷它
We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.

01:18:58.170 --> 01:18:59.200
抱歉  队长
Sorry, Cap.

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.450
我们不能把权杖给你
We can't give you the scepter.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.780

对  我桌子里常备一罐应急的  放松啦

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:57.350
可以专心点吗
Can we focus, please?

01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:58.880
我要进入你了
I'm going inside you...

01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:00.470
行动

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.130
不  他得向我们做交待
No, he's going to answer to us.

01:20:21.130 --> 01:20:22.340
我们审过了再给奥丁
Odin can have what's left.

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:23.700
我还要拿走那个箱子
And I'm gonna need that case.

01:20:24.010 --> 01:20:25.840
那七十多年来都是神盾局的财产
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D. property for over 70 years.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.160
交出箱子  斯塔克
Hand over the case, Stark.

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.400
好  行动吧  精灵鼠小弟
All right, move it, Stuart Little.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.540
这边情况有点麻烦了  快点的
Things are getting dicey out here. Let's go.

01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:31.850
我不打算争论这里谁的权力更高
I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here...

01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:33.370
你保证你不会死吗
You promise me you won't die?

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:36.600
我们只是要让我稍稍心律失常
We're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.170
那听上去很暴力啊
That doesn't sound mild.

01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:39.100
我需要那个箱子
I need the case.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.650
我知道你权力挺大的  我只是说
I know you got a lot of pull, I'm just saying,

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:41.900
-管辖权...  -好吧  那给我箱子
- jurisdiction... - Okay, then give me the case.

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:42.940
管辖权...
Well, jurisdiction...

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:44.380
交出来
Hand it over.

01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:45.480
动手  朗
Do it, Lang!

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:46.280
手拿开
Get your hands off me.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.180
快没时间了  拔线
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.600
来了
Here goes!

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.140
-斯塔克  -斯塔克
- Stark? - Stark?

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.790
他在抽搐  给他点空间
He's convulsing. Give him air!

01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:58.520
-医务人员  -医务人员
- Medic! - Medic!

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.320
他们需要帮助
Give these guys some help.

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:01.730
说话啊
Speak to me.

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:04.240
斯塔克  是你的胸口机器吗
Stark, is it your chest machine?

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.200
呼吸
Breathe, breathe.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.600
好样的  巷子里见
Good job. Meet me in the alley.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.000
我去找点吃的
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.760
不走楼梯
No stairs!

01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:32.610
拜托  斯塔克  保持清醒
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.530
我要试个办法  好吗
I'm going to try something. Okay?

01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:34.890
我也不知道行不行
I have no idea if it's going to work.

01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:38.080
好啊
Yes!

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.310
非常行啊
That worked a treat.

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:40.460
哥们  真疯狂
Dude, that was so crazy.

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.980
我完全不知道那行不行
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:43.900
-箱子呢  -箱子
- The case. - The case is, uh...

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:46.400
箱子呢  洛基呢
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:48.070
洛基
Loki!

01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:49.510
那不符合计划  是吧
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:50.740
我们搞砸了
Oh, we blew it.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.370
洛基
Loki?

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.120
托尼  怎么回事
Tony, what's going on?

01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:58.370
告诉我你找到魔方了
Tell me you found that Cube.

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.380
开什么玩笑
You gotta be shitting me.

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:09.300
看到洛基了  14楼
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.600
我不是洛基
I'm not Loki...

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.850
我也不想伤害你
and I don't wanna hurt you.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.920
我可以和你耗一整天
I can do this all day.

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.070
我知道
Yeah, I know.

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.400
我知道
I know.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.690
你从哪拿到的
Where did you get this?

01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:14.420
巴基
Bucky

01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:15.240
还
is

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.410
活着
alive.

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:20.790
什么
What?

01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:37.600
确实是美国屁股
That is America's ass.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:42.790
拜托了
Please, please.

01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:45.060
对不起  我帮不了你  布鲁斯
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.250
如果我交出时间宝石
If I give up the Time Stone

01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:49.460
帮助你的现实  就是毁了我的现实
to help your reality, I'm dooming my own.

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:51.000
恕我直言
With all due respect, all right...

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.370
我觉得科学并不支持你这个说法
I'm not sure the science really supports that.

01:23:59.930 --> 01:24:01.390
无限宝石
The Infinity Stones

01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:04.250
创造了你所感知的时间流
create what you experience as the flow of time.

01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:06.040
如果拿走一颗宝石
Remove one of the stones...

01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:07.960
就会产生支流
and that flow splits.

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.800
这或许对你的现实有好处
Now, this may benefit your reality...

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:13.510
但对我新的这个  就不好了
but my new one, not so much.

01:24:13.530 --> 01:24:15.610
在这个新的支流现实里
In this new branch reality...

01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:17.150
没有了我们对抗
without our chief weapon

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.890
黑暗力量的首要武器
against the forces of darkness...

01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:20.950
我们的世界会被颠覆
our world would be overrun.

01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:22.690
数百万人会蒙受灾难
Millions will suffer.

01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:24.440
告诉我  博士
So, tell me, Doctor.

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.120
你的科学能阻止这一切吗
Can your science prevent all that?

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.020
不能
No...

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.380
但我们可以抹除它
but we can erase it.

01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:32.170
因为我们用完宝石后
Because once we're done with the stones...

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:34.420
我们可以把每一颗拿回原来的时间点
we can return each one to its own timeline...

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:36.050
放回被拿走的那一刻
at the moment it was taken.

01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:38.450
这样  从时间上讲
So, chronologically...

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.500
在那个现实里
in that reality...

01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:44.620
它就根本没被拿走过
it never left.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.170
是啊  但你漏掉了最重要的部分
Yes, but you're leaving out the most important part.

01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:56.690
要还回宝石  你们得能幸存下来
In order to return the stones, you have to survive.

01:24:56.690 --> 01:24:59.640
我们会的  我会的  我保证
We will. I will. I promise.

01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:02.600
我不能为了一句承诺拿这个现实冒险
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:06.540
至尊法师有责任
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:08.560
保护时间宝石
to protect the Time Stone.

01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:11.150
那斯特兰奇为什么把它交了出去
Then why the hell did Strange give it away?

01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:13.750
你说什么
What did you say?

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:16.700
斯特兰奇  他把宝石交给了灭霸
Strange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.660
-自愿的吗  -是的
- Willingly? - Yes.

01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:24.100
-为什么  -我不知道
- Why? - I have no idea.

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:25.660
或许他错了
Maybe he made a mistake.

01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:37.430
或是我错了
Or I did.

01:25:57.590 --> 01:26:00.120
斯特兰奇将成为我们中最优秀的
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:02.990
所以他那么做肯定是有原因的
So, he must've done it for a reason.

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.410
你恐怕是对的
I fear you might be right.

01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:11.130
谢谢
Thank you.

01:26:17.610 --> 01:26:19.470
我指望你了  布鲁斯
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.510
我们都指望你了
We all are.

01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:44.620
运行诊断
Run diagnostics.

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:46.910
给我看她的记忆文件
Show me her memory file.

01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:51.460
大人  文件似乎凌乱了
Sire, the file appears entangled.

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.630
虽然有段记忆  但不属于她
It was a memory, but not hers.

01:26:55.690 --> 01:26:58.380
还有另一个意识在与她共享网络
There's another consciousness sharing her network.

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.470
另一个星云
Another Nebula.

01:27:02.530 --> 01:27:03.850
不可能
Impossible.

01:27:04.110 --> 01:27:06.680
这个二重身有时间戳
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:09.690
是九年后的
from nine years in the future.

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.780
另一个星云在哪
Where is this other Nebula?

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:20.320
在我们太阳系里的莫格拉上
In our solar system on Morag.

01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:22.550
你能读取她吗
Can you access her?

01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:24.370
能  她俩是相连的
Yes, the two are linked.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.950
搜索那个二重身的记忆
Search the duplicate's memories...

01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:29.290
找无限宝石
for Infinity Stones.

01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:34.020
而这些宝石
And these stones have been

01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:36.230
曾在历史上很多不同的地方出现过
in a lot of different places throughout history.

01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:37.590
我们的历史  所以
Our history. So,

01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:40.190
我们刚好能去的地方不多  是吧
not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:42.400
所以我们得选好目标
Which means we have to pick our targets.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.050
-没错  -定格
- Correct. - Freeze image.

01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:47.390
地球人
Terrans.

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.850
复仇者
Avengers.

01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:52.600
无法无天的讨厌鬼
Unruly wretches.

01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.480
那个倒影是什么
What's that reflection?

01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:57.480
放大它  乌木喉
Amplify this, Maw.

01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:01.740
我不懂
I don't understand.

01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:08.140
两个星云
Two Nebulas.

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.870
不  是一个星云
No. The same Nebula...

01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:13.210
来自两个时间
from two different times.

01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:16.140
设置航向去莫格拉
Set course for Morag.

01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:18.170
并扫描那个二重身的记忆
And scan the duplicate's memories.

01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:21.670
我想看到一切
I wanna see everything.

01:28:31.530 --> 01:28:33.410
女士们  稍后见
My ladies, I'll see you after.

01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:35.190
你们先去吧
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:50.540
你在干什么
What are you doing?

01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:53.390
天呐
Oh, God!

01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:56.020
偷偷摸摸这种事最好还是交给你弟弟
You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.520
我没偷偷摸摸  我就是出来走走
No, I wasn't sneaking. I was just going for a walk.

01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.390
你穿的是什么啊
What are you wearing?

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:02.090
我总穿这件的  我最喜欢了
I always wear this. It's one of my favorites.

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.650
你的眼睛怎么了
What's wrong with your eye?

01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:08.490
我的眼睛
Oh, my eye.

01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:10.780
记得海拉根战役吗
Remember the, uh, Battle of Harokin...

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:13.560
我被大刀击中了脸
when I got hit in the face with the broadsword?

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:20.070
你根本不是我认识的托尔  是吧
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:21.530
我是的
Yes, I am.

01:29:22.670 --> 01:29:25.320
看来未来对你很不好  是吧
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:27.490
我没说我是未来来的
I didn't say I was from the future.

01:29:27.970 --> 01:29:30.120
我是被女巫养大的  孩子
I was raised by witches, boy.

01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:34.120
我看东西不光靠眼睛  你知道的
I see with more than eyes, you know that.

01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:38.310
是啊  我就是从未来来的
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:40.310
是啊  亲爱的
Yes, you are, honey.

01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:42.000
我真的需要跟你谈谈
I really need to talk to you.

01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:43.050
我们可以谈谈
We can talk.

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:08.990
他的脑袋在这边
His head was over there...

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.330
他的身体在另一边
and his body over there...

01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:15.750
有什么意义呢  我太迟了
I mean, what was the point? I was too late.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.170
我就傻站在那里
I was just standing there.

01:30:19.230 --> 01:30:20.890
一个拿着斧头的白痴
Some idiot with an axe.

01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:23.050
你才不是白痴
Now, you're no idiot.

01:30:23.730 --> 01:30:25.300
你不是来这儿了吗
You're here, aren't you?

01:30:25.570 --> 01:30:28.430
向阿斯加德最睿智的人寻求建议
Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.680
是啊
I am. Yes.

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.050
不是白痴
Idiot, no.

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.760
失败呢
A failure?

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:34.320
的确
Absolutely.

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.570
这有点残忍了吧
That's a little bit harsh.

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:37.390
知道那意味着你什么吗
Do you know what that makes you?

01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:40.480
跟其他人一样
Just like everyone else.

01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:43.230
我不是该与众不同的吗
I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?

01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:47.570
每个人都会辜负他人的期待  托尔
Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be, Thor.

你是来修复你的未来的  不是我的

-这就是关于你的未来  -那我管不着

-二  -不  等等
- Two... - No, wait!

01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:59.120
什么情况啊
What am I looking at?

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.310
有时得需要点时间
Sometimes it takes a second.

01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:11.780
我还有资格
I'm still worthy.

01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:14.660
天呐
Oh, boy.

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:18.490

那是什么
What's that?

01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:13.170
贼的工具
The tool of a thief.

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.330
按说这时候就会有尖刺冒出来
This is the part where you know, spikes come out...

01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:26.950
上面还插着骷髅
with skeletons on the end of them and everything.

01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:27.750
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:29.120
当你闯入什么
When you break into a place called

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.670
"力量宝石神殿"时
"The Temple of the Power Stone"...

01:33:30.670 --> 01:33:32.130
肯定会有一堆陷阱的
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps.

01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:33.990
-天呐  -好吧  行啊  你去吧
- Oh, my God. - Okay. All right. Go ahead.

01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:09.440
我并不一直是如此的
I wasn't always like this.

01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:11.230
我也一样

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.690
但我们只能尽力而为了  是吧
But we work with what we got, right?

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:19.360

三  二  一
Three, two, one.

01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:38.530
你杀了数万亿生灵
You murdered trillions!

01:34:38.530 --> 01:34:40.140
你应该感激

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:43.680

我是宿命
I am inevitable.

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.830

没什么

他们是想撤销我已在
They're trying to undo something

宝石
The stones.

01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.390

我父亲有很多特点

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.990
但他不撒谎
A liar is not one of them.

01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:49.410
谢谢你  女儿
Thank you, daughter.

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.370
也许我过去对你太残酷了

01:35:56.690 --> 01:35:59.420
那就是实现了命运

拉手指放屁

01:41:36.150 --> 01:41:37.260

01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:41.450
你脸色不太好啊  波茨
You look a little green around the gills, there, Potts.

01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:43.350

I'm fine. Just long hours.

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.100
想去呼吸下新鲜空气吗
You wanna get some air?

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.400

01:41:58.510 --> 01:42:00.580
你不是那种垮掉的一代吧  波茨
You're not one of those beatniks, are you, Potts?

01:42:06.930 --> 01:42:08.710

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.220
问题就在这里  先生  我们没法拿
That's the thing, sir, we can't.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:22.060
我不懂  那不是你的工作吗
I'm confused. I thought that was your job.

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.430
就是...
Well, it's just...

01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:24.990
先生  这盒子在发光
Sir, the box is glowing...

01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:26.160
老实说
and to be honest,

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:28.400
几个邮递员也不太舒服
some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great.

01:42:28.450 --> 01:42:30.040
他们没打开它吧
They didn't open it, did they?

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.190

Yeah, they did. You better get down here.

01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.980

恭喜
Congratulations.

01:43:14.210 --> 01:43:16.150
-谢谢  替我拿下  -好
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya? - Yeah, sure.

01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:19.610
-她怀多久了  -不知道
- How far along is she? - I don't know.

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:22.590
反正她现在
She's at the point

01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:24.450
受不了我嚼东西的声音
where she can't stand the sound of my chewing.

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.540
看来我又得去餐具室吃晚饭了
I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again.

01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:30.040
我有个女儿
I have a little girl.

01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:31.420
是女儿就好了
A girl would be nice.

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.000
那样她比较不太可能变成我这样
Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me.

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.900
那有什么不好的
What'd be so awful about that?

01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:37.690
这么说吧  我很少能
Let's just say that the greater good

01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:41.800
把大局放在自利之上
has rarely outweighed my own self-interest.

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.570
你从未见过这两人吗
And you've never seen these two men before?

01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:48.870
没  我眼神很刁的  他俩看上去很可疑
No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.

01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:49.620
可以描述一下吗
Can you describe them?

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.370
其中一个留了嬉皮士胡子
One of them had a hippie beard.

01:43:51.370 --> 01:43:52.910
嬉皮士  是比吉斯乐队还是蒙格·杰里那种
Hippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:54.160
绝对是蒙格·杰里
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:54.910

Yeah, this is Chesler.

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.000
所有可调动宪兵前往地下六层
I need every available MP to sublevel six.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.490

We have a potential breach.

01:44:14.850 --> 01:44:17.770
<b>玛格丽特·卡特局长</b>

01:44:16.230 --> 01:44:17.270
我说叫他们进来
I said bring them in.

01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:18.440
他们在试了  长官
They're trying, ma'am,

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.110
但布拉多克的小队被雷击阻拦了
but Braddock's unit has been stopped by lightning strikes.

01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:21.320

Oh, for the love of...

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:22.800
我会看看天气预报的
I'll look at the weather projections.

01:44:46.930 --> 01:44:49.040
这可不是雷击
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.

01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:02.020
名字想得怎么样了
So, where you at with names?

01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:05.260
如果是男孩  我妻子想叫埃蒙泽
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.300
还是再考虑考虑吧  还有时间呢
Might wanna let that stew awhile. You got time.

01:45:10.410 --> 01:45:11.600
我问问你
Let me ask you a question.

01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:14.100
你孩子出生时
When your kid was born,

01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:16.200
你紧张吗
were you nervous?

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:17.060
可紧张了
Wildly.

01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:19.620
-是啊  -你觉得自己够格吗
- Yeah. - Did you feel qualified?

01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:21.500
你知道
Like you had any idea

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.540
要怎么成功操作那玩意吗
how to successfully operate that thing?

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:26.590
我真的是一边干一边学的
I literally pieced it together as I went along.

01:45:26.590 --> 01:45:28.830
我回想了我爸爸是怎么做的
I thought about what my dad did.

01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:32.250
我老爸  他什么问题都用皮带解决
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:34.350
我以前觉得我爸爸对我很严厉
I thought my dad was tough on me.

01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:35.640
而如今回想起来
And now, looking back on it,

01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.040
我只记得那些美好的回忆
I just remember the good stuff.

01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:39.090
他偶尔也说过些金句
You know? He did drop the odd pearl.

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:40.630
是吗  比如呢
Yeah? Like what?

01:45:41.610 --> 01:45:44.130
"千金难买寸光阴"
"No amount of money ever bought a second of time."

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.630
他很睿智
Smart guy.

01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:48.140
他尽力了
He did his best.

01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.310
我跟你说  那孩子还没出生
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet

01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:53.390
我已经愿意为他付出一切了
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:03.360
很高兴认识你  波茨
Good to meet you, Potts.

01:46:04.590 --> 01:46:05.610

你好弱
You're weak.

你想知道他对你做了什么吗
You wanna know what he does to you?

01:47:26.710 --> 01:47:27.740
够了
That's enough.

01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:42.040
你让我恶心
You disgust me.

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.590
但这不代表你毫无用处
But that doesn't mean you're useless.

01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.200
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

01:48:13.630 --> 01:48:16.210
<b>沃密尔星球</b>

这本会很赞的
this would be totally awesome.

01:48:37.450 --> 01:48:39.600
我敢说那浣熊不用爬山
I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain.

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.450
严格说  他也不是浣熊
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know?

01:48:42.450 --> 01:48:44.190
随便  反正他吃垃圾
Whatever. He eats garbage.

要得到灵魂宝石
In order to take the stone...

01:49:55.190 --> 01:49:57.800
你必须失去自己的珍爱之物

01:49:59.650 --> 01:50:02.310
永恒的交换

I don't think so.

为什么  就因为他知道你爸爸的名字吗
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name?

01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:28.370
连我都不知道
I didn't.

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.540
灭霸带着灵魂宝石离开了这里
Thanos left here with the stone...

01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:34.420
却没带走他女儿
without his daughter.

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.260
那不是巧合
That's not a coincidence.

01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:38.680
的确
Yeah.

01:50:41.070 --> 01:50:42.600

Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.

01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:05.040
我想是的
I guess we do.

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:14.800
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.800
我们想的不是一个人  娜塔莎
we mean different people here, Natasha.

For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing.

一切都是为了此刻  让所有人复生
That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.

不  你别在这时候跟我装伟大
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:28.140

What, you think I wanna do it?

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:30.990
我是在救你的命  傻瓜
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.150
可我不想让你救  行吗
Yeah, well, I don't want you to. How's that?

01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:36.190

Natasha, you know what I've done.

01:51:38.250 --> 01:51:39.740
你知道我已变成了什么样的人
You know what I've become.

01:51:42.050 --> 01:51:44.700
我不会以一个人最糟糕的错误来评判他
I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.

01:51:48.930 --> 01:51:50.040
或许你应该这样
Maybe you should.

01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:52.120

你自己告诉他们
You tell 'em yourself.

01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:03.240
该死的
Damn you.

01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:11.290

Wait.

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:20.630

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:30.890
没事的
It's okay.

01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:34.770
别
Please.

01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:37.480
不要
No!

01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:20.420
我们都拿到了吗
Did we get 'em all?

01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:23.380
你是说真成功了吗
Are you telling me this actually worked?

01:55:28.230 --> 01:55:29.430
克林特  小娜呢
Clint, where's Nat?

01:55:58.810 --> 01:56:00.250
她有家人吗
Do we know if she had family?

01:56:00.810 --> 01:56:01.620
有
Yeah.

01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:03.170
我们
Us.

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:05.340
什么
What?

01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:08.900
-你干什么  -就是问他个问题
- What are you doing? - Just asked him a question.

01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:10.270
不  你们都一副她已经死了的样子
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:11.360
我们为什么一副她已经死了的样子
Why are we acting like she's dead?

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:12.800
我们有宝石啊
We have the stones, right?

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:14.530
只要我们有宝石  队长
As long as we have the stones, Cap,

01:56:14.530 --> 01:56:15.650
我们能复活她的  是吧
we can bring her back. Isn't that right?

01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:18.160
别垂头丧气的了  我们是复仇者  振作起来
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers. Get it together.

01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:19.390
不能复活她
Can't get her back.

01:56:22.330 --> 01:56:23.790
他说什么...什么
What's he...? What?

01:56:23.790 --> 01:56:25.110
不能撤销
It can't be undone.

01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:26.610
不能
It can't.

01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.210
对不起  别介意
Look, I'm sorry, no offense, but

01:56:31.210 --> 01:56:33.000
但你就是个地球人  好吗
you're a very earthly being, okay?

01:56:33.010 --> 01:56:34.590
这可是太空魔法
And we're talking about space magic.

01:56:34.590 --> 01:56:36.600
"不能"也太绝对了  不是吗
And "can't" seems very definitive. Don't you think?

01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.640
我知道这远超我的水平
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my pay grade here.

01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.290
但她还是不在  是吧
But she still isn't here, is she?

01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:42.510
我就是这意思
No, that's my point.

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:45.170
是不能撤销的
It can't be undone.

01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:46.560
至少
Or that's at least

01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:49.020
那个飘着的红人是这么说的
what the red, floating guy had to say.

01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:50.690
或许你该去跟他谈谈
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?

01:56:50.690 --> 01:56:54.090
你去拿上锤子  飞过去  跟他谈谈
Go grab your hammer and you go fly and you talk to him.

01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.560
本该是我的
It was supposed to be me.

01:57:06.710 --> 01:57:09.080
她为了那颗宝石牺牲了生命
She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:10.570
她赌上了性命
She bet her life on it.

01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:17.160
她回不来了
She's not coming back.

01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:21.410
我们不能让她白死
We have to make it worth it.

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:22.790
绝对不能
We have to.

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:25.500
不会的
We will.

01:57:57.630 --> 01:57:59.120
好  手套准备好了
All right, the glove's ready.

01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:02.660
问题是  谁来打指响
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:04.080
我来
I'll do it.

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:05.350
-什么  -没事
- Excuse me? - It's okay.

01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:07.000
-不不  -打住  别急
- No, no, no. - Stop, stop. Slow down.

01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:08.480
托尔  等等
Thor. Just wait.

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:10.540
我们还没决定由谁来戴
We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet.

01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.690
不好意思  难道我们还要干坐着
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting around

01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:14.150
等待合适时机吗
waiting for the right opportunity?

01:58:14.150 --> 01:58:15.440
我们至少该谈谈
We should at least discuss it.

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:17.280
坐在这里盯着它看
Look, sitting here staring at the thing

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:19.140
是不会让大家复活的
is not gonna bring everybody back.

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:21.700
我是最强的复仇者  好吗
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?

01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:23.450
所以这责任该由我来担
So, this responsibility falls upon me.

01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:24.660
-一般来说  你是对的  -这是我的责任
- Normally, you're right. - It's my duty.

01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:25.740
-但那不是重点  -不是那个
- It's not about that. - It's not that.

01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:28.480
-伙计  -住口  让我来吧
- Hey, buddy... - Stop it! Just let me.

01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:32.940
让我来吧
Just let me do it.

01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:35.290
让我做件好事  做件对的事
Just let me do something good. Something right.

01:58:35.290 --> 01:58:36.840
这不光是因为
Look, it's not just the fact that

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.510
那只手套所承载的能量
that glove is channeling enough energy

01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:39.420
足以点亮一个大陆
to light up a continent.

01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:41.550
相信我  你的状态不行
I'm telling you. You're in no condition.

01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:44.890
你以为我现在血管里流的是什么
What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?

01:58:44.890 --> 01:58:45.950
奶酪吗
Cheez Whiz?

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:49.350
雷电
Lightning.

01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:50.680
-是啊  -雷电
- Yeah. - Lightning.

01:58:50.690 --> 01:58:52.380
雷电也帮不了你  伙计
Lightning won't help you, pal.

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:53.750
得由我来
It's gotta be me.

01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:57.840
你们看到宝石对灭霸的伤害了
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

01:58:57.900 --> 01:58:59.180
他差点没命
They almost killed him.

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:02.930
你们都撑不住的
None of you could survive.

01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:04.810
我们怎么知道你撑得住
How do we know you will?

01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:06.350
我们不知道
We don't.

01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:08.940
但辐射主要就是伽马射线
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

01:59:12.580 --> 01:59:13.980
就好像
It's like...

01:59:16.170 --> 01:59:17.780
我是为此而诞生的
I was made for this.

01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:38.380
可以了吗
Good to go, yeah?

01:59:40.570 --> 01:59:41.590
开始吧
Let's do it.

01:59:42.030 --> 01:59:42.940
好  记住
Okay, remember,

01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:44.740
五年前被灭霸的指响打没的人
everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago

01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:47.140
你把他们带回来  回到现在  今天来
you're just bringing them back to now, today.

01:59:47.530 --> 01:59:49.560
别改变过去五年里的任何事
Don't change anything from the last five years.

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:51.270
好的
Got it.

02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:09.050
星期五  帮个忙
Friday, do me a favor

02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:10.850
启动谷仓门协议  好吗
and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:11.870
是  老板
Yes, boss.

02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:22.300
大家回家吧
Everybody comes home.

02:00:45.970 --> 02:00:47.420
摘掉
Take it off! Take it off!

02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:49.080
不  等等  布鲁斯  你没事吧
No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:51.000
说话  班纳
Talk to me, Banner.

02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:55.540
我没事
I'm okay.

02:00:55.890 --> 02:00:56.750
我没事
I'm okay.

02:01:01.770 --> 02:01:02.810
<b>传送门开启  源点2014年</b>

02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:29.280
布鲁斯
Bruce!

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:32.250
别碰他
Don't move him.

02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:42.420
-成功了吗  -我们不确定  没事的
- Did it work? - We're not sure. It's okay.

02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:20.350
<b>劳拉</b>

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:29.260
亲爱的
Honey.

02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:30.180
克林特
Clint?

02:02:30.490 --> 02:02:31.310
亲爱的
Honey.

02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:33.600
各位
Guys...

02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:38.100
好像成功了
I think it worked.

02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:22.360
我无法呼吸了
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:25.480
脱罩
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

02:03:32.130 --> 02:03:33.990
罗德  火箭  快出去
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

02:03:34.930 --> 02:03:36.620
放我出去
Let me up! Let me up!

02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:38.040
快点
Come on!

02:03:48.230 --> 02:03:49.260
罗德
Rhodey!

02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:59.280
求救  有人收到吗
Mayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy?

02:03:59.290 --> 02:04:00.660
我们在下层  淹水了
We're on the lower level. It's flooding!

02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:02.310
什么
What? What?

02:04:02.370 --> 02:04:04.830
我们要淹死了  有人收到吗  求救
We are drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:07.070
等等  我在
Wait! I'm here!

02:04:07.330 --> 02:04:08.860
我在  收到了吗
I'm here. Can you hear me?

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:29.510
队长
Cap?

02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:56.950
好吧
Okay.

02:05:14.190 --> 02:05:15.140
女儿
Daughter.

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:16.510
是  父亲
Yes, Father.

02:05:18.530 --> 02:05:20.430
这就是未来
So, this is the future.

02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:21.930
好样的
Well done.

02:05:22.530 --> 02:05:23.850
谢谢  父亲
Thank you, Father.

02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:25.690
他们毫未怀疑
They suspected nothing.

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:29.520
自大者总是如此
The arrogant never do.

02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:33.150
去
Go.

02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:36.870
找到宝石  拿给我
Find the stones, bring them to me.

02:05:37.010 --> 02:05:38.330
你要做什么
What will you do?

02:05:40.050 --> 02:05:41.240
等着
Wait.

02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:08.270
告诉我
Tell me something.

02:06:09.710 --> 02:06:11.020
在未来
In the future...

02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:14.030
你和我怎么样了
what happens to you and me?

02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:17.860
我企图杀你
I try to kill you.

02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:21.240
好几次
Several times.

02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:23.620
但最终
But eventually...

02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:25.790
我们成了朋友
we become friends.

02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:29.540
我们成了姐妹
We become sisters.

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.300
来吧
Come on.

02:06:40.570 --> 02:06:41.810
我们可以阻止他
We can stop him.

02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:51.730
拜托  伙计  醒醒
Come on, buddy, wake up!

02:06:52.330 --> 02:06:53.400
这就对了
That's my man.

02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:57.240
你再弄丢  我可就不还你了
You lose this again, I'm keeping it.

02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:01.410
怎么回事
What happened?

02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:03.740
你扰乱时间  时间就给你捣乱
You mess with time, it tends to mess back.

02:07:03.930 --> 02:07:04.910
你会明白的
You'll see.

02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:28.060
他都干什么了
What's he been doing?

02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.520
什么都没干
Absolutely nothing.

02:07:33.370 --> 02:07:34.900
宝石呢
Where are the stones?

02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:37.190
在这堆东西下面
Somewhere under all this.

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:40.450
我只知道他没拿到
All I know is he doesn't have 'em.

02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:42.800
那就别让他拿到
So, we keep it that way.

02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:44.530
你们知道这是陷阱吧
You know it's a trap, right?

02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:45.660
知道
Yeah.

02:07:46.050 --> 02:07:47.330
我不怎么在乎
I don't much care.

02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:49.080
很好
Good.

02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:52.830
只要我们都达成一致就行
Just as long as we're all in agreement.

02:08:02.690 --> 02:08:04.510
我们这次要好好杀了他
Let's kill him properly this time.

02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:16.520
你们无法承受自己的失败
You could not live with your own failure.

02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:19.740
结果如何呢
Where did that bring you?

02:08:23.130 --> 02:08:24.160
又跟我碰面了
Back to me.

02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:31.120
我本以为抹除了一半的生命
I thought by eliminating half of life...

02:08:31.850 --> 02:08:34.000
另一半就能兴旺
the other half would thrive.

02:08:34.690 --> 02:08:36.130
但你们让我知道
But you've shown me...

02:08:37.150 --> 02:08:38.670
那是不可能的
that's impossible.

02:08:40.770 --> 02:08:44.010
只要还有人记得曾经
And as long as there are those that remember what was...

02:08:44.110 --> 02:08:45.610
就总会有人
there will always be those

02:08:45.610 --> 02:08:49.220
无法接受可能的未来
that are unable to accept what can be.

02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:51.600
他们会抵抗
They will resist.

02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:53.770
对  我们就那么固执
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:56.020
我很感激
I'm thankful.

02:08:58.420 --> 02:08:59.780
因为现在
Because now...

02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:02.200
我知道我该怎么办了
I know what I must do.

02:09:03.090 --> 02:09:08.120
我要粉碎全宇宙  化为原子
I will shred this universe down to its last atom.

02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:10.290
然后
And then...

02:09:10.930 --> 02:09:13.420
再用你们替我收集的宝石
with the stones you've collected for me...

02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:15.460
创造个新宇宙
create a new one...

02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:17.960
充满生机
teeming with life...

02:09:18.650 --> 02:09:20.480
它不会知道自己失去了什么
that knows not what it has lost...

02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:22.590
只知道它被赋予了什么
but only what it has been given.

02:09:26.150 --> 02:09:27.930
一个感恩的宇宙
A grateful universe.

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:29.610
从鲜血中诞生
Born out of blood.

02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:31.020
他们不会知道的
They'll never know it.

02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:34.810
因为你活不到那时告诉他们
Because you won't be alive to tell them.

02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:51.750
另一边见了  伙计
See you on the other side, man.

02:09:53.810 --> 02:09:55.670
撑着  我来了
Hang on! I'm coming!

02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.880

我认识你

02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:52.260
什么
What?

02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:54.740
住手
Stop.

02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:01.240
你要背叛我们
You're betraying us?

02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:08.750
你不用这么做的
You don't have to do this.

02:11:11.410 --> 02:11:14.070
我就是这样
I am this.

02:11:14.170 --> 02:11:16.020
不  你不是
No, you're not.

02:11:16.540 --> 02:11:17.930
你看到我们变成什么样了
You've seen what we become.

02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:25.950
星云  听她的
Nebula, listen to her.

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.340
你可以改变的
You can change.

02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:36.900
他不会允许的
He won't let me.

02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:39.890
不要
No!

02:11:59.170 --> 02:12:00.910
好  托尔  来吧
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:18.390
老板  醒醒
Boss, wake up!

02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:10.870
我就知道
I knew it!

02:14:33.770 --> 02:14:35.770
我南征北战这么多年
In all my years of conquest...

02:14:37.610 --> 02:14:38.640
暴力
violence...

02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:41.510
屠戮
slaughter...

02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:44.860
从来不是出于私怨
it was never personal.

02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:49.940
但告诉你们
But I'll tell you now...

02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:55.350
我马上要对你们顽固讨厌的
what I'm about to do to your stubborn,

02:14:56.260 --> 02:14:58.000
小星球做的事
annoying little planet...

02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:01.830
我会非常
I'm gonna enjoy it...

02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:05.070
享受其中的
very, very much.

02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:10.900
队长  收到吗
Hey, Cap, you read me?

02:16:17.150 --> 02:16:18.800
队长  我是山姆  收到吗
Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?

02:16:23.490 --> 02:16:24.530
在你左边
On your left.

02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:51.620
就这些人了吗
Is that everyone?

02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:53.360
什么  你还嫌不够吗
What? You wanted more?

02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:21.980
复仇者
Avengers...

02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:28.630
集结
assemble.

02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:05.040
死吧
Die!

02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:27.140
不  那个给我
No, no, give me that.

02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:28.360
你拿那个小的
You have the little one.

02:19:44.430 --> 02:19:45.410
我去
Holy cow!

02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:46.660
你不会相信都发生了什么的
You will not believe what's been going on.

02:19:46.660 --> 02:19:48.300
还记得我们在太空里时吗
Do you remember when we were in space?

02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:49.690
我化成灰了
And I got all dusty?

02:19:49.690 --> 02:19:50.700
我肯定是昏了过去
And I must've passed out,

02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:52.280
因为我醒来时  你不在了
because I woke up and you were gone.

02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:54.270
但斯特兰奇博士在  他说
But Doctor Strange was there, right? And he was like...

02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:55.860
"已经过去五年了  快走  他们需要我们"
"It's been five years. Come on, they need us."

02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:57.560
然后他就开始画那个亮亮的黄圈
And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing

02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:58.820
-就他老做的那个  -是吗
- that he does all the time. - He did? Oh, no.

02:19:58.820 --> 02:19:59.760
你在干什么
What are you doing?

02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:06.270
感觉好棒
Oh, this is nice.

02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:29.660
卡魔拉
Gamora?

02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:40.150
我以为我失去了你
I thought I lost you.

02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:47.700
别  碰  我
Don't touch me!

02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:52.470
你第一次没打中
You missed the first time.

02:20:53.220 --> 02:20:55.290
然后第二次你一下踢中了俩
Then you got 'em both the second time.

02:20:57.300 --> 02:20:58.280
就是他吗
This is the one?

02:20:58.360 --> 02:20:59.400
不是吧
Seriously?

02:20:59.670 --> 02:21:01.890
你只能在他和一棵树之间选择
Your choices were him or a tree.

02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:13.430
队长
Cap!

02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:15.230
你要我怎么处理这玩意啊
What do you want me to do with this damn thing?

02:21:18.060 --> 02:21:20.050
把那些宝石拿得越远越好
Get those stones as far away as possible!

02:21:20.220 --> 02:21:21.130
不
No!

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:24.620
我们还得把它们送回原处
We need to get 'em back where they came from.

02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:25.410
没法送回去了
No way to get 'em back.

02:21:25.410 --> 02:21:27.050
灭霸毁了量子隧道
Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:28.190
等等
Hold on!

02:21:30.020 --> 02:21:31.720
那不是唯一的时间机器
That wasn't our only time machine.

02:21:38.170 --> 02:21:40.240
有人看到一辆丑爆了的棕色货车了吗
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

02:21:40.610 --> 02:21:41.510
看到了
Yes!

02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:43.510
但你不会喜欢它停车的地方的
But you're not gonna like where it's parked!

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:46.110
斯科特  你启动它需要多久
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:48.380
大概10分钟
Maybe 10 minutes.

02:21:48.380 --> 02:21:50.180
去启动机器  我们把宝石送去给你
Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.

02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:51.230
好的  队长
We're on it, Cap.

02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:04.990
你说是一千四百万之一的概率能赢  是吧
You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah?

02:22:06.910 --> 02:22:07.970
就是这次吧
Tell me this is it.

02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:09.680
如果我告诉你会发生什么
If I tell you what happens...

02:22:10.370 --> 02:22:11.410
就不会发生了
it won't happen.

02:22:15.250 --> 02:22:16.220
你最好是对的
You better be right.

02:22:24.570 --> 02:22:25.890
后面好乱
It's a mess back here.

02:22:27.310 --> 02:22:28.310
没反应
It's dead.

02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:30.210
-什么  -没反应
- What? - It's dead.

02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:31.990
我得热启动试试
I have to hot-wire it.

02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:36.270
星云呢
Where's Nebula?

02:22:37.380 --> 02:22:38.820
她没回应
She's not responding.

02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:40.250
大人
Sire...

02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:51.190
克林特
Clint!

02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:54.820
给我
Give it to me.

02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:20.350
你夺走了我的一切
You took everything from me.

02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:22.660
我都不知道你是谁
I don't even know who you are.

02:23:23.390 --> 02:23:24.360
你会知道的
You will.

02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:48.160
交给我
I got it!

02:23:50.940 --> 02:23:52.410
启动击杀功能
Activate Instant Kill.

02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:16.860
全力轰炸
Rain fire!

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:19.500
但大人  我们的部队
But, sire, our troops!

02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:20.940
照办
Just do it!

02:24:42.170 --> 02:24:43.530
有人看到了吗
Is anyone else seeing this?

02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:58.710
我行的
I got this!

02:24:59.000 --> 02:24:59.930
我行的
I got this.

02:24:59.930 --> 02:25:01.130
好吧  我不行了
Okay, I don't got this.

02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:02.490
救命  谁救救我
Help, somebody help!

02:25:02.490 --> 02:25:04.500

认识你很高兴
Nice to meet you...

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:21.720
老天爷啊
Oh, my God!

02:25:58.800 --> 02:25:59.950
怎么回事
What the hell is this?

02:26:00.890 --> 02:26:01.960
星期五  他们在冲什么开火
Friday, what are they firing at?

02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:04.010
有什么刚进入了上层大气
Something just entered the upper atmosphere.

02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:19.210
好样的
Oh, yeah!

02:26:39.430 --> 02:26:41.810
丹弗斯  我们这里需要帮助
Danvers, we need an assist here.

02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:53.030
我是彼得·帕克
I'm Peter Parker.

02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:54.900
彼得·帕克
Hey, Peter Parker.

02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:56.470
你有什么要给我吗
You got something for me?

02:27:02.690 --> 02:27:04.490
我不知道你要怎么通过那一关
I don't know how you're gonna get it through all of that.

02:27:06.310 --> 02:27:07.320
别担心
Don't worry.

02:27:08.610 --> 02:27:09.800
她不是一个人
She's got help.

02:29:58.050 --> 02:30:00.760
我是宿命
I am inevitable.

02:30:21.770 --> 02:30:23.000
我
And I...

02:30:24.930 --> 02:30:25.880
是
am...

02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:30.860
钢铁侠
Iron Man.

02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:30.930
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark?

02:32:34.390 --> 02:32:36.420
斯塔克先生  你能听到我吗
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

02:32:37.570 --> 02:32:38.530
我是彼得
It's Peter.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.330
我们赢了  斯塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

02:32:47.830 --> 02:32:49.140
我们赢了  斯塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

02:32:51.780 --> 02:32:53.600
我们赢了  你做到了  先生  你做到了
We won! You did it, sir, you did it.

02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:56.580
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

02:32:56.860 --> 02:32:57.780
托尼
Tony.

02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:13.750
小派
Hey, Pep.

02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:19.780
星期五
Friday?

02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:21.780
生命机能情况危急
Life functions critical.

02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:32.370
托尼
Tony?

02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:34.800
看着我
Look at me.

02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:38.700
我们会没事的
We're gonna be okay.

02:33:44.110 --> 02:33:45.250
你可以休息了
You can rest now.

02:35:31.430 --> 02:35:33.770
大家都想要一个快乐的结局  对吗
Everybody wants a happy ending, right?

02:35:34.470 --> 02:35:36.230
但世事难料
But it doesn't always roll that way.

02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:39.870
也许这次的结局会是快乐的
Maybe this time.

02:35:41.930 --> 02:35:44.120
我希望你们回放这个的时候
I'm hoping if you play this back...

02:35:46.290 --> 02:35:47.590
是在庆祝
it's in celebration.

02:35:48.870 --> 02:35:52.780
我希望家人能够团圆  我希望我们能挽回
I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back.

02:35:52.780 --> 02:35:54.130
这个星球能够回归
And something like a normal version

02:35:54.130 --> 02:35:55.710
还算正常的版本
of the planet has been restored.

02:35:56.650 --> 02:35:58.730
如果真有这种东西的话
If there ever was such a thing.

02:35:59.370 --> 02:36:02.360
天呐  世界真奇妙  宇宙真奇妙
God, what a world. Universe, now.

02:36:03.290 --> 02:36:05.370
如果你十年前跟我说我们并不孤单
If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone...

02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:07.660
而且还热闹到这种程度
let alone to this extent, I mean,

02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:09.100
我倒不会觉得惊讶
I wouldn't have been surprised...

02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:10.610
但谁能想到呢
but come on, who knew?

02:36:11.090 --> 02:36:14.020
轮番登场的史诗般的
The epic forces of darkness and light

02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:15.280
黑暗和光明势力
that have come into play.

02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:17.380
不管是好是坏
And for better or worse...

02:36:17.790 --> 02:36:19.390
这就是将伴随摩根
that's the reality Morgan's gonna

02:36:19.390 --> 02:36:21.040
成长的现实
have to find a way to grow up in.

02:36:25.350 --> 02:36:27.710
所以  我觉得最好录下一段问候
So, I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting,

02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:30.850
以防我英年早逝了
in the case of an untimely death. On my part.

02:36:31.370 --> 02:36:34.030
虽然死亡总是来得太早
Not that death at any time isn't untimely.

02:36:35.370 --> 02:36:37.730
我们明天要尝试的时间旅行
This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow

02:36:37.730 --> 02:36:41.220
真的很难说我们能不能活下来
it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all.

02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:42.270
就是这样
That's the thing.

02:36:44.510 --> 02:36:46.460
但是  做英雄就是如此  不是吗
Then again, that's the hero gig, right?

02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:47.850
结束也是旅程的一部分
Part of the journey is the end.

02:36:49.530 --> 02:36:50.600
我在耍什么疯
What am I even tripping for?

02:36:50.610 --> 02:36:51.690
一切都会
Everything is gonna work out

02:36:51.690 --> 02:36:54.730
如愿以偿的
exactly the way it's supposed to.

02:36:58.430 --> 02:36:59.770
我爱你三千
I love you 3,000.

02:37:20.270 --> 02:37:27.850
<b>托尼·斯塔克有心的证明</b>

02:39:14.910 --> 02:39:16.330
我希望有什么办法
You know, I wish there was a way

02:39:17.390 --> 02:39:18.620
能让她知道
that I could let her know.

02:39:21.290 --> 02:39:22.270
我们胜利了
That we won.

02:39:24.700 --> 02:39:25.650
我们做到了
We did it.

02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:31.080
她知道的
She knows.

02:39:36.850 --> 02:39:37.990
他们俩都知道
They both do.

02:39:47.790 --> 02:39:48.920
你好吗  小姑娘
How you doing, squirt?

02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:50.100
我很好
Good.

02:39:50.100 --> 02:39:51.060
好吗
You good?

02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:52.930
好  你饿了吗
Good. You hungry?

02:39:54.810 --> 02:39:55.710
你想吃什么
What do you want?

02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:57.590
奶酪汉堡
Cheeseburgers.

02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:04.270
你爸爸也喜欢奶酪汉堡
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers.

02:40:05.210 --> 02:40:06.220

02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:26.920
我不确定
I'm not sure.

02:41:27.530 --> 02:41:29.550
千年以来  我第一次
For the first time in a thousand years,

02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:31.360
失去了目标

02:42:06.490 --> 02:42:08.740
你说"当然了"  但你又碰地图了
See, you say, "of course," but then you touch the map.

02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:09.860
这会让人觉得
It makes you think that

02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:11.930
也许你并不明白是我说了算
maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.

02:42:12.130 --> 02:42:14.940
-葵尔  这只是你的不安全感  -葵尔

我就是这么说的
That's what I said.

02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:22.310
你们应该为领袖地位的荣耀一战较高下
You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.

02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:23.440
这样公平
Sounds fair.

02:42:26.410 --> 02:42:28.770
-没必要吧  -没必要
- It's not necessary, okay? - It's not.

是出了差错  还是一切如愿
So, did something go wrong or did something go right?

02:46:01.790 --> 02:46:05.000
我把宝石放回去后  我想着

02:46:06.750 --> 02:46:07.690
要不

02:46:08.470 --> 02:46:12.620
