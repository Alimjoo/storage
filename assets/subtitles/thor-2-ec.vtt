WEBVTT

00:34.230 --> 00:38.470
早在光出现之前 世界是一片黑暗
Long before the birth of light, there was darkness,

00:38.880 --> 00:42.940
那黑暗孕育了黑暗精灵
and from that darkness came the Dark Elves.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.060
一千年前
Millennia ago

00:46.280 --> 00:48.830
最残暴的黑暗精灵 马勒基斯
the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith,

00:48.830 --> 00:51.030
企图将我们的宇宙
sought to transform our universe

00:51.030 --> 00:53.740
重归于无尽黑夜
back into one of eternal night.

00:55.950 --> 00:58.030
要实现这邪恶的计划
Such evil was possible

00:58.160 --> 01:00.130
他必须借助以太粒子的力量
through the power of the Aether,

01:00.770 --> 01:04.240
那是能带来无限毁灭的古老武器
an ancient force of infinite destruction.

01:07.820 --> 01:08.770
马勒基斯

01:08.960 --> 01:10.660
阿斯加德的军队攻来了

01:19.240 --> 01:21.220
阿斯加德的圣军
The noble of armies of Asgard,

01:21.220 --> 01:23.280
在我父亲包尔王的率领下
led by my father, King Bor,

01:23.280 --> 01:26.670
对这些邪恶的生灵发起了伟大的战争
waged a mighty war against these creatures.

01:37.450 --> 01:39.730
派出诅咒战士

01:56.490 --> 01:59.350
九大王国的汇聚渐渐形成
As the nine worlds converged above him

01:59.350 --> 02:03.600
马勒基斯终于可以释放以太粒子
Malekith could at last unleash the Aether.

02:21.950 --> 02:24.840
但阿斯加德从他手上夺走了那武器
But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp.

02:26.310 --> 02:29.470
没了武器 黑暗精灵就此战败
Without it, the Dark Elves fell.

02:43.450 --> 02:45.610
尽管大势已去
With the battle all but lost

02:45.610 --> 02:48.390
马勒基斯仍不惜牺牲他的部下
Malekith sacrificed his own people

02:48.700 --> 02:52.740
妄图与阿斯加德军队同归于尽
in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.650
消灭他们 我们才能生存

02:59.110 --> 03:01.120
这场战争还远没有结束

03:08.730 --> 03:13.840
马勒基斯被击败 以太粒子也被摧毁
Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more.

03:15.470 --> 03:17.640
至少我们以为是这样
Or so we were led to believe...

03:18.640 --> 03:22.230
陛下 是否要摧毁以太粒子
Sire, the Aether, shall we destroy it?

03:22.830 --> 03:27.100
只可惜它的力量太过强大 我们无法摧毁
If only we could, but its power is too great.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.500
将它深埋
Bury it deep.

03:30.590 --> 03:32.920
藏在没人能找到的地方
Somewhere no one will ever find it.

03:44.950 --> 03:49.540
雷神 黑暗世界

04:14.840 --> 04:15.670
洛基
Loki.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.320
你好 母亲
Hello, mother.

04:18.230 --> 04:19.630
你为我骄傲吗
Have I made you proud.

04:20.020 --> 04:22.660
求求你 别让事情变得更糟
Please, don't make this worse.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.950
怎样才算更糟
Define "worse".

04:24.320 --> 04:25.240
够了
Enough!

04:26.140 --> 04:28.090
我要单独跟犯人谈谈
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.800
有何必要如此大惊小怪
I really don't see what all the fuss is about.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.000
你还没认识到你罪行的严重性吗
Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes?

04:48.670 --> 04:53.090
你所到之处 必是战争 毁灭与死亡
Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.730
我是作为仁慈的神去米德加德
I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth

04:55.730 --> 04:57.410
统治地球人民
as a benevolent god,

04:58.710 --> 04:59.910
就像你一样
just like you.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.980
我们不是神
We are not gods.

05:01.980 --> 05:06.000
我们跟人类一样 出生 生活然后死去
We are born, we live, we die, just as humans do.

05:07.610 --> 05:09.460
但是我们能活五千年
Give or take five thousand years.

05:10.120 --> 05:14.130
这一切都是因为你想要王位
All this because Loki desires a throne.

05:14.130 --> 05:15.520
这是我与生俱来的权利
It's my birthright!

05:15.520 --> 05:16.780
你与生俱来的权利
Your birthright

05:17.480 --> 05:18.650
是一出生
was to die...

05:19.510 --> 05:20.740
就死去
as a child!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.350
你本被丢弃在冰冷的岩石上
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

05:26.510 --> 05:28.240
如果不是我当时收留了你
If I had not taken you in

05:28.900 --> 05:31.590
此刻你就不会站在这里憎恨我
you would not be here now to hate me.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.800
如果我该被处死 那发发慈悲
If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake,

05:33.800 --> 05:35.830
赶紧动手吧
just swing it.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.700
我并非不喜欢和你谈话
It's not that I don't love our little talks,

05:38.710 --> 05:39.920
只是…
it's just...

05:41.800 --> 05:42.920
我的确不喜欢
I don't love them.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.950
你还活着 完全是因为弗丽嘉不忍杀你
Frigga is the only reason you are still alive

05:45.950 --> 05:47.520
你以后休想再见她了
and you will never see her again.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.340
你会在地牢里度过余生
You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.

05:55.570 --> 05:56.700
那托尔呢
And what of Thor?

05:58.400 --> 06:01.980
我在牢里关到死 你却要封那个蠢货为王吗
You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?

06:01.980 --> 06:04.940
托尔必须尽力弥补你造成的损害
Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done,

06:05.730 --> 06:08.270
他将恢复九大王国的秩序 之后
he will bring order to the nine Realms and then,

06:08.270 --> 06:11.440
是的 他会成为王
yes, he will be king.

06:15.310 --> 06:18.400
华纳海姆

06:59.320 --> 07:01.510
局面完全在我掌控之中
I've got this completely under control!

07:01.510 --> 07:03.180
难怪四处火光连天
Is that why everything's on fire!

07:27.520 --> 07:28.560
不用谢
You're welcome.

07:50.980 --> 07:52.020
交给你了
All yours.

08:14.830 --> 08:15.550
你好
Hello.

08:18.820 --> 08:20.270
我接受你的投降
I accept your surrender.

08:33.170 --> 08:34.030
还有谁
Anyone else?

08:42.360 --> 08:45.010
也许下次我们该直接拿块头大的下手
Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.300
接下来去哪
Where do we go next?

09:06.180 --> 09:09.770
霍根 九大王国都已基本恢复安宁
Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

09:11.070 --> 09:11.730
你该留下
You should stay here

09:11.740 --> 09:13.590
与你的人民在一起 这也是你心之所向
be with your people where your heart is,

09:13.880 --> 09:15.090
迟点回阿斯加德也无妨
Asgard can wait.

09:16.910 --> 09:18.220
多谢你了
You have my thanks.

09:19.670 --> 09:20.650
我也该谢你
As you have mine.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.220
海姆达尔 可以走了
Heimdall, when you're ready.

09:41.430 --> 09:45.230
阿斯加德

10:12.580 --> 10:13.900
华纳海姆安定了吗
Is Vanaheim secure?

10:14.670 --> 10:16.410
是的 诺恩海姆和里亚也是
As are Nornheim and Ria.

10:16.410 --> 10:18.960
但如果您率军亲征 战事必能更早结束
Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.

10:19.550 --> 10:21.770
你一定把我当成一块面包了
You must think I'm a piece of bread

10:21.780 --> 10:23.960
需要时常涂上甜言蜜语
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

10:24.270 --> 10:25.740
我不是这个意思
That was not my intent.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.790
彩虹桥被毁之后 这是九大王国
For the first time since Bifrost was destroyed,

10:28.790 --> 10:30.390
第一次重归安宁
the Nine Realms are at peace.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.110
他们会因此铭记我们的强大
They're well reminded of our strength

10:33.450 --> 10:37.480
而你也赢得了他们的敬意和我的谢意
and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.

10:38.590 --> 10:39.250
谢谢您
Thank you.

10:40.110 --> 10:44.070
一切都安定了 除了你茫然若失的心
Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.510
这与简·福斯特无关 父王
This isn't about Jane Foster, father.

10:47.510 --> 10:49.380
人类的生命转瞬即逝 不值得挂心
Human lives are fleeting, they're nothing.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.010
你该好好珍惜眼前人
You'd be better served by what lies in front of you.

10:54.130 --> 10:56.240
我说这话 不是以众神之父的身份
I'm telling you this not as the All-father,

10:56.410 --> 10:57.720
而是以父亲的身份
but as your father.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.670
你准备好了 该接掌王位了
You are ready, the time has come for you to take the throne.

11:00.670 --> 11:02.520
去享受庆祝你的胜利吧
Embrace and celebrate what you've won.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.140
与你的将士一起
Join your warriors,

11:04.390 --> 11:07.280
美酒佳肴 举杯同庆
eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

11:08.010 --> 11:10.100
至少也装出点开心的样子
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.500
再来
Another.

12:12.850 --> 12:15.280
你以前会欢庆上好几个星期呢
There was a time when you would celebrate for weeks.

12:17.220 --> 12:19.950
我记得海拉根一战后 你兴致高昂
I remember you celebrated the Battle of Harokin

12:20.400 --> 12:22.960
差点挑起了第二次战役
so much that you nearly started the second.

12:23.390 --> 12:25.030
谁让第一仗那么过瘾呢
Well, the first was so much fun.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.000
跟我喝一杯吧
Take a drink with me.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.530
众神之父今晚不会再派任务给你了吧
Surely the All-father could have no further task for you tonight.

12:36.530 --> 12:38.580
对 可我给自己派了任务
No, this is one I set myself.

12:40.810 --> 12:43.480
我注意到你每晚都会消失
It does not go unnoticed that you disappear each night.

12:44.470 --> 12:45.820
世间有九大王国
There are Nine Realms,

12:46.630 --> 12:49.470
阿斯加德未来的国王不能只盯着其中一个
the future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.500
谢谢你的英勇与谏言 尊贵的希芙小姐
I thank you for your sword and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.

13:05.890 --> 13:08.930
伦 敦

13:23.830 --> 13:25.130
你有什么放不下的事
So what's the story with you?

13:25.660 --> 13:27.680
为什么非得有事 我没什么放不下的事
Why does there have to be a story, there's no story.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.910
我们约会的前十分钟里
You spent the first ten minutes of our date

13:30.200 --> 13:32.650
你都躲在一份只有三道菜的菜单后面
hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it.

13:32.650 --> 13:34.740
你能选的就只有鸡肉 蔬菜或鱼 简
It's either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane.

13:34.740 --> 13:36.430
我猜你有放不下的事
I think there's a story

13:36.850 --> 13:40.330
而那件事是有关一个男人的 对吗
and I'm thinking the story involves a guy?

13:40.840 --> 13:42.330
一言难尽
It's complicated.

13:42.330 --> 13:43.690
他还在你身边吗
Is he still around?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.180
不 他
No, he...

13:46.310 --> 13:47.300
走了
went away.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.330
我也经历过
I've been there.

13:48.810 --> 13:51.260
心爱的人离开是很痛苦的事 不是吗
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

13:51.260 --> 13:54.920
我以前交往过一个女人 她去纽约工作了
I was seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York,

13:55.230 --> 13:57.040
最终感情敌不过距离
eventually the distance killed it.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.740
还有就是…
And...and the fact that she uh...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.740
她一直跟别的男人上床
she kept sleeping with other dudes.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.280
- 不是吧 - 好多呢
- No! - Oh, so many.

14:03.670 --> 14:06.730
你好 能给我们上点红酒吗
Hi. Um...could we get some wine please?

14:06.730 --> 14:07.690
好啊 我也想来点
Sure, I'd love some.

14:07.690 --> 14:09.900
理查德 这是达西
Richard, this is Darcy.

14:10.380 --> 14:11.420
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

14:13.610 --> 14:15.260
你好
Oh, hello.

14:15.270 --> 14:19.210
我去了实验室也就是你妈家
So, I show up to work at the lab/your mom's house,

14:19.210 --> 14:22.820
满心以为会看到你穿着睡衣在屋里晃悠
fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas

14:22.820 --> 14:26.150
吃着冰激凌 念念不忘…那个谁
eating ice cream obsessing about... you know who...

14:26.510 --> 14:29.430
可你居然没有 你穿上了淑女装
But you're not! You're wearing lady clothes,

14:29.430 --> 14:31.240
甚至还洗了澡 对吧 香喷喷的
you even showered, didn't you? You smell good.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.370
有什么事
Is there a point to all this,

14:32.370 --> 14:34.510
你跑到这儿来找我一定有什么要紧事
because there really needs to be a point to all this.

14:34.510 --> 14:35.060
对
Right.

14:36.330 --> 14:38.700
还记得你被你丢在一边的科学仪器吗
You know all that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore?

14:39.430 --> 14:41.190
你现在得开始看了
You might wanna start looking at it again.

14:41.410 --> 14:43.500
我们大老远跑来就是为了这个
This is the reason we came all the way out here.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.670
出故障了
It's malfunctioning.

14:44.670 --> 14:45.960
我也这么觉得
That's what I said.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.710
我也这么做的
That's what I did!

14:48.710 --> 14:50.830
还以为你做事会更科学点
I thought you'd do something a little more scientific.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.500
- 应该没什么问题 - 嗯…
- I'm sure it's nothing. - Yeah, it's...

14:52.500 --> 14:53.850
看起来不像没问题
It doesn't look like nothing.

14:53.850 --> 14:56.660
有点像艾瑞克之前念叨的那些读数
Kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about.

14:56.660 --> 14:59.690
我们的朋友艾瑞克 他有点疯了
Our friend Erik, kind of went banana-balls.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.570
他没兴趣
He's not interested.

15:00.570 --> 15:01.870
- 我有兴趣 - 我也没兴趣
- I'm interested. - I'm not interested.

15:01.870 --> 15:02.900
你可以走了
It's time for you to go now.

15:04.790 --> 15:05.690
好吧
Okay.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.250
短暂但愉快
Short but sweet.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.380
她该吃药了
She needs help.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.260
我还是点份鲈鱼吧
I think I'm gonna have the sea bass.

15:17.260 --> 15:19.400
鲈鱼 嗯 鲈鱼不错
Sea bass. Yeah, sea bass is good.

15:20.340 --> 15:22.830
鲈鱼 鲈鱼 鲈鱼 鲈鱼
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,

15:22.830 --> 15:27.680
鲈鱼 鲈鱼 鲈鱼 鲈鱼…
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass...sea bass. Sea bass...

15:29.050 --> 15:30.600
- 鲈鱼 - 简
- Sea bass. - Jane,

15:31.440 --> 15:32.900
你还是别念叨鲈鱼了
maybe you should stop saying "sea bass"

15:32.900 --> 15:34.510
跟你朋友走吧
and go after your friend.

15:35.140 --> 15:36.240
午餐很愉快
This was so fun.

15:36.470 --> 15:39.200
我就自己在这儿念叨鲈鱼吧
You know, I'll just stay here and say "Sea bass" alone.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.310
我恨你
And I hate you.

15:48.660 --> 15:50.560
怎么了 我都夸他了
What?! I said he was cute.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.350
你还是闭嘴开车吧
Just shut up and drive.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.550
下个路口左转
You need to take the next left.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.200
他是谁
Who's he?

16:05.200 --> 16:06.180
他是我的实习生
He's my intern.

16:06.630 --> 16:07.530
你都有实习生了
You have an intern?

16:07.530 --> 16:08.430
没错
Oh, yeah.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.740
你好 福斯特博士
Hello, Dr. Foster. It's uh...

16:10.740 --> 16:12.760
能与你共事真是太荣幸了
It's such a great honor to be working with you.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.880
好吧 我得打给艾瑞克
Right. I need to call Erik.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.620
右转
Oh, uh...take a right.

16:19.220 --> 16:20.060
再左转
And a left.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.930
在伦敦开车我已经驾轻就熟了
I have totally mastered driving in London.

16:24.940 --> 16:28.520
喂 艾瑞克 还是我 你在哪
Hi, Erik, it's me again. Where are you?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.360
我过来是因为你说你有发现
I came here because you said you were onto something

16:30.360 --> 16:31.580
结果你却消失了
and then you vanish.

16:31.580 --> 16:33.240
我现在在巨石阵
I'm here at Stonehenge,

16:33.240 --> 16:36.640
对今天发生的一则趣闻进行跟踪报道
for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.970
警方于今天上午11点刚过时
The police were called to the scene

16:37.970 --> 16:39.830
接到报警 赶到现场
shortly after 11 a.m. this morning,

16:39.830 --> 16:43.350
一名看似正常的男游客来到这里
after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area

16:43.350 --> 16:45.310
随即开始裸奔
then, decided to strip naked

16:45.310 --> 16:49.050
并举着科学仪器 吓坏了游客
and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment

16:49.050 --> 16:51.550
嘴里喊着他是想救他们
while shouting that he was trying to save them.

16:51.550 --> 16:54.580
此人随后被证实为著名天文物理学家
The man later identified as noted astrophysicist

16:54.580 --> 16:55.750
艾瑞克·塞尔维格博士
Dr. Erik Selvig

16:55.750 --> 16:58.270
他目前已被警方拘留待审
has been called in for questioning by police.

17:00.780 --> 17:02.660
快走 多令人激动啊
Come on, this is exciting!

17:03.200 --> 17:05.240
看 实习生都激动了
Look, the intern is excited.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.030
我叫伊恩
"Ian".

17:06.050 --> 17:07.710
要带上相位表吗
Do you want the phase meter?

17:07.710 --> 17:09.420
- 不要 - 拿上相位表
- No. - Bring the phase meter.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.240
长得像面包机的那个
The toaster-looking thing.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.390
我知道相位表长什么样
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.

17:21.670 --> 17:24.140
这手机的铃声要怎么换
How do I change the ringtone on this thing?

17:24.140 --> 17:26.090
有三个学位的天文物理学家
An astrophysicist with three degrees

17:26.090 --> 17:28.000
应该会自己换铃声
should be able to change her own ringtone.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
为什么要打电话
Why are you calling me?

17:29.010 --> 17:30.040
我不想大喊大叫
I didn't want to shout.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.280
实习生说往这边走
Intern says it's this way.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.360
伊恩 我叫伊恩
"Ian". My name is Ian.

17:47.520 --> 17:51.150
我可不想因为搞个科学被人捅死
I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.

17:51.150 --> 17:52.830
没事的 我们是美国人
It's okay, we're Americans!

17:52.830 --> 17:54.510
这样说他们就会喜欢我们了吗
Is that supposed to make them like us?

17:54.920 --> 17:56.350
他们能把它弄走
They'll make it go away.

17:58.420 --> 17:59.680
只是孩子
Oh, they're kids.

18:00.490 --> 18:01.870
你们是警察吗
Are you the police?

18:02.540 --> 18:06.020
不 我们是科学家 我是
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

18:06.020 --> 18:07.950
- 谢谢 - 我们无意中发现的
- Thanks. - We just found it.

18:10.620 --> 18:11.760
能带我们去看看吗
Can you show us?

18:38.360 --> 18:39.950
这可不太正常
That doesn't seem right.

18:57.890 --> 18:58.820
去哪了
Where'd it go?

19:12.540 --> 19:13.430
这真是…
That's...

19:14.010 --> 19:15.210
太不可思议了
that's incredible.

19:28.910 --> 19:29.920
怎么回事
What happened?

19:30.450 --> 19:33.550
有时候能回来 有时候回不来
Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.

19:36.380 --> 19:39.100
我也想丢个东西 简 把你的鞋给我
I want to throw something. Jane, give me your shoe.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.890
我上次见到这样的读数还是在…
I haven't seen readings like this since...

19:44.440 --> 19:45.440
在…
since...

19:45.440 --> 19:46.460
新墨西哥吗
New Mexico?

19:51.010 --> 19:52.340
什么都别碰
Don't touch anything!

19:55.750 --> 19:56.740
把你的鞋给我
Give me your shoe.

20:18.390 --> 20:20.510
那是车钥匙吗
Were those the car keys?

20:58.810 --> 20:59.920
达西
Darcy!

23:00.600 --> 23:02.860
以太粒子唤醒了我们

23:03.020 --> 23:06.490
天体汇聚又开始了

23:21.270 --> 23:22.530
你来迟了
You're late.

23:24.020 --> 23:27.410
有时欢庆比战斗更累人
Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.

23:27.410 --> 23:29.400
那你一定有一样没做对
Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.340
也许吧
Perhaps.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.860
繁星都还好吗
How fare the stars?

23:33.860 --> 23:35.630
一如既往地闪烁着
Still shining.

23:35.640 --> 23:39.200
我在这儿能看到九个王国和亿万生灵
From here I can see nine realms and ten trillion souls.

23:43.390 --> 23:46.250
记得我跟你说过的天体汇聚吗
Do you recall what I told you of the Convergence?

23:46.250 --> 23:49.430
记得 各个王国连成一线
Yes, the alignment of the worlds.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.330
快要到来了 是吗
It approaches, doesn't it?

23:51.850 --> 23:53.610
这宇宙奇观上一次出现
The universe hasn't seen this marvel

23:53.610 --> 23:55.720
是在我守卫开始之前了
since before my watch began.

23:56.850 --> 23:59.800
很少有人能感觉到 能看到的更少了
Few can sense it, even fewer can see it.

24:01.850 --> 24:03.980
虽然它可能带来危险
But while its effects can be dangerous,

24:04.970 --> 24:07.240
但真是美极了
it is truly beautiful.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.100
我什么也看不到
I see nothing.

24:10.830 --> 24:14.090
也许是因为那不是你想看的美景
Or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek.

24:20.010 --> 24:20.790
她怎么样
How is she?

24:21.470 --> 24:23.350
你的凡人还挺聪明
She's quite clever, your mortal.

24:23.350 --> 24:24.590
她自己还不知道
She doesn't know it yet,

24:24.590 --> 24:26.720
但她也在研究天体汇聚
but she studies the Convergence as well.

24:27.620 --> 24:28.320
甚至…
Even...

24:30.510 --> 24:31.270
怎么了
What?

24:35.020 --> 24:36.070
我看不到她了
I can't see her.

25:16.830 --> 25:17.640
简
Jane!

25:18.940 --> 25:20.440
你去哪了啊
Where the hell were you?

25:20.440 --> 25:22.010
你不会报警了吧
Tell me you didn't call the police!

25:22.020 --> 25:23.250
不然我该怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

25:23.250 --> 25:24.320
别报警啊
Not call the police!

25:24.320 --> 25:25.120
我急疯了
I was freaking out.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.680
你报警 警察就会通知联调局
You call the cops, they tell the Feds,

25:26.680 --> 25:28.490
紧接着神盾局就从天而降
the next thing you know we have S.H.I.E.L.D crawling all over,

25:28.490 --> 25:29.630
把这里变成51区
"Area 51-ing" the place.

25:29.630 --> 25:32.410
- 简 - 我们发现了一个稳定的重力异常场
- Jane! - We had a stable gratification anomaly,

25:32.410 --> 25:33.840
并且能自由进行研究
We had unimpeded access.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.710
我们唯一的竞争对手是十岁的孩子
Our only competition was ten years old!

25:35.710 --> 25:38.510
简 你失踪了五个小时
Jane, you were gone for five hours!

25:38.530 --> 25:39.230
什么
What?

25:46.590 --> 25:47.620
好诡异
That's weird.

26:09.810 --> 26:10.610
总这样
Typical.

26:12.020 --> 26:12.800
简
Jane.

26:15.630 --> 26:18.400
抱歉 我必须确认下你是真的
Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real,

26:18.400 --> 26:19.980
今天真的好诡异
it's been a very strange day.

26:19.980 --> 26:21.410
我是真的 简
Well, I am. Jane what...

26:22.160 --> 26:23.530
你去哪了
Where were you?!

26:23.530 --> 26:24.560
你又去哪了
Where were you?

26:25.330 --> 26:26.890
海姆达尔看不到你
Heimdall could not see you.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.820
我一直在原地等你
I was right here where you left me.

26:28.820 --> 26:31.040
我一直在等你 后来我哭了
I was waiting and then I was crying

26:31.040 --> 26:32.720
再后来我到处去找你
and then I went out looking for you.

26:32.720 --> 26:33.860
你说你会回来的
You said you were coming back.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.820
我知道 但是彩虹桥被毁了
I know, I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.570
九大王国爆发了战乱
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos,

26:38.580 --> 26:41.050
战争肆虐 劫盗成群
wars were raging, marauders were pillaging.

26:41.310 --> 26:43.180
我必须制止杀戮
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

26:44.640 --> 26:48.040
这个理由倒是不坏
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

26:48.450 --> 26:51.670
但我在电视上看见你了 你去了纽约啊
But I saw you on TV, you were...you were in New York!

26:52.070 --> 26:54.710
简 我那时努力保护你不受来自我的世界的侵害
Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world,

26:54.710 --> 26:57.680
但我错了 我太傻了
but I was wrong, I was a fool.

26:59.570 --> 27:02.760
我相信是命运让我们走到一起
But I believe that fate brought us together.

27:05.180 --> 27:07.080
简 我不知道你去了哪 发生了什么事
Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened,

27:07.090 --> 27:08.410
但我很清楚一件事
but I do know this.

27:09.210 --> 27:09.920
什么
What?

27:11.560 --> 27:12.430
我知道
I know...

27:13.650 --> 27:14.560
真的知道吗
You do?

27:16.320 --> 27:17.310
知道什么
Do what?

27:17.970 --> 27:18.820
什么
What?

27:22.320 --> 27:23.370
是你干的吗
Is this you?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.880
我们有点事要忙
Uh...we're kind of in the middle of something here.

27:29.880 --> 27:33.070
我确定我们要被捕了
Um...I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.

27:33.070 --> 27:34.040
等一下
Hold that thought.

27:35.420 --> 27:36.850
看看你
Look at you!

27:36.850 --> 27:40.170
还是那么肌肉发达 宇宙怎么样
Still all muscly and everything. How's space?

27:40.760 --> 27:41.700
挺好的
Space is fine.

27:43.410 --> 27:44.510
打扰一下
Excuse me?

27:44.510 --> 27:45.800
- 你是简·福斯特吗 - 是的
- Are you Jane Foster? - Yes.

27:45.800 --> 27:46.980
你认识这个人吗
Do you know this man?

27:48.350 --> 27:49.560
他是我的实习生
He's my intern.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.660
我实习生的实习生
My intern's intern.

27:51.660 --> 27:52.730
这里是私人领地
This is private property

27:52.730 --> 27:54.270
你们全都涉嫌非法入侵
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

27:54.270 --> 27:55.390
请你跟我们走一趟
You'll have to come with me.

28:01.120 --> 28:01.900
简
Jane!

28:02.630 --> 28:03.560
简
Jane?

28:03.560 --> 28:04.510
托尔
Thor.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.170
你没事吧
You alright?

28:06.410 --> 28:08.090
刚刚怎么回事
What just happened?

28:08.090 --> 28:10.570
把手放在头上 退后
Place your hands on your heads, step back!

28:10.570 --> 28:11.890
这位女士不舒服
This woman is unwell.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.060
她很危险
She's dangerous.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.820
我也是
So am I.

28:16.090 --> 28:18.440
请求武警速到现场支援
Requesting armed response officers to the scene.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.430
抱紧我
Hold on to me.

28:19.430 --> 28:20.520
你要干什么
What are you doing?

28:28.530 --> 28:30.520
我去
Holy shit!

28:58.050 --> 28:59.540
我们得再来一次
We have to do that again.

29:04.420 --> 29:05.790
欢迎来到阿斯加德
Welcome to Asgard.

29:11.350 --> 29:16.680
瓦特海姆

29:27.990 --> 29:30.580
瞧瞧我留下了什么 阿格姆

29:32.410 --> 29:34.790
我几乎记不清光明之前的日子了

29:35.540 --> 29:38.710
我们种族的延续将是你留给后世的遗产

29:40.670 --> 29:44.380
我要让阿斯加德人尝尽我们吃的苦头

29:44.430 --> 29:45.720
我要拿回以太粒子

29:45.760 --> 29:47.050
我要恢复我们的世界

29:47.090 --> 29:49.810
我要终结这饱受荼毒的宇宙

29:58.070 --> 29:59.060
这是什么
What's that?

29:59.070 --> 30:00.010
别动
Be still.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.740
这不是地球上的物质 它是什么
This is not of Earth, what is it?

30:10.860 --> 30:11.960
还不清楚
We do not know.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.340
但她体内涌动的能量太大 她撑不住的
But she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her.

30:22.860 --> 30:25.110
这是量子场发生器 对吗
That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?

30:25.120 --> 30:26.660
这是灵魂冶炼炉
It's a Soul Forge.

30:27.150 --> 30:30.490
灵魂冶炼炉能迁移分子能吗
Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another?

30:33.520 --> 30:34.400
是的
Yes.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.300
就是量子场发生器
Quantum field generator.

30:37.470 --> 30:40.340
我的话对你来说只是耳旁风吗
My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?

30:40.340 --> 30:41.600
她病了
She's ill.

30:41.600 --> 30:42.770
她是凡人
She is mortal.

30:43.630 --> 30:45.360
他们都会患病
Illness is their defining trait.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.060
我带她来是因为我们能救她
I brought her here because we can help her.

30:47.060 --> 30:49.300
她不属于阿斯加德
She does not belong here in Asgard

30:49.300 --> 30:52.610
如同山羊肉上不了宴会台面一样
anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table.

30:53.080 --> 30:53.980
他刚刚是说…
Did he just...?

30:54.690 --> 30:56.260
你以为你是谁啊
Who do you think you are?

30:56.260 --> 30:58.740
我是奥丁 阿斯加德国王
I'm Odin. King of Asgard.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.920
九大王国的保护者
Protector of the Nine Realms.

31:02.740 --> 31:03.250
我是…
Oh. Well, I'm...

31:03.260 --> 31:06.070
我很清楚你是谁 简·福斯特
I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.

31:07.270 --> 31:08.820
你跟你爸提过我
You told your dad about me?

31:09.550 --> 31:10.960
她体内有一些物质 父王
Something is within her, father,

31:10.960 --> 31:12.110
我从没见过的物质
something I have not seen before.

31:12.110 --> 31:14.650
她的星球有自己的治疗师 他们叫医生
Her world has its healers. They are called "doctors."

31:14.650 --> 31:15.620
交给他们处理吧
Let them deal with it.

31:15.910 --> 31:17.750
守卫 送她回米德加德
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.480
不 不要
No, I wouldn't...

31:22.620 --> 31:23.620
碰她
...touch her.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.190
简 你没事吧
Jane, are you alright?

31:30.350 --> 31:31.280
这不可能
It's impossible.

31:32.820 --> 31:35.390
她感染的东西在保护她
The infection, it's defending her.

31:36.220 --> 31:37.270
不
No,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.620
是在保护它自己
it's defending itself.

31:40.750 --> 31:42.050
跟我来
Come with me.

31:42.820 --> 31:46.390
有些东西的历史可以追溯到宇宙成形之前
There are relics that predate the universe itself.

31:46.820 --> 31:50.530
她体内的东西 似乎就是这样的古物
What lies within her appears to be one of them.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.760
九大王国并非永恒的
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

31:54.410 --> 31:56.990
他们有诞生的黎明 也将有坍圮的黄昏
They had a dawn as they will have a dusk.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.430
但在那黎明之前 黑暗势力
But before that dawn the dark forces,

32:00.430 --> 32:04.220
黑暗精灵 独霸宇宙
the Dark Elves, reigned absolute

32:04.220 --> 32:05.930
无人匹敌
and unchallenged.

32:07.500 --> 32:08.590
诞自永恒之夜
"Born of eternal night,

32:08.600 --> 32:11.300
黑暗精灵将盗走你的光明
the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light."

32:12.280 --> 32:15.110
小时候母后跟我们讲过他们的故事
They were these stories mother told them to us as children.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.220
他们的首领 马勒基斯
Their leader, Malekith

32:17.400 --> 32:19.120
用那黑暗创造了一个武器
made a weapon out of that darkness,

32:19.120 --> 32:20.730
叫做以太粒子
and it was called the Aether.

32:20.950 --> 32:23.760
其他古物大都是固体
While the other relics often appeared as stones,

32:23.840 --> 32:26.660
以太粒子却是不停变化的流体
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

32:26.710 --> 32:29.110
它能将物体变成暗物质
It changes matter into dark matter,

32:29.280 --> 32:31.350
它寻找寄主寄生
it seeks out to host bodies,

32:31.350 --> 32:33.870
并汲取寄主的生命力
drawing strength from their life force.

32:34.250 --> 32:37.320
马勒基斯想利用以太的能量
Malekith sought to use the Aether's power

32:37.350 --> 32:41.070
让宇宙重归黑暗
to return the universe to one of darkness.

32:41.820 --> 32:44.630
但历经了漫长的血战
But after eternities of blood shed,

32:44.680 --> 32:47.510
我父王包尔 终于取胜
my father Bor, finally triumphed,

32:47.650 --> 32:52.210
从此开启了数千年的和平
ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.150
怎么个取胜法
What happened?

32:55.350 --> 32:56.890
他消灭了黑暗精灵
He killed them all.

32:57.390 --> 32:58.780
您确定吗
Are you certain?

32:59.480 --> 33:01.620
传说以太粒子跟他们一同被摧毁
The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them

33:01.620 --> 33:03.020
但如今却又出现
and yet here it is.

33:04.390 --> 33:06.320
黑暗精灵已经灭绝
The Dark Elves are dead.

33:07.610 --> 33:10.140
书上提到怎么把它从我身体里取出来吗
Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?

33:11.010 --> 33:14.430
没有
No, it does not.

33:24.140 --> 33:27.020
天体汇聚即将形成

33:32.440 --> 33:34.200
你将是最后一个诅咒战士

33:35.360 --> 33:37.000
我愿牺牲自己

33:37.950 --> 33:40.680
就像我们的人民

33:41.330 --> 33:42.510
和你那样

33:50.280 --> 33:52.240
你将成为黑暗

33:53.470 --> 33:57.180
并维持这一形态 直到它耗尽你的生命

34:02.430 --> 34:06.310
在那之前 我们的敌人将不是你的对手

34:09.400 --> 34:16.200
我将摧毁他们的防线 让你回到一个崭新的宇宙中

34:38.390 --> 34:41.320
看管这些无赖真是有失我们的身份
Acting as caretakers to these scoundrels is beneath us.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.740
拜托
Oh, please.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.800
如果他们压在了你的身下 我壮硕的朋友
If they were beneath you my rotund friend,

34:44.800 --> 34:46.000
他们肯定要没命了
they'd all be dead.

35:00.550 --> 35:01.740
不要出队
Keep in line.

35:02.020 --> 35:03.110
往前走
Move it!

35:03.850 --> 35:06.920
奥丁总给我送新朋友来
Odin continues to bring me new friends.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.900
真周到啊
How thoughtful.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.630
我送来的书 你不喜欢吗
The books I sent, do they not interest you?

35:14.060 --> 35:17.500
我就这么打发余生吗 读书
Is that how I'm to wile away eternity, reading?

35:17.500 --> 35:20.740
我已经尽力让你过得舒坦些 洛基
I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.

35:20.740 --> 35:21.860
是嘛
Have you?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.830
奥丁也会操这份心吗
Does Odin share your concern?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.420
托尔呢
Does Thor?

35:27.810 --> 35:31.400
他们如此日夜挂念我 一定很操劳啊
It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.

35:31.410 --> 35:34.940
你很清楚 你落得这个下场完全是咎由自取
You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.

35:34.940 --> 35:36.280
咎由自取
My actions.

35:36.540 --> 35:38.230
你们一直骗我说我生来就该为王
I was merely giving truth to the lie

35:38.230 --> 35:40.120
我不过是将这个谎言
that I've been fed my entire life,

35:40.120 --> 35:41.810
变成了现实
that I was born to be a king.

35:41.820 --> 35:42.850
为王
A king?

35:43.680 --> 35:45.870
真正的国王会承认错误
A true king admits his faults.

35:45.870 --> 35:47.410
你在地球大开杀戒要怎么说
What of the lives you took on Earth?

35:47.410 --> 35:50.680
跟奥丁杀过的人相比简直九牛一毛
A mere handful compared to the number Odin has taken himself.

35:51.060 --> 35:51.890
你父亲
Your father...

35:51.890 --> 35:53.650
他不是我父亲
He's not my father!

35:56.700 --> 35:58.550
那我也不是你母亲吗
Then am I not your mother?

36:03.970 --> 36:05.150
不是
You're not.

36:10.020 --> 36:14.700
你总能看透一切 却看不透自己
You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.

36:29.360 --> 36:32.440
你去找我的时候就知道我有麻烦了吗
When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.

36:33.100 --> 36:36.300
海姆达尔看不到你时 你就不在地球上了
When Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.

36:36.420 --> 36:37.910
这怎么可能啊
Well, how's that possible?

36:37.910 --> 36:39.780
我认为你既在又不在
I believe you were and you weren't.

36:40.150 --> 36:42.490
九大王国在宇宙树中游走
The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil,

36:43.060 --> 36:46.080
像地球环绕太阳那样环绕米德加德
orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun.

36:46.680 --> 36:50.630
每五千年 这些王国列成一条直线
And every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly,

36:50.630 --> 36:52.450
我们称之为天体汇聚
and we call this the Convergence.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.250
在此期间 各王国间的界线会变得模糊
During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred.

36:59.540 --> 37:01.880
你可能就是找到了这样一个模糊点
It's possible you found one of these points.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.120
那个点没有关闭真是走运
We are lucky that it remained open.

37:06.750 --> 37:10.030
一旦各王国偏离汇聚直线
Once the worlds pass out of alignment,

37:12.320 --> 37:14.210
与彼此的连接就会中断
the connection is lost.

37:27.270 --> 37:29.730
我喜欢你解释的方式
I liked the way you explained things.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.260
我会怎么样
What's gonna happen to me?

37:33.450 --> 37:34.960
我会想办法救你的 简
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.010
你父亲说没办法…
Your father said there was...

37:36.010 --> 37:38.420
我父亲也并非无所不知
My father doesn't know everything.

37:38.510 --> 37:40.670
可别让他听见你说这话
Don't let him hear you say that.

37:42.270 --> 37:44.150
简·福斯特 这位是弗丽嘉
Jane Foster, please meet Frigga,

37:44.150 --> 37:46.590
阿斯加德的王后 我母亲
Queen of Asgard, my mother.

38:40.080 --> 38:40.760
快走
Move!

39:27.630 --> 39:28.560
快去地牢
To the dungeons!

39:30.140 --> 39:30.890
快走
Come on!

39:53.990 --> 39:56.600
走左边的楼梯吧
You might want to take the stairs to the left.

40:07.510 --> 40:08.550
是监狱
The prisons.

40:09.020 --> 40:09.840
洛基
Loki.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.220
去吧 我会照顾她
Go, I will look after her.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.300
他们简直像是讨厌被囚禁
It is as if they resented being imprisoned.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.010
有些家伙就是不知足
There's no pleasing some creatures.

40:40.460 --> 40:42.840
回牢房去 事后概不追究
Return to your cells, no further harm will come to you.

40:42.850 --> 40:44.180
我保证
You have my word.

40:45.900 --> 40:48.400
好吧 我收回
Very well, you do not have my word.

40:58.230 --> 41:00.180
派一队人去武器库
Send a squadron to the weapons vault,

41:00.330 --> 41:03.260
不惜一切代价保卫那里 守住地牢
defend it at all costs. Secure the dungeon.

41:03.270 --> 41:04.250
奥丁
Odin.

41:04.400 --> 41:05.370
弗丽嘉
Frigga.

41:05.470 --> 41:06.540
去啊
Go!

41:07.570 --> 41:09.790
就是点小乱子 不用担心
It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.790
你一向不会撒谎
You've never been a very good liar.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.980
带她去你房里 等安全了我会去找你
Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.

41:15.590 --> 41:16.670
你小心
You take care.

41:17.050 --> 41:18.930
历经了多少风风雨雨
Despite all I have survived,

41:19.060 --> 41:21.640
我的王后还是会担心我
my queen still worries over me.

41:22.090 --> 41:25.130
就是因为我担心 你才能逢凶化吉
It's only because I worry over you that you have survived.

41:27.590 --> 41:28.770
听好了
Listen to me now,

41:28.870 --> 41:32.060
你要完全照我说的做 不许多问
I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.360
是 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

46:42.760 --> 46:46.090
阿斯加德的王座被毁了 去保护国王
The throne of Asgard is destroyed! To the king!

47:01.600 --> 47:02.780
弗丽嘉
Frigga.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.440
退下 怪物
Stand down, creature.

47:14.060 --> 47:15.840
我尚可饶你一命
And you may still survive this.

47:15.840 --> 47:18.050
我命大得很呢 女人
I have survive worse, woman.

47:19.310 --> 47:20.550
你是谁
Who are you?

47:21.240 --> 47:22.890
我是马勒基斯
I am Malekith.

47:23.450 --> 47:25.520
我要拿回我的东西
And I would have what is mine.

47:56.700 --> 47:59.200
你拿走了一样东西 孩子
You have taken something, child.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.740
还给我
Give it back.

48:15.480 --> 48:16.780
女巫
Witch.

48:20.230 --> 48:21.440
以太粒子在哪
Where is the Aether.

48:21.990 --> 48:23.840
我绝不会告诉你
I'll never tell you.

48:25.090 --> 48:26.410
这我相信
I believe you.

48:29.320 --> 48:31.150
不
No.

51:57.630 --> 52:00.510
宇宙五千年一个循环
The universe rotates on a five thousand years cycle.

52:00.840 --> 52:03.600
每轮循环中会有一次 各个世界排列成直线
And once a cycle, all the worlds align.

52:03.770 --> 52:06.460
把这个想象成我们的世界
Imagine... imagine that this is our world,

52:07.410 --> 52:08.200
谢谢
oh, thank you,

52:08.200 --> 52:09.610
这是另一个世界
and this is another world,

52:09.610 --> 52:11.330
一般来说 他们彼此分开
normally, they're seperate.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.550
但世界汇聚时
But during the Alignment,

52:13.550 --> 52:15.130
一切都彼此相连
everything is connected,

52:15.810 --> 52:19.640
九大王国都在穿过彼此
all nine realms. All nine realms are passing through each other,

52:19.640 --> 52:22.120
重力 光 甚至物质
and gravity, light, and even matter

52:22.120 --> 52:24.460
都会从一个世界挤进另一个世界
is crushing from one world to the other.

52:26.940 --> 52:30.400
如果这一切现在发生 后果将是毁灭性的
But if this happens to us now, the result could be cataclysmic.

52:31.190 --> 52:33.310
我的重力测量仪能稳定
My gravimetric-spikes can stablize

52:33.560 --> 52:36.010
天体汇聚的界点
the focus point of the Convergance.

52:36.190 --> 52:38.550
这样 其他世界
This time, the Alignment

52:38.560 --> 52:41.510
和他们的纵列就会跟我们擦肩而过
and all the other worlds would just pass us by.

52:41.690 --> 52:43.010
太妙了
It's beautiful.

52:44.710 --> 52:45.950
也很简单
Simple.

52:45.950 --> 52:47.290
有什么问题吗
Any questions?

52:50.640 --> 52:53.730
有 能把我的鞋还给我吗
Yeah, can I have my shoe back?

53:02.070 --> 53:06.080
恢复吧 夺回以太粒子 你需要力气

53:06.570 --> 53:10.160
等你醒来 我们去把他们赶尽杀绝

53:46.250 --> 53:47.850
简·福斯特
Jane Foster?

53:48.720 --> 53:50.180
你得跟我们来
You need to come with us.

53:52.120 --> 53:55.310
我们依然无法恢复王宫的屏障
We are still unable to restore the palace shields.

53:55.310 --> 53:57.040
我们的大炮探测不到他们
Our artillery cannot detect them,

53:57.040 --> 53:59.010
海姆达尔都看不到他们
even Heimdall cannot see them.

54:02.020 --> 54:03.310
陛下
My king,

54:04.040 --> 54:05.820
我们完全失去了防御能力
we're all but defenseless.

54:08.460 --> 54:10.100
你把她囚禁起来了
She's your prisoner now?

54:12.330 --> 54:13.510
都退下
Leave us.

54:22.680 --> 54:24.550
我不想跟你争论
I do not wish to fight with you.

54:25.390 --> 54:27.310
我也不想跟您争论
Nor I with you.

54:27.310 --> 54:29.220
但我想去追击马勒基斯
But I intended to pursue Malekith.

54:29.260 --> 54:31.000
以太粒子在我们手上
We possess the Aether.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.720
马勒基斯会送上门来
Malekith will come to us.

54:32.720 --> 54:34.670
没错 他会摧毁我们
Yes, and he will destroy us.

54:34.670 --> 54:37.090
你高估了这些怪物
You overestimate the power of these creatures.

54:37.090 --> 54:39.410
不 我只是珍惜我们人民的生命
No, I value our people's lives.

54:39.410 --> 54:41.020
我带简去黑暗世界
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,

54:41.020 --> 54:43.350
将敌人从阿斯加德引开
and draw the enemies away from Asgard.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.590
马勒基斯把以太粒子从简身体里取出时
When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane,

54:45.590 --> 54:47.920
它会暴露在外 不堪一击
it would be exposed and vulnerable.

54:47.920 --> 54:50.080
我到时就把他们一同消灭
And I would destroy it and him.

54:51.610 --> 54:52.970
你这是冒险
If you fail,

54:53.690 --> 54:56.620
一旦失败 武器就会落入敌手
you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemie.

54:56.620 --> 54:59.300
如果我们坐以待毙只会更危险
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

54:59.320 --> 55:01.250
他的舰队可能此刻就在我们头上盘旋
His ships could be over our heads right now,

55:01.250 --> 55:02.480
我们根本无从知道
we would never even know.

55:02.700 --> 55:04.020
等他来了
If and when he comes,

55:04.170 --> 55:07.760
他的手下会败在数万阿斯加德士兵的兵刃下
his men will fall on ten thousand Asgardian blades.

55:07.760 --> 55:09.570
那我们又要牺牲多少人呢
And how many our men should fall on theirs?

55:09.570 --> 55:11.620
牺牲多少都在所不惜
As many as I need it.

55:20.620 --> 55:21.890
我们会坚持战斗
We will fight

55:24.780 --> 55:26.680
坚持到最后一个阿斯加德人
till the last Asgardian breath,

55:28.060 --> 55:30.190
坚持到阿斯加德人鲜血流尽
till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

55:33.340 --> 55:36.450
那您跟马勒基斯又有何区别
Then how are you different from Malekith?

55:39.520 --> 55:41.820
我的儿子 区别在于 我终将胜利
The different, my son, is that I will win.

55:56.290 --> 55:57.770
简不回我电话
Jane isn't calling me back.

55:57.900 --> 55:59.390
艾瑞克不回我电话
Erik isn't calling me Back.

55:59.420 --> 56:01.170
神盾局也不回我电话
Stupid S.H.I.E.L.D isn't calling me back.

56:01.170 --> 56:02.210
神盾局是什么
What's S.H.I.E.L.D?

56:02.210 --> 56:03.030
是秘密
It's a secret.

56:03.210 --> 56:05.430
艾瑞克 又是达西
Hi, Erik, it's Darcy again.

56:05.690 --> 56:06.800
托尔回来了
Thor came back,

56:06.840 --> 56:08.230
他把简带去了阿斯加德
he took Jane to Asgard.

56:08.230 --> 56:12.160
我也不知道该怎么办才好
And I'm not sure what I'm suppose to do.

56:12.210 --> 56:13.960
这周还有人丢了点什么
Something else went missing this week,

56:13.960 --> 56:17.000
天体物理学家 艾瑞克·塞尔维格博士
when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig

56:17.050 --> 56:19.690
因卷入纽约外星人入侵事件
notable for his involvement in the alien invasion

56:19.690 --> 56:20.680
而为人所知
of New York.

56:20.870 --> 56:24.480
- 裸奔在… - 达西 你得看看这个
- Stripped nude... - Darcy, you really need to look at this.

56:25.020 --> 56:26.340
你的朋友艾瑞克
Your friend Erik,

56:26.480 --> 56:27.930
他姓什么来着
what was his last name again?

56:29.150 --> 56:32.570
并对该历史景点的游客大吼大叫
...and began shouting at visitors to the historic site.

56:32.580 --> 56:35.150
随后他被警方拘留
He was later taken into police custody

56:35.240 --> 56:37.260
以待精神鉴定
for psychiatric evaluation.

56:37.660 --> 56:39.960
警方仍然不肯证实…
The police is still refusing to confirm...

56:50.240 --> 56:52.070
你没去参加奥丁的军事会议
You were not at Odin's war council.

56:52.590 --> 56:55.270
你父王下令关闭彩虹桥
The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders.

56:55.270 --> 56:57.300
任何人不得进出阿斯加德
No one was to come, or to go.

56:59.610 --> 57:02.310
连我都看不见敌人
We face an enemy that is invisible even to me,

57:02.310 --> 57:03.630
那么
what use

57:04.370 --> 57:06.070
我这个守护者还有何用
is a guardian such as that.

57:07.210 --> 57:09.860
马勒基斯还会回来的 这你很清楚
Malekith will return. You know this.

57:12.960 --> 57:14.210
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

57:14.810 --> 57:16.880
我不能违抗国王的命令
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.

57:17.510 --> 57:18.620
即便是为你
Not even for you.

57:18.620 --> 57:19.980
我没有这个意思
I'm not asking you to.

57:20.230 --> 57:22.920
九大王国需要一个坚强 服众的众神之父
The realms need their All-father strong and unchallenged,

57:22.920 --> 57:24.470
不论情况是否如此
whether he is or not.

57:25.420 --> 57:27.110
但他看不清现实 海姆达尔
But he's binded Heimdall,

57:27.750 --> 57:29.250
仇恨和悲伤蒙蔽了他
by hatred and by grief.

57:29.250 --> 57:30.180
我们不都是吗
As are we all.

57:30.180 --> 57:31.960
我看得很清楚
I see clearly enough.

57:32.430 --> 57:34.070
风险太大了
The risks are to great.

57:34.070 --> 57:36.550
从现在起 我们走的每一步都有风险
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

57:36.680 --> 57:38.260
我们别无选择
There is no other way.

57:42.690 --> 57:44.230
你要我怎么做
What do you require of me.

57:44.950 --> 57:48.160
我要你们做的事 是最严重的叛国罪
What I'm about to ask you is treason of the highest order.

57:48.760 --> 57:50.590
即便成功 我们也将被流放
Success will bring us exile,

57:50.590 --> 57:52.540
而失败则必死无疑
and failure shall mean our death.

57:55.590 --> 57:58.150
马勒基斯知道以太粒子在这儿
Malekith knew the Aether was here.

57:58.240 --> 57:59.760
他能感应它的能量
He can sense its power.

58:00.130 --> 58:02.590
如果不采取行动 他会再次攻来
If we do nothing, he'll come for it again,

58:02.590 --> 58:05.880
但这次 他们将彻底摧毁阿斯加德
but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.700
我们得带简离开这儿
We must move Jane off world.

58:10.040 --> 58:11.310
彩虹桥已经关闭
The Bifrost has been shut down,

58:11.310 --> 58:13.420
宇宙魔方也锁在地下室里
and the Tesseract locked away in the vault.

58:13.890 --> 58:15.830
离开阿斯加德还有其他途径
There are other path off Asgard,

58:16.190 --> 58:17.830
了解这些途径的人为数不多
ways known only to a few.

58:17.960 --> 58:19.540
准确说只有一个
One actually.

58:22.080 --> 58:22.720
不会吧
No.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.320
托尔
Thor.

58:29.930 --> 58:31.430
都这么久了
After all this time,

58:31.430 --> 58:33.120
你现在来看我
now you come to visit me,

58:35.190 --> 58:36.190
来干什么
why?

58:37.970 --> 58:39.470
幸灾乐祸吗
Have you come to gloat?

58:40.390 --> 58:41.010
嘲笑我
To mock?

58:41.010 --> 58:42.240
洛基 够了
Loki enough.

58:43.070 --> 58:44.560
别再用幻象了
No more illusions.

58:52.010 --> 58:53.510
现在你看到我了 哥哥
Now you see me brother.

59:02.780 --> 59:03.980
她走得痛苦吗
Did she suffer?

59:04.240 --> 59:06.610
我不是来跟你一同哀悼母亲的
I did not come here to share our grief.

59:07.210 --> 59:10.290
我是来给你机会得到一样更好的东西
Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.

59:11.560 --> 59:12.550
说
Go on.

59:13.020 --> 59:15.370
我知道你跟我一样想复仇
I know you seek vengeance as much as I do.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.650
你帮我逃出阿斯加德 我就给你机会
You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.070
让你复仇
Vengeance.

59:20.700 --> 59:22.090
然后再回这儿来
And afterwards this cell.

59:29.800 --> 59:33.990
你一定是走投无路了 才会来找我帮忙
You must be truely desperate to come to me for help.

59:36.370 --> 59:37.840
你凭什么觉得你能信任我
What makes you think you can trust me.

59:37.840 --> 59:38.910
我不信任
I don't.

59:41.060 --> 59:42.020
母亲信任你
Mother did.

59:43.330 --> 59:45.950
但你要知道 过去我们交手的时候
But you should know that when we fought each other in the past,

59:46.900 --> 59:48.210
我仍然抱有一丝希望
I did so with a glimpse of hope

59:48.220 --> 59:50.350
相信我弟弟还没完全消失
that my brother was still in there somewhere.

59:51.720 --> 59:54.070
这一丝希望已经幻灭 不能再保护你了
That hope is no longer exist to protect you.

59:55.100 --> 59:57.090
你敢背叛我 我就杀了你
You betray me, and I will kill you.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.240
什么时候出发
When do we start?

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.230
他肯定会背叛你的
He will betray you.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.460
让他试试看
He will try.

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.180
这太不像你了 哥哥
This is so unlike you, brother.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.540
这样秘密行动
So clandestine.

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.920
你真的不想靠蛮力打出一条血路出去吗
Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.030
你再不闭嘴我就要动手了
If you keep speaking I just might.

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:24.790
好吧 听你的
Fine, as you wish,

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:26.600
我都不在这儿
I'm not even here.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:28.770
这样好点了吧
Is this better?

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:30.990
比你本人强多了
It's better company at least.

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:35.370
不过 我们还可以再低调点
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.400
哥哥
Umm, brother,

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.010
你可真美
you look ravishing.

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:44.370
就算变成这样 我照样能让你死得很惨
It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.590
好吧
Very well.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.000
或许你想要你新结交的小伙伴
Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.280
毕竟你似乎很喜欢他们
given that you seem to like them so much.

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.130
这样好多了呢
Oh this is much better.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.490
服装不太合身
The costume is bit much.

01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:56.730
太紧了
So tight.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.110
但那股自信
But the confidence,

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:00.580
我能感到正义在我身体里涌动
I can feel the righteousness surging.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.370
想跟我畅谈一下真理吗
Hey, do you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth?

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:04.230
或是荣誉
Honor?

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:05.310
爱国主义
Patriotism?

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:06.590
天佑美国…
God bless America...

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.590
干什么
What?

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.610
你至少也该给我件武器啊
You could at least furnish me with a weapon.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:18.650
我的匕首什么的
My dagger, something.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.590
这才对嘛
At last,

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.710
总算讲点理了
a little common sense.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.380
你不就喜欢小戏法吗
And I thought you like tricks.

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:37.430
然后呢
Well, what then?

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:40.870
你心爱的凡人被一整队英灵战士看守着
Your lovely mortal is been guarded by a legion of Einherjar

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:42.720
他们大老远就能看到你
who will see you coming from miles away.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.780
去接她的不是我
I won't be the one who comes for her.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.600
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:57.320
那正好 我们走
Good, let's go.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:04.720
是你…
You're...

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:06.520
我是洛基 你可能听说过我
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.

01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:08.560
这一掌是为了纽约
That was for New York.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:10.650
我喜欢她
I like her.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.770
那众神之父呢
And what of the All-Father?

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.030
我曾立誓向他通报一切叛国罪行
It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne.

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:18.890
你要我过来
You called me here

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.650
说是有紧急情况
on urgent matter.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:22.800
是什么事
What is it?

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.700
有人叛国犯上 陛下
Treason, my lord.

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:25.670
是谁
Whose?

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.760
我
Mine.

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:29.910
陛下
My king,

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.900
那个凡人被劫走了
the mortal has been taken.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.310
阻止托尔
Stop Thor,

01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:39.190
不惜一切代价
by any means necessary.

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:43.600
他们在那儿 抓住他们
There they are! Take them.

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:45.570
听我命令
On my command.

01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:47.320
我拖住他们 带她走
I'll hold them off. Take her.

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:49.370
谢谢你
Thank you.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.640
你敢背叛他
Betray him,

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:54.750
我就杀了你
and I'll kill you.

01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:58.550
我也很高兴见到你 希芙
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:09.160
就算洛基肯帮你 你也救出了那个凡人
Assuming you can get Loki's help and you can free this mortal,

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.130
又有什么用啊
what good would it do?

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:14.270
我们踏出宫殿一步 就必死无疑
We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:17.640
所以 我的朋友 我们不会步行离开
That, my friend, is why we won't be leaving by foot.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.600
我尽量帮你拖延时间
I will give you as much time as I can.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.870
谢谢你 我的朋友
Thank you, my friend.

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:32.320
你胆敢打背叛他的主意
If you even think of betraying him.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.550
你就杀了我吗
You'll kill me?

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:36.140
看来你得排队了
Evidently there will be a line.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.670
你不是说你会驾驶这东西吗
I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.860
我是说这能有多难
I said "How hard could it be".

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:00.560
他们在飞船上
They're on the ship.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.330
拦住飞船
Get to the ship.

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:08.540
不管你在做什么 哥哥 你得快点了
Well, whatever you're doing brother, I suggest you do it faster.

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:09.650
闭嘴 洛基
Shut up, Loki.

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:13.700
你肯定漏掉什么了
You must have missed something.

01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:16.170
我没有 我把这上面的按钮都按遍了
No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.

01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:17.890
别用力那么猛 轻轻按
No. Don't hit it, just press it gently.

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:20.810
我在轻轻按了 不好使
I am pressing it gently, it's not working.

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:29.290
擒住他 拿下他
Get him! Get him!

01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:59.730
还有根柱子没撞到呢
I think you missed a column.

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.530
闭嘴
Shut up!

01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:08.810
你为什么不让我来呢
Look, why don't you let me take over,

01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:10.300
我的驾驶技术显然更好
I'm clearly the best pilot.

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.320
是嘛
Is that right?

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.210
我们两个人中 谁才是会飞的那个
Well, out of the two of us, which one can actually fly?

01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:26.380
天啊 她死了吗
Oh dear, is she dead?

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:27.170
简
Jane.

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:29.090
我没事
I'm okay.

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:37.370
别多嘴
Not a word.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.790
他们跟上来了
Now they're following us.

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:47.130
他们开火了
Now they're firing at us.

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.840
多谢你的解说 洛基
Yeah, thank you for the commentary Loki,

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.420
完全不会让人分心
it's not at all distracting.

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:57.480
干得漂亮 你把你爷爷的头砍下来了
Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.080
这真是太棒了
You know this is wonderful,

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.500
这主意真是了不起
this is a tremendous idea.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:16.110
我们去把宇宙中最大最显眼的飞船偷来
Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe,

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:17.370
乘着它逃跑
and escape in that.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.410
驾着它满城乱飞
Flying around the city,

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:20.980
看见什么撞什么 让大家都看见我们
smashing into everything in sight, so everyone can see us.

01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:22.180
太聪明了 托尔
It's brilliant, Thor.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:23.380
真有你的
It's truly brilliant.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.860
在牢里关了那么久
I see your time in the dungeons

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.490
你还是这么优雅啊 洛基
has make you no less graceful, Loki.

01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:47.030
你骗我
You lied to me.

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:50.250
挺厉害啊
I'm impressed.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.550
你满意我很高兴
I'm glad you're pleased.

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.930
遵守你的承诺吧
Now do as you promised.

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:54.930
带我们去你的秘密通道
And take us to your secret pathway.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:18.940
范达尔
Fandral.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:19.870
好的
Right.

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.530
为了阿斯加德
For Asgard.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.240
别往心里去啊 伙计们
Nothing personal, boys.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:47.740
洛基
Loki.

01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:49.290
如果那么容易
If it were easy,

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.320
谁都能做到了
everyone would do it.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.600
你疯了吗
Are you mad?

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.580
或许吧
Possibly.

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.280
胜利到达
Ta-da.

01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:19.450
我们得马上出击

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.490
不

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:28.750
不必去阿斯加德了

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.880
以太自己送上门了

01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:53.970
那能量要是给我 我能做多少事啊
What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.810
你会被吞噬的
It would consume you.

01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:59.500
她不就没事
She's holding up all right

01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:01.410
暂时没事
For now.

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.200
她拥有的力量你无法理解
She's strong in ways you'd never even know.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.890
道别吧
Say goodbye.

01:09:06.690 --> 01:09:07.650
不会是今天
Not this day.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.160
今天 明天
This day, the next,

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.810
一百年 算什么
a hundred years, is nothing,

01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:13.290
弹指一挥间而已
it's a heartbeat.

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:15.440
你永远放不开手
You'll never be ready.

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.400
你唯一珍视的挚爱终将被岁月夺去
The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.280
那样你就满足了吗
And will that satisfy you.

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.600
我永远不会满足
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.040
我永远不会放弃
Surrender is not in mine.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.010
果然是奥丁之子
Son of Odin.

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:29.100
我不只是奥丁的儿子
No, not just of Odin.

01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:31.860
你以为母亲只爱你吗
You think you alone were loved of Mother?

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.450
她把技艺教给了你 但她信任的是我
You had her tricks but I had her trust.

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:35.310
信任
Trust?

01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:38.080
那是她的遗言吗
Was that her last expression?

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:39.550
她信任你
Trust?

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:41.060
你却眼睁睁看她遇害
When you let her die?

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.900
你在地牢里出手相救了吗
What help were you in your cell?

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:43.860
谁把我关进去的
Who put me there?

01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:45.470
谁把我关进去的
Who put me there?

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:48.640
你心里清楚 你心里清楚是谁
You know damn well. You know damn well who.

01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:57.000
她不会希望我们兄弟相争
She wouldn't want us to fight.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.290
她都见怪不怪了吧
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:07.970
真希望我能相信你
I wish I can trust you.

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:24.520
相信我的怒火吧
Trust my rage.

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:34.660
塞尔维格先生 请签收您父亲的物品
You'll have to sign for your fathers' belongings Mr. Selvig.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:35.960

你怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.930
你在电视上裸奔了
You were naked on TV.

01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:22.130
好了 该走了 还有事要做
Okay, it's time to go, lots to do.

01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:25.750
越来越尴尬了
Getting weird now.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.780
怎么能让我管这些事
I should not be left in charge of stuff like this,

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.950
又没人给我那么多钱
I don't get paid enough.

01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:33.380
是根本没人给我钱
I don't get paid period.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.170
那个 我叫伊恩 达西的实习生

我脑子里有个神
I've had a god in my brain.

01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:46.580
这滋味可不好受了
I don't recommend it.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.690
塞尔维格博士 这设备响了
Dr. Selvig, sir, your gear is beeping.

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:51.580
果然开始了
It's happening.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.200
比我计算得还早
It's sooner than I calculate.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.570
什么开始了
Wait what's happening?

01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:59.050
鸟吗
Birds?

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:01.060
鸟儿开始了
Birds are happening?

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.760
那是一群欧椋鸟
It's starling. It's called the murmuration.

01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:06.070
小时候我爸常带我去观鸟

刚刚怎么回事
What the hell was that?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.310
你笑什么
Why are you smiling?

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.780
发现这世界比我还疯狂
There's nothing more reassuring than realize

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.860
我倍感安心
that the world is crazier than you are.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.670
带我去简的实验室
Take me to Jane's lab.

01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:52.980
简

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:01.420
马勒基斯
Malekith.

01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:25.180
准备好了吗
All right, are you ready?

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.960
我准备好了

你这破计划得把咱俩都害死
You know this plan of yours is gonna get us killed.

或许吧
Yeah, possibly.

你还不相信我吗 哥哥
You still don't trust me, brother?

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.290
你会相信你吗
Would you?

01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:03.490
不会
No, I wouldn't.

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:08.470

你真以为我在乎弗丽嘉
You really think I cared about Frigga.

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:25.110
在乎你们任何人吗
About any of you.

01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:29.880
我只渴望
All I ever wanted

01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:31.760
看到你和奥丁

01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:02.810

看着我
Look at me.

01:16:19.190 --> 01:16:20.950

我们地狱见 怪物
See you in hell, monster.

- 你真傻 怎么不听我的 - 我知道
- You fool, you didn't listen. - I know.

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:16.420

没事的
It's all right.

你的英勇我会禀告父王
I'll tell father what you did here today.

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:39.220
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.800
不
No!

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.680

不只是在阿斯加德或是哪个星球
No just on Asgard or on a stars.

The Convergence.

01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:05.180
我要是没发现以太 就不会走到这一步了
None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.

01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:08.910
马勒基斯只会更早得到以太
Then Malekith would've only possess that much sooner.

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:11.700
我是找你的时候发现了以太

01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:13.640

01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:29.590
理查德是谁
So who's Richard?

01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:30.700
你不是吧
Really?

01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:40.440

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:44.340
你怎么说走就走 全世界都疯了

at the spot where all the nine worlds are connecting.

01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:19.010
以增加以太的威力
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:23.170
威力随连通的王国数的增加呈指数增长
For each additional world, the power will increase exponentially.

01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:25.690
足以波及整个宇宙
The effect would be universal.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.810
但汇聚只会维持很短的时间
Yes, but the Alignment is only temperory,

01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:30.710
他必须分秒不差地赶到正确地点
he must be in exactly the right place at the right time.

01:25:30.710 --> 01:25:32.400
那正确地点是哪
Well, how do we know where that is?

01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:35.470
沿着路标走
We follow the directions.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:39.030
几千年前汇聚也曾发生过
This has happened before, thousands of years ago.

01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:40.920
古人曾亲眼目睹
And the Ancients were there to see it.

01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:43.730
那些了不起的古建筑工程
All the great constructions,

01:25:44.050 --> 01:25:47.120
玛雅人 中国人 古埃及人
the Mayans, the Chinese, the Egyptians.

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.630
都曾利用汇聚对重力的影响
They made use of the gravitational affects of the Convergence.

01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:52.030
这就是我们的地图
And they left us a map.

01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:53.820
巨石阵
Stonehenge.

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:57.710
斯诺登山 大奥姆岬
Snowdon. Great Orme.

01:25:57.710 --> 01:26:00.010
以他们为坐标 就能找到
These are all coordinates. Taking us...

01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:02.580
这里
here.

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.930
格林威治
Greenwich.

01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:08.950
九大王国之间的界限将几乎消失
The walls between worlds will almost non-existing,

01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:10.450
物理学定律完全乱套
physics is gonna go ballistic.

01:26:10.450 --> 01:26:12.290
重力忽增忽减
Increases and decreases of gravity,

01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:13.740
空间挤压
spacial extrusions,

01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:16.560
现实的世界在那里支离破碎
the very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart.

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:21.050
我还是穿上裤子吧
I better get my pants.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.120
集中精神 这可重要了
Focus, this is important.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.750
我们得先把仪器钉在周围
We had to hammer them in all around the site,

01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:29.060
然后简和艾瑞克会在塔上启动
and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.490
都绑在一起了
They're taped together.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.140
你知道这仪器是干什么的吗
Do you even know what these things do?

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:35.210
不知道
No.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.000
我也不知道
Neither do I.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.440
- 快点 快点 - 好吧
- Come on, come on, come on. - Right.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.450
我…
Holy

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.740
去
shit.

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:23.180
何必跑这么远 阿斯加德人
You needn't have come so far Asgardian.

01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:25.730
死亡很快就要找上门了
Death would've come to you soon enough.

01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:27.150
那也不是死在你手上
Not by your hand.

01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:30.300
你们的宇宙就不该存在
Your universe was never meant to be.

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:35.050
你的王国 你的家人将被彻底消灭
Your world, and your family will be extinguished.

01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:39.000
没时间了
We're running out of time.

01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:40.100
快了
Almost there.

01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:41.750
这真的能行吗
You sure this is gonna work.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:44.770
这仪器是用来检测异常的 而不是引发异常
These devices were made to detect anomalies, not causing them.

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:46.360
快点
Come on.

01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:52.700
快点 达西
Come on, Darcy.

01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:05.090
你有那么强的力量
You know, with all that power,

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:07.580
出手怎么这么轻
I thought you'd hit harder.

01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:33.650
好了
Done.

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:43.450
天体汇聚将于7分钟后达到最佳状态
The Convergences will be in full effect in 7 minutes.

01:29:43.450 --> 01:29:46.020
那我们得拖住马勒基斯8分钟
That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for 8.

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.830
好了 你最好扶稳了
Okay, you might want to hold on to something.

01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:02.980
太厉害了 你怎么办到的
That is awesome. How did you do that?

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:06.750
重力场与各王国之间的薄弱点相互作用
Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds...

01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:08.790
- 产生了 - 干掉拿剑的那个
- creating... - Get the guy with the sword.

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.660
走吧
Let's go.

01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:17.220
这是怎么回事
What the hell just happened?

01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:19.440
快跑
Move!

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.240
你们干什么呢
What are you all doing?

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.220
赶快出去啊
You need to get out of here. Now.

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:41.380
你开玩笑呢
You're joking, right?

01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:42.570
那可是雷神
That's Thor out there,

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:44.980
还拿着锤子挥来挥去
he's waving his hammer around and everything.

01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.840
请确认是否为敌方飞船
Confirming ship is hostile.

01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:06.770
确认为敌方飞船
Confirmed, ship is hostile.

01:32:06.930 --> 01:32:08.550
可以开火
You have permission to engage.

01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:10.770
收到 导弹锁定
Roger, missiles locked.

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.560
导弹已发射
Missiles away.

01:32:14.690 --> 01:32:17.740
导弹偏离目标 重复 偏离目标
Missiles off target. I repeat, target missed.

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.720
我失去控制了 求救 求救
I'm losing control. Mayday. Mayday.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.480
我失去控制了
Lost positive control.

01:32:23.610 --> 01:32:24.680
你干什么
What're you doing?

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.290
信号连不上了
The signal's not connecting.

01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:29.920
简
Jane.

01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:31.100
快跑
Come on.

01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:14.040
你还好吧
Are you all right?

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.100
你救了我
You save my life.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.550
是啊 没错
Yeah. I guess I did.

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:32.760
- 达西 - 简
- Darcy? - Jane.

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.300
伊恩
Ian.

01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:35.710
塞尔维格
Selvig.

01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:37.070
飞锤
Mew mew!

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.580
注意站台间隙
Mind the gap.

01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:46.290
怎么去格林威治
How do I get to Greenwich?

01:33:47.010 --> 01:33:48.830
上车 坐三站
Take this train, three stops.

01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:52.760
注意站台间隙
Mind the gap.

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:57.550
抱歉 抱歉
Sorry. Sorry.

01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.110
没时间了
We're out of time.

01:34:36.330 --> 01:34:37.300
简
Jane.

01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:38.780
简
Jane.

01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:05.890
托尔
Thor.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:08.410
太晚了
We're too late.

01:35:09.710 --> 01:35:11.420
天体汇聚已达最佳状态
The Convergence is at its peak.

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.200
这东西能阻止他吗
Can those things stop him?

01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:15.190
在这儿不行
Not from here.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.750
我们没法接近他
We can't get close enough.

01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.070
我能
I can.

01:35:45.630 --> 01:35:46.740
马勒基斯
Malekith.

01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:56.680
黑暗回来了 阿斯加德人
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

01:35:57.370 --> 01:36:00.350
你是来看宇宙湮灭的吗
Have you come to witness the end of the universe?

01:36:00.690 --> 01:36:02.880
我是来受降的
I've come to accept your surrender.

01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:24.840
你觉得你能阻止吗
You think you can stop this?

01:36:25.170 --> 01:36:27.740
以太是不可摧毁的
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.170
但你不是
But you can.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.600
托尔
Thor!

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:17.690
不要
No.

01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:29.030
简
Jane.

01:37:59.370 --> 01:38:00.690
大家还好吧
Everybody okay?

01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:46.840
他会回来的
He's gonna come back.

01:38:49.730 --> 01:38:51.100
就是…
Except, you know...

01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:54.250
上次他一走就是两年
last time he was gone for like two years.

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.670
他才走了两天
Well, it's only been two days, so...

01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.660
他走之前说什么了吗
Did he say anything before he left?

01:38:59.790 --> 01:39:02.240
说了 他得跟他父王做些解释
Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father,

01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:04.160
我们逃出来的时候
he kinda committed treason

01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.030
他犯了叛国罪
on our way out.

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.400
你曾说 不会有比我更贤明的君主
You once said, there would never be a wiser king than me.

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:20.860
你错了
You were wrong.

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:24.770
九大王国汇聚在一起
The Alignment has broght all the realms together,

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:28.490
他们都看到你用生命拯救了他们
every one of them saw you offer your life to save them.

01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:33.180
阿斯加德要如何回报它新的国王呢
What can Asgard offer its new king in return?

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.800
我的生活
My life.

01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:40.030
父王 我不能做国王
Father I cannot be king of Asgard.

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:45.240
我会用一生竭力保卫九大王国
I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath,

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:47.250
但坐在王位上可办不到
but I cannot do so from that chair.

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.520
洛基虽有不是
Loki, for all his grave imbalance

01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:52.150
却懂得一些我永远学不会的道理
understood rule as I know I never will.

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:55.010
王位所带来的残忍和牺牲
The brutality, the sacrifice.

01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:56.890
会改变一个人
It changes you.

01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:00.260
我宁可做好人 也不愿做明主
I'd rather be a good man, than a great king.

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:05.790
这是我儿子的意愿 还是他爱的女人的意思
Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves.

01:40:06.010 --> 01:40:08.350
我从没觉得是母亲在左右您的决定
When you speak, do I never hear mother's voice.

01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:13.020
我不是为了简 父王
This is not for Jane, father.

01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:15.480
她不知道我要说什么
She does not know what I came here to say.

01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.480
禁止我见她
Now, forbid me to see her,

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.430
或是同意她与我共同治国 都无济于事
or say she can rule by my side, it changes nothing.

01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:23.990
一个儿子太过渴求王位
One son who wanted the throne too much,

01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:27.410
另一个却弃之而去
another who will not take it.

01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:30.000
这就是我留给后世的吗
Is this my legacy?

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.710
洛基光荣牺牲
Loki died with honor.

01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:35.420
我也要尽力而为 这还不够吗
I shall try to live the same, is that not legacy enough?

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.020
只要你配得上它
It belongs to you

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:51.300
它就是你的
if you're worthy of it.

01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:52.790
我会尽力的
I shall try to.

01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:57.300
我不能祝福你
I cannot give you my blessing,

01:40:58.150 --> 01:41:00.150
也不能祝你好运
nor can I wish you good fortune.

01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:01.960
我知道
I know.

01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:08.710
即使我为我儿子如今的为人而骄傲
If I were proud of the man my son had become,

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.380
我也不能说出来
even that, I could not say.

01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:17.200
但我会在心里赞许你
It would speak only from my heart.

01:41:19.130 --> 01:41:20.180
去吧
Go.

01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:22.740
我的儿子
My son.

01:41:25.230 --> 01:41:26.440
谢谢 父王
Thank you, father.

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.140
不
No.

01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:45.610
该谢谢你
Thank you.

01:44:04.530 --> 01:44:06.500
向二位介绍
I present to you

01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:10.640
收集者坦利亚·蒂万
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

01:44:16.710 --> 01:44:20.360
阿斯加德人 真是荣幸
Asgardians. It's an honor.

01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:26.470
你知道我们为何而来
You know why we're here.

01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:32.190
是的
Of course.

01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:35.310
但容我问一句
But if I may ask.

01:44:35.710 --> 01:44:39.760
为什么不保管在你们那儿呢
Why not keep it secure in your own vault?

01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:42.220
宇宙魔方已经在阿斯加德了
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

01:44:43.050 --> 01:44:46.480
不该把两颗无限宝石放得太近
It's not wise to keep two Infinity Stone so close together.

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:49.110
很明智
That's very wise.

01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:01.140
我保证
I can assure you

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.630
在我手里
it will be absolutely safe here

01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:11.110
一定万无一失
in my collection.

01:45:13.170 --> 01:45:14.670
务必保管好
See that it is.

01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:35.750
一个拿到
One down,

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.610
还剩五个
five to go.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:46:00.960
六颗无限宝石分别代表
空间 时间 灵魂 现实 力量 意志
原由包括收集者在内的宇宙元老们保管
集齐宝石者可拥有支配宇宙的无限神力
而灭霸将六颗宝石制作成了"无限手套"
可以说是终极神器
