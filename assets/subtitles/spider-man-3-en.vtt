All right, tell me again.
I'm sorry, I'm an idiot.

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:40.228
There was a billionaire,

02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:42.830
he had a tin suit
and he could fly, right?

02:17:45.166 --> 02:17:48.102
Okay, and there was
a really angry green man.

02:17:48.236 --> 02:17:50.171
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

02:17:50.303 --> 02:17:52.315
VENOM: <i>And you thought Lethal
Protector was a shit name.</i>

02:17:52.339 --> 02:17:54.341
Yeah, because it is.

02:17:54.474 --> 02:17:55.710
Now tell me again

02:17:55.843 --> 02:17:58.746
about your purple alien
that loves stones.

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:01.516
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,
aliens do not love stones.

02:18:01.649 --> 02:18:03.584
- VENOM: <i>Eddie, don't start.</i>
- They don't.

02:18:03.718 --> 02:18:05.686
Know what aliens love?
Eating brains.

02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:07.922
Because that's what they do.
All right?

02:18:08.055 --> 02:18:10.725
Señor, he made
my family disappear.

02:18:12.093 --> 02:18:13.194
For five years.

02:18:14.529 --> 02:18:15.596
Five years?

02:18:17.865 --> 02:18:19.033
That's a long time.

02:18:21.434 --> 02:18:22.937
Maybe I...

02:18:23.070 --> 02:18:25.873
Maybe I should go to New York
and speak to this...

02:18:27.374 --> 02:18:28.374
Spider-Man.

02:18:28.475 --> 02:18:31.546
VENOM: <i>Eddie, we are drunk.</i>

02:18:32.914 --> 02:18:34.182
<i>Let's go skinny-dip!</i>

02:18:34.314 --> 02:18:35.750
I don't think
we should skinny-dip.

02:18:35.883 --> 02:18:37.685
You have to pay the bill.

02:18:37.819 --> 02:18:39.187
VENOM: <i>What is happening? No!</i>

02:18:39.319 --> 02:18:41.622
<i>No, we just got here!
No, not again!</i>

02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:48.029
And there he goes.

02:18:48.162 --> 02:18:51.098
Without paying the bill,
no tips, nothing.

02:26:01.563 --> 02:26:03.531
WONG: <i>Don't cast that spell.</i>

02:26:03.665 --> 02:26:05.667
<i>- It's too dangerous.</i>
- WONG: <i>Why?</i>

02:26:05.799 --> 02:26:09.069
STRANGE: <i>We tampered with
the stability of space-time.</i>

02:26:09.203 --> 02:26:11.071
<i>The multiverse is a concept</i>

02:26:11.205 --> 02:26:14.208
<i>about which we know
frighteningly little.</i>

02:26:16.143 --> 02:26:18.078
MORDO:
<i>Your desecration of reality...</i>

02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:20.749
<i>will not go unpunished.</i>

02:26:26.655 --> 02:26:28.255
STRANGE: <i>It was the only way.</i>

02:26:33.193 --> 02:26:37.632
<i>But I never meant
for any of this to happen.</i>

02:26:56.551 --> 02:26:57.585
STRANGE: Wanda.

02:26:59.688 --> 02:27:02.222
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up.

02:27:02.356 --> 02:27:06.060
I made mistakes,
and people were hurt.

02:27:06.193 --> 02:27:08.563
I'm not here to talk
about Westview.

02:27:09.531 --> 02:27:10.765
Then what are you here for?

02:27:10.898 --> 02:27:11.932
We need your help.

02:27:13.367 --> 02:27:14.602
With what?

02:27:14.736 --> 02:27:16.370
What do you know
about the multiverse?

02:27:25.212 --> 02:27:26.413
I'm sorry, Stephen.

02:27:28.882 --> 02:27:31.151
<i>I hope you understand...</i>

02:27:33.788 --> 02:27:35.557
<i>the greatest threat...</i>

02:27:36.758 --> 02:27:38.158
<i>to our universe...</i>

02:27:46.634 --> 02:27:47.836
<i>is you.</i>

02:27:50.672 --> 02:27:53.340
Things just got out of hand.

02:27:58.912 --> 02:28:00.948
