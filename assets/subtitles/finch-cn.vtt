如果在夜间出行是安全的你不觉得我早该知道吗？

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.041
芬奇
Finch.

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:20.586
这个隧道的最大高度是
Maximum height ofthis particular underpass

01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:22.462
4米
is 13 feet and 7 inches.

01:14:22.546 --> 01:14:24.840
根据这辆车的基本定制规格 我们…
With the basic customizationsof the vehicle, we're--

01:14:25.591 --> 01:14:27.176
芬奇
Finch!

01:14:33.473 --> 01:14:36.476
4米

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.228
-芬奇  -我做了什么？
-Finch?-What have I done?

01:14:47.446 --> 01:14:48.614
不 杰夫
No! No, Jeff!

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.838
我觉得他们已经走了 芬奇
I think they're gone, Finch.

01:16:39.266 --> 01:16:40.642
我们不可能活下来
We're not gonna make it.

01:16:48.859 --> 01:16:49.902
已经结束了
It's over.

01:16:54.489 --> 01:16:59.953
我太老了 我病得太重了我太累了 我已经走投无路了
I'm too old. I'm too sick.I'm too tired. I'm done.

01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:03.498
芬奇 要下雨了 你知道那意味着…
Finch, it's gonna rain.You know what that means--

01:17:03.582 --> 01:17:05.584
别说了…接受现实吧
Stop it. Stop it. Just accept it.

01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:07.836
已经结束了
It's over.

01:17:09.046 --> 01:17:10.047
不
No.

01:17:10.631 --> 01:17:11.757
我们不能放弃
We can't give up.

01:17:12.549 --> 01:17:14.927
我不允许你放弃
I will not allow you to give up.

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:16.094
你不允许？
You will not allow it?

01:17:16.178 --> 01:17:19.515
这轮不到你决定 因为你只是一部机器
Well, you don't get to decidebecause you're just a machine.

01:17:19.598 --> 01:17:21.850
机器人不能伤害人类
A robot cannot harm a human or,through inaction,

01:17:21.934 --> 01:17:23.352
也不能坐视人类受到伤害
allow a human to come to harm.

01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:24.436
闭嘴
Shut up!

01:18:31.628 --> 01:18:33.463
我能问你一个问题吗？
May I ask you something?

01:18:35.716 --> 01:18:38.552
你觉得我们能到达金门大桥吗？
Do you think we'll make itto the Golden Gate Bridge?

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:43.223
我认为我们能
I think we will.

01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:47.060
你想知道原因吗？
You wanna know why?

01:18:48.061 --> 01:18:51.857
因为我相信你 芬奇
Because I believe in you, Finch.

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:58.655
我能给你讲个故事吗？
Can I tell you a story?

01:19:01.825 --> 01:19:02.868
好的
Okay.

01:19:03.785 --> 01:19:05.120
很久以前
Once upon a time...

01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:08.332
爆发了太阳耀斑
there was a solar flare.

01:19:12.586 --> 01:19:19.301
但耀斑没有让人类灭亡这一切都是我们自己造成的
But the flare didn't finish us off.We did that to ourselves.

01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:25.432
有的人闭门不出
Some people hid and locked their doors.

01:19:25.516 --> 01:19:27.935
假装什么都没发生
Tried to pretendthat it wasn't really happening.

01:19:28.018 --> 01:19:29.645
那些人没有撑多久就死了
And they didn't last very long.

01:19:31.772 --> 01:19:34.149
我们其余人尽己所能存活下去
The rest of us did what we had to doto survive.

01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:37.778
我们四处搜刮物品 争抢剩下的东西
We scavenged and we fought overwhatever was left behind

01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:39.488
直到一切都抢光
until there was nothing left.

01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:46.370
我在搜一家超市
I was searching this supermarket.

01:19:47.246 --> 01:19:49.665
东西几乎已经被人拿光了
And the place had beenpretty well cleaned out,

01:19:49.748 --> 01:19:55.546
但走运的话 偶尔能找到被人漏掉的东西
but occasionally something gets overlookedand you get lucky.

01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:00.217
我发现了一袋面条 我发现了一袋面条
And I found a bag of noodles. And I found a bag of noodles.

01:20:03.136 --> 01:20:04.137
古德耶尔轮胎促销

01:20:04.221 --> 01:20:05.848
但在我离开前
But before I could leave...

01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:11.270
有个母亲带着孩子来了
this mother and her kid show up,

01:20:11.353 --> 01:20:14.690
她们推着一台购物车 装满了她们的东西
and they have a shopping cartfilled with their things.

01:20:14.773 --> 01:20:17.484
小女孩估计九岁都不到
The little girl couldn't have beenmore than nine years old.

01:20:18.569 --> 01:20:21.029
她背着一个粉色的独角兽图案背包
She had a pink unicorn backpack.

01:20:23.991 --> 01:20:26.451
她的手里握着枪
And she was holding a gun in her hands.

01:20:27.703 --> 01:20:31.832
我听见那个妈妈说：“记住 看到任何人
And I heard the mom say,"Remember, if you see anyone,

01:20:31.915 --> 01:20:35.210
用枪指着他们像我展示给你看的那样做 好吗？”
you point at themand you do like I showed you, okay?"

01:20:37.713 --> 01:20:39.923
然后我意识到 如果她看到我
And then I realized that if she sees me,

01:20:40.007 --> 01:20:43.218
小女孩会开枪射死我 拿走我的面条
this little girl's gonna shoot meand take my noodles.

01:20:44.887 --> 01:20:46.471
于是我藏起来了
So I hid.

01:20:48.307 --> 01:20:51.643
等她们走了再出来
And waited until they were done.

01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:58.609
但她们正要离开时有一辆旅行车驶来 停在外面
But as they were leaving,this station wagon pulled up.

01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:04.573
司机下车了 因为他看见了小女孩
And the driver got outbecause he'd seen the little girl.

01:21:06.909 --> 01:21:08.160
他在大叫
And he was yelling,

01:21:08.243 --> 01:21:12.164
他挥舞着一把霰弹枪 像疯子一样
and he was waving a shotgun aroundlike a crazy man.

01:21:13.582 --> 01:21:16.168
他看到购物车 想把东西据为己有
He'd seen the cartand he wanted what was in it.

01:21:16.251 --> 01:21:19.254
所以他大嚷：“交给我…”
So he was hollering,"Hand it over. Hand it over."

01:21:19.338 --> 01:21:22.424
然后那个妈妈跑过去 对他大喊
And then the mom ran upand she was yelling at him,

01:21:22.508 --> 01:21:23.967
“离我们远点”
"Leave us alone."

01:21:25.344 --> 01:21:28.055
小女孩很怕
And the little girl is terrified and...

01:21:29.223 --> 01:21:31.642
她不知道该用枪指着哪里
she didn't know where to point the gun.

01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:35.979
她在哭
She was crying.

01:21:37.356 --> 01:21:39.233
她们都在尖叫
And they were both screaming.

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.364
然后 砰砰几声
And then bang, bang, bang.

01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:58.585
一切都发生得那么快
It all happened so fast.

01:22:04.007 --> 01:22:08.971
等他离开后 我终于能来到她们身边
By the time he leftand I was able to get to them,

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.806
太迟了
it was too late.

01:22:22.526 --> 01:22:24.027
然后我听见一个声音
Then I heard this sound.

01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:29.366
微弱的哼哼声
This tiny whimpering...

01:22:33.161 --> 01:22:35.455
从小女孩的粉色背包里传出来
coming from the girl's pink backpack.

01:22:43.922 --> 01:22:45.424
于是我打开背包
And so I opened it.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:00.731
里面是一只颤抖的小家伙 里面是一只颤抖的小家伙
And there was this shivering,tiny, little thing. And there was this shivering,tiny, little thing.

01:23:03.442 --> 01:23:05.068
那么害怕
So frightened.

01:23:06.570 --> 01:23:07.988
那么孤单
And so alone.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.331
饥饿让人变成杀人犯
Hunger turned men into murderers.

01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:20.250
但是…
But made...

01:23:23.337 --> 01:23:24.630
让我变成懦夫
made me a coward.

01:23:32.888 --> 01:23:34.306
你怎么能相信这样的人？
How can you believe in that?

01:24:08.757 --> 01:24:09.842
旧金山

01:24:09.925 --> 01:24:10.968
看到了吗？
You see that?

01:24:13.011 --> 01:24:14.263
旧金山
San Francisco.

01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:17.182
芬奇
Finch.

01:24:18.684 --> 01:24:20.811
只有770公里了
Only 480 miles.

01:24:26.275 --> 01:24:31.864
亲爱的芬奇 我明年将路过旧金山我们能见个面吗？ 爸爸

01:24:31.947 --> 01:24:32.948
“爸爸”
"Dad."

01:24:34.908 --> 01:24:35.909
爸爸
Dad.

01:24:43.584 --> 01:24:46.837
紫外线辐射较低 非危险水平
UV radiation low. Non-critical.

01:25:10.527 --> 01:25:12.571
你应该来看看
I think you need to come and see this.

01:25:14.031 --> 01:25:15.490
-芬奇  -什么？
-Finch!-What?

01:25:17.326 --> 01:25:18.744
-什么？  -那里
-What?-Right there.

01:25:22.706 --> 01:25:24.333
我不是故意撞到它的
I didn't mean to hit it.

01:25:54.821 --> 01:25:56.031
你不是说…
I thought you said it...

01:25:57.199 --> 01:25:58.408
瑞士芝士
Swiss cheese.

01:26:17.302 --> 01:26:18.762
我不知道
I don't know.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.835
这太棒了 杰夫
This is excellent, Jeff.

01:28:13.794 --> 01:28:16.588
这是我很久以来所吃过最好的一顿饭了
This is the best meal I've hadin a long, long time.

01:28:24.638 --> 01:28:25.889
你知道吗？
Guess what?

01:28:25.973 --> 01:28:26.974
什么？
What?

01:28:29.434 --> 01:28:31.770
我昨晚在脑中看见了那个画面
I saw it in my head last night.

01:28:31.854 --> 01:28:33.272
在脑中？
In your head?

01:28:33.939 --> 01:28:38.026
我们三个在金门大桥上
The three of us were onthe Golden Gate Bridge,

01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:40.445
就像还没发生的一幅画
like a painting that hasn't been yet.

01:28:42.906 --> 01:28:43.991
哇
Wow!

01:28:46.368 --> 01:28:48.078
杰夫 你做梦了？
Jeff, you had a dream?

01:28:51.206 --> 01:28:53.500
我好震惊
That blows my mind.

01:28:54.126 --> 01:28:57.546
我真想看到五、六年后的你
I would love to see youfive or six years from now.

01:28:59.131 --> 01:29:00.924
我没有让人失望？ 我没有让人失望？
I'm not a disappointment? I'm not a disappointment?

01:29:01.008 --> 01:29:03.177
当然没有
Of course not. No.

01:29:04.386 --> 01:29:07.181
我不应该说你是机器
And I shouldn't have called you a machine.

01:29:09.057 --> 01:29:11.018
我能问你一件事吗？
May I ask you something?

01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:15.564
你说金门大桥的明信片是你叔叔寄的
You said that the Golden Gate Bridge cardwas from your uncle,

01:29:15.647 --> 01:29:19.651
但是它的背面落款是“爸爸”
but on the back it's signed "Dad."

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.529
为什么？
Why is that?

01:29:23.238 --> 01:29:25.741
老天 你不会错过一个细节 对吗？
Boy, you don't miss a thing, do you?

01:29:25.824 --> 01:29:27.242
对 我不会
No, I don't.

01:29:28.827 --> 01:29:32.456
好的 故事时间到
Well, I think it's time for another story.

01:29:38.295 --> 01:29:39.296
这个…
Well...

01:29:42.424 --> 01:29:47.596
我妈妈总说我爸爸的体内流着维京人的血
My mom always said my dadhad Viking blood in him.

01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:51.767
你没说“很久以前”
You didn't say, "Once upon a time."

01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:55.312
好的 很久以前
Okay. And once upon a time...

01:29:56.271 --> 01:29:57.272
他离开了我们
he left us.

01:29:59.733 --> 01:30:01.193
那是在我出生之前的事 那是在我出生之前的事
It was before I was born. It was before I was born.

01:30:02.194 --> 01:30:03.195
他参军了
He was in the army.

01:30:03.278 --> 01:30:07.866
据说他是什么工程师 建造大桥的
An engineer of some kind, evidently.Built bridges.

01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:11.119
他总是四处旅行 我们从未联络过
And he was always traveling.We never had any contact.

01:30:11.203 --> 01:30:17.751
然后 在我15岁生日那天突然收到这张明信片
And then on my 15th birthday,that postcard shows up out of the blue.

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:20.295
金门大桥的那张
The one with the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:30:20.754 --> 01:30:23.590
他在上面写道希望有天能和我见面
And he wrote on ithe hoped we could meet one day.

01:30:24.758 --> 01:30:29.346
在那个时候 我应该出发去看世界了
Meantime I was supposed togo off and see the world.

01:30:30.472 --> 01:30:32.808
他的落款是“爸爸”我把这张明信片视若珍宝
And he signed it "Dad" and I treasured it.

01:30:34.142 --> 01:30:37.729
其实 我年龄一到立即就去买了这身高档西服
In fact, as soon as I was old enough,I went out and I bought this fancy suit.

01:30:38.313 --> 01:30:41.066
心想我们终于相见的那天
And I thought, well,when we finally do meet,

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:44.653
我要给他留个好印象 让他为我自豪
I wanted to impress himand make him feel proud of me.

01:30:47.614 --> 01:30:49.449
那之后再也没有他的消息了
Never heard from him again.

01:30:54.705 --> 01:30:55.873
那你做到了吗？
And did you?

01:30:56.999 --> 01:30:58.333
做到什么？
Did I what?

01:30:58.417 --> 01:31:00.085
你去看世界了吗？ 你去看世界了吗？
Did you go see the world? Did you go see the world?

01:31:02.671 --> 01:31:05.132
我曾去过一次纽约
Well, I went to New York City once.

01:31:05.215 --> 01:31:07.134
-是吗？  -我不太喜欢那里
-Yeah?-I didn't much care for it.

01:31:07.217 --> 01:31:09.219
人多又脏
It was crowded and dirty.

01:31:10.345 --> 01:31:14.224
此外 我没怎么离开过密苏里
And apart from that I've never beenmuch further than Missouri.

01:31:14.308 --> 01:31:15.893
总是有各种各样的阻碍
But there was always something.

01:31:15.976 --> 01:31:21.481
我的健康、工作、妈妈、世界末日等等
You know, my health or my work,Mom, the end of the world.

01:31:25.694 --> 01:31:26.778
对 我…
Yeah, I...

01:31:28.572 --> 01:31:30.407
我一直没找到机会
I just never got around to it.

01:31:36.121 --> 01:31:38.832
其他明信片呢？为什么都是空白的？
What about the other postcards?Why are they all blank?

01:31:38.916 --> 01:31:43.921
我看到喜欢的明信片就会买下
Well, whenever I saw one I liked,I would buy it.

01:31:44.755 --> 01:31:48.258
像是收藏吧 某种人生愿望清单
You know, sort of a collection.Something for the bucket list, I guess.

01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:49.551
我也说不清
I don't know.

01:31:52.638 --> 01:31:55.057
我们人类就是充满各种矛盾
Like, we humansare full of contradictions.

01:31:58.936 --> 01:32:01.772
你已经可以跟我说出 你已经可以跟我说出
You see, you can already tell me You see, you can already tell me

01:32:01.855 --> 01:32:04.441
金门大桥上有多少颗铆钉
how many rivetsare in the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:32:04.525 --> 01:32:08.946
用了多长的悬索 桥有多高
And how many miles of cable were usedand how high it is.

01:32:09.571 --> 01:32:14.618
但是只有当你站在上面 看到它的美
But it's not until you actuallystand on it and see the beauty,

01:32:14.701 --> 01:32:19.081
听到悬索在风中歌唱…
and listen to the suspension cablessinging in the wind...

01:32:19.164 --> 01:32:20.582
这是一种体验
That's experience.

01:32:21.875 --> 01:32:23.710
是一种人类的体验
That's human experience.

01:32:23.794 --> 01:32:28.090
不只是想象 而是生活
It's not just imagining, it's living.

01:32:29.341 --> 01:32:33.720
但你还没去过金门大桥 芬奇
But you've never actually beento the Golden Gate Bridge, Finch.

01:32:36.098 --> 01:32:37.724
是的 杰夫 我没去过
No, Jeff, I've never been.

01:32:37.808 --> 01:32:39.184
谢谢
Thank you.

01:32:40.143 --> 01:32:43.188
正如我说的 人类充满矛盾
Like I said,humans are full of contradictions.
