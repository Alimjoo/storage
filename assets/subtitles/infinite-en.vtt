00:53.530 --> 00:55.960
There are among us a people,

00:56.010 --> 01:00.010
gifted with a perfect memory  of all their past lives.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.540
They call themselves  Infinites.

01:05.970 --> 01:09.800
Among the Infinites,  two groups have vied for power.

01:09.850 --> 01:12.370
On one side the Believers,

01:12.420 --> 01:13.940
dedicated  to using their knowledge

01:13.980 --> 01:17.330
for the protection and growth  of all humanity.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.810
Against them  stand the Nihilists,

01:19.860 --> 01:22.640
who see this power  as a curse.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.650
New technologies  have given the Nihilists

01:25.690 --> 01:28.690
an opportunity  to end all life on earth.

01:29.650 --> 01:32.610
And the race is on  for its control.

02:05.380 --> 02:06.770
Treadway,  tell me you got it.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.950
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.  I got it.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.050
Might be delayed a little.  I'm headed to meet you now.

02:23.090 --> 02:24.100
Copy that.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.070
Treadway, you okay?

02:47.120 --> 02:49.600
We can't let them  get the Egg back.

02:50.950 --> 02:53.780
I can't believe  Bathurst would go this far.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.610
He's not the man  we remember.

02:56.130 --> 02:57.130

Get to the base of the crane. Treadway, listen.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.320
Do not go up that bridge.

05:33.630 --> 05:35.980
Treadway? Treadway?

05:39.420 --> 05:41.550
Abel, listen to me.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.990
If I fail, look inside.

05:44.030 --> 05:46.210
I don't know what miracle  you think you're gonna pull off,

05:46.250 --> 05:49.170
but there's a 150-foot gap  in front of you.

05:49.210 --> 05:50.950
What is his plan?

06:49.970 --> 06:51.930
Leona. Please.

06:53.670 --> 06:57.020
Leona, wake up.  Wake up.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.970
I'll find you  in the Beginning.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.400
I love you.

07:50.550 --> 07:55.560
Did you ever have  a dream so real  it felt like a memory?

07:57.080 --> 08:00.480
You ever catch yourself  in the mirror  and it's a surprise?

08:01.520 --> 08:04.040
Like you expected to see  someone else's face

08:04.090 --> 08:06.130
staring back at you.

08:09.480 --> 08:13.710
All these people  all going somewhere,  all doing something.

08:13.750 --> 08:16.320
But what does it all add up to?

08:16.360 --> 08:20.060
Maybe if I knew the answer,  all the little things  might click together.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.320
They might make sense.

08:22.370 --> 08:24.890
Hey. Hi. Evan. Right on time.

08:24.930 --> 08:26.980
Nice to see you.  How are ya?

08:27.020 --> 08:29.500
Any trouble getting here?No. No, not at all.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.720
Okay.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.860
Third interview this week.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.730
Here he is. Hey, gentlemen.

08:34.770 --> 08:36.080
Hey. How are you?

08:36.120 --> 08:38.160
Pleasure to meet you.Evan, great to meet you.

08:38.210 --> 08:40.990
Thank you so much  for your time.  I really appreciate it.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.910
Wow. Beautiful place  you have here.Thank you.

08:42.950 --> 08:46.560
Absolutely gorgeous.I just got a couple questions  if you don't mind.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.040
Yeah, of course.

08:48.090 --> 08:53.090
There are a couple  of question marks  in your past.

08:53.570 --> 08:55.050
I recognize that.

08:55.090 --> 08:58.620
You're the first face  people see

08:58.660 --> 09:01.010
when they walk  into my restaurant.

09:01.060 --> 09:02.750
And they'd be greeted  with a smile.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.100
I have had some issues  in the past.

09:05.150 --> 09:08.110
I did  a full background check  on you, Mr. McCauley.

09:08.150 --> 09:11.460
I spoke to some  of your past employers.

09:11.500 --> 09:15.550
And you know what?  They all said  the same thing.

09:15.590 --> 09:18.070
I'm interested to hear  what they had to say.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.510
They say you're great!

09:19.550 --> 09:22.080
They say you're smart.  He's a smart guy.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.950
Smart guy right here, huh?

09:23.990 --> 09:27.950
That's all good.  I guess I've got the job then.  When do I start?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.480
Tell me about the customer  you attacked.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.610
He assaulted a waitress.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.960
So you broke his arm.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.220
I did.  It was unintentional.

09:37.270 --> 09:40.620
Excuse me,  but he grabbed her ass.

09:40.660 --> 09:42.620
I asked him to leave politely.

09:42.660 --> 09:46.490
He put his hands on me.  No charges were ever filed.  Everything was dismissed.

09:46.540 --> 09:52.630
So you just walked out  of a shift at Locanda  and you-- you never came back?

09:52.670 --> 09:54.760
I had a personal issue.  That was six years ago.

09:54.810 --> 09:59.070
Yeah, your manager told me  that you were institutionalized.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.730
For two weeks.

10:00.770 --> 10:04.380
Two weeks.  Melanie, it's just two weeks.  Just two weeks.

10:04.420 --> 10:08.520
Look. My struggles  with mental illness  are a part of my past.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.820
I haven't had so much  as an eye twitch since.

10:10.870 --> 10:14.740
I think, if anything, getting  through what I've been through  only makes me stronger.

10:14.780 --> 10:19.920
And I am 100% confident  in my ability to manage here.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.570
Thanks for coming in today,  Evan.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.270
Please. Look, I know  what it looks like.

10:24.310 --> 10:27.060
But my illness isn't an issue  you have to worry about.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.580
I promise you--Hey, we'll be  in touch, okay?

10:34.720 --> 10:37.020
No, you won't.

10:37.540 --> 10:38.550
Excuse me?

10:38.590 --> 10:41.370
I know the brush-off  when I hear it.

10:41.420 --> 10:46.730
Mr. McCauley,  you are clearly awesome  at dealing with conflict.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.080
You have no idea.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.910
Thanks for coming in.

10:49.950 --> 10:53.600
But you're right.  I don't think I will need  to be calling you.

10:54.740 --> 10:56.090
You think you know my story

10:56.130 --> 10:57.520
because you ran  a background check

10:57.560 --> 10:59.570
and made a couple  of phone calls?

10:59.610 --> 11:03.270
I knew yours when I shook  your well-moisturized hand.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.440
Thank you for your time.

11:06.050 --> 11:08.360
I get it. I do.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.320
Who's going to hire  a diagnosed schizophrenic  with a history of violence,

11:11.360 --> 11:14.890
when there's  a dozen candidates out there  with sparkling clean records?

11:14.930 --> 11:19.720
But what's really on my mind  is if I can't get a job,  I can't pay rent this month.

11:21.460 --> 11:24.460
I mean, dry-cleaning this suit  wasn't exactly free.

11:26.810 --> 11:30.600
And more than that,  I've gotta get something  together real quick,

11:30.640 --> 11:32.990
because these meds,  they're running out.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.340
And once they do,  shit gets real.

11:56.410 --> 11:59.320
Are there things  you just know how to do?

12:01.280 --> 12:03.720
Like, no one's  ever showed you.

12:03.760 --> 12:07.720
Somehow each step  in the process makes sense.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.700
Like you're remembering it.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.350
Not learning it.

12:45.670 --> 12:48.240
For reals, you really  made that shit yourself, man?

12:48.280 --> 12:50.460
Yep.Damn.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.510
Hey, yo, Ronny.  Yo, Ronny.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.770
Evan, man.Hey.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.470
As requested.

12:58.510 --> 13:01.120
Kimotsuki-styled iron.  Handcrafted.

13:01.170 --> 13:02.520
One of a kind.

13:03.730 --> 13:05.650
Oh, hell, yeah.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.830
Hattori Hanzo, yo? Ooh!

13:10.870 --> 13:12.220
Damn.

13:12.260 --> 13:13.530
Goddamn.Nice.

13:13.570 --> 13:14.920
Get off me.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.530
Now, let's get this man paid.

13:18.180 --> 13:19.530
You get high off this shit?

13:19.580 --> 13:21.840
No. Clozapine.  It's an antipsychotic.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.840
You get paid in pills?

13:23.890 --> 13:26.540
Evan here's on "Ronny-care."

13:26.580 --> 13:28.410
Yeah. Dr. Ronny.

13:28.450 --> 13:30.850
Why don't you, like,  get them at Duane Reade?

13:30.890 --> 13:33.550
Because Evan don't  wanna talk to shrinks  every two weeks. Right?

13:33.590 --> 13:36.200
Yeah. Evan can't afford  400 bucks a month  on a scrip.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.420
Yo. Wikipedia.

13:38.460 --> 13:42.210
What's the capital  of "Brakina Fatso"? Yeah.

13:42.250 --> 13:46.080
It's pronounced  Burkina Faso. Ouagadougou.  Could I have my pills, please?

13:48.210 --> 13:50.830
Shit, man.  Forgot my count, man.

13:50.870 --> 13:52.440
You made that up.

13:54.740 --> 13:56.440
Damn, man!

13:57.220 --> 13:59.010
Nah.

13:59.050 --> 14:02.840
Homeboy knows everything.  He a freak.

14:03.450 --> 14:05.190
How do you know so much?

14:05.230 --> 14:08.580
Honestly, I wish I knew.  Makes me nuts.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.630
Could I have my pills, please.

14:13.940 --> 14:18.420
Dang, girl.  You eyeballin' my boy  like he a steak dinner.

14:19.380 --> 14:23.210
Yo, yo.  What's gunpowder made of?

14:23.250 --> 14:26.900
74% potassium nitrate,  13% charcoal.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.080
Okay.Damn. Impressive, man.

14:33.820 --> 14:35.650
I said eyes on me.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.650
Come on, Ronny.

14:37.700 --> 14:40.350
There you go, man.  Sixty packages.

14:41.090 --> 14:42.350
That's only 55.

14:43.140 --> 14:44.440
For real?

14:45.710 --> 14:46.620
Close enough.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.140
The hell it is.  I live on those.

14:50.230 --> 14:51.930
Sixty. Hey.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.240
Hey.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.890
You want the real thing,  right? That is it.

14:55.930 --> 14:58.940
That's folded over 70 times.  Carbon-treated steel.

14:58.980 --> 15:00.760
Take your damn hands off me.

15:00.810 --> 15:03.460
You better tell your boy  to learn how to count.

15:03.510 --> 15:05.120
The deal is for 60 bags.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.340
Yeah?  Well, that's all we got.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.820
You don't like it,  you can go back to Bellevue.

15:13.210 --> 15:15.000
Get the gat on homeboy.

15:15.950 --> 15:18.390
I wanna test this shit out.

15:22.350 --> 15:25.620
Yo, what's gunpowder  made of?

15:25.660 --> 15:26.920
Hold out your arm.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.490
Showtime.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.580
Hold out your arm.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.150
Get up.

15:37.190 --> 15:40.670
Put your arm there, huh?  It's the neck or arm, baby.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.810
You choose.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.290
Hey, Ronny.  That's not a toy, bro.

15:45.330 --> 15:46.720
Mind your business, Evan.

15:46.770 --> 15:48.730
Come on, Ronny.  This ain't funny.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.260
Oh, God!  My fingers!

16:01.690 --> 16:03.000
I think it works,  huh, Ronny?

16:03.040 --> 16:05.090
Cut my goddamn fingers off, man!

16:05.130 --> 16:08.920
You'll be all right.  Hey, sweetheart,  why don't you head on home now.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.700
You're trippin', bro.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.100
You are done, homey.  You're a dead fool.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.580
I don't know, Ronny.  You're talking to a guy

16:15.620 --> 16:17.800
who buys antipsychotic  medication from you.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.840
I'm feeling  a little unbalanced  right now.

16:20.890 --> 16:24.200
Maybe the best way  to get the voices in my head  to stop talking

16:24.240 --> 16:25.680
is to cut yours off.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.550
Do you think it would help?

16:28.550 --> 16:31.590
No. Don't fight.  Don't shoot.  It's cool.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.470
We're cool, man.  We're cool. All right?

16:33.510 --> 16:37.120
Hey, dickhead.  Grab my pills. Now.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.560
There you go.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.520
You're crazy, man.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.780
If I was crazy,  I'd have chopped you up in  little pieces a long time ago.

16:43.820 --> 16:45.090
Give me my pills.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.870
Now, you listen to me, Ronny.  I'm not crazy, okay?

16:48.920 --> 16:52.010
Mm-hmm.I'm just misunderstood.  All right?

17:45.580 --> 17:47.450
Help!Leona!

17:51.020 --> 17:53.110
Oh!

18:21.830 --> 18:26.540
NYPD picked up  an Evan McCauley.  Drug deal gone south.

18:27.450 --> 18:29.760
Cops found a sword on him.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.540
Blade was made with a process

18:32.580 --> 18:35.980
hasn't been used  since, uh, Edo Japan.

18:36.020 --> 18:38.160
So?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.680
He claims he forged it himself.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.160
Another broker-turned-hipster  blacksmith.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.380
Oh, ye of little faith.  Are you seeing this, Nora?

18:47.210 --> 18:50.340
Treadway?Precisely.

18:50.390 --> 18:53.870
If we know, Bathurst knows.

18:53.910 --> 18:55.960
Be careful.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.650
Thanks, Mom.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.500
Tell us  when you're done, sir.

19:21.550 --> 19:23.590
Can I get my phone call?

19:24.590 --> 19:27.160
Supposed to get  a phone call.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.960
You're dressed way too nice  to be an NYPD detective, so...

19:45.270 --> 19:46.700
must be a doctor.

19:48.660 --> 19:50.140
Not a thing?

19:51.270 --> 19:53.620
No recognition at all?

19:56.020 --> 19:58.580
I think  I should feel hurt.

20:00.720 --> 20:04.590
Do you remember... Syracuse?

20:04.630 --> 20:06.420
Syracuse.

20:06.460 --> 20:07.810
The siege.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.810
Second Punic War.

20:12.290 --> 20:13.770
Where we first met.

20:13.820 --> 20:16.950
Well, not quite the thrill ride  of the First Punic War,

20:16.990 --> 20:19.210
but, hey,  sequels are tough, huh?

20:20.080 --> 20:21.300
You disappoint me.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.430
Well, join the club.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.130
I notice...

20:26.660 --> 20:28.130
you didn't sign it.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.180
Then again...

20:34.750 --> 20:37.060
craftsmanship like this...

20:38.360 --> 20:41.370
you didn't need to, did you?

20:41.410 --> 20:44.240
I made a sword.  Is that a crime?

20:45.670 --> 20:48.110
Evan McCauley.

20:48.850 --> 20:52.200
Diagnosed with schizophrenia  at 14...

20:52.990 --> 20:56.030
after carving the words  Look inside

20:56.080 --> 20:59.250
into your chest  with a box cutter.

20:59.990 --> 21:03.470
Electroshock proved unhelpful.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.220
But these...

21:06.350 --> 21:08.040
are not bad, eh?

21:12.880 --> 21:15.530
Doctor, can I--Please. Go ahead.

21:18.270 --> 21:22.620
At 16, attempted suicide  via car crash,

21:22.670 --> 21:26.020
necessitating the steel plate  in your skull.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.930
Spent the rest  of your early life

21:28.980 --> 21:33.200
bouncing around  between psych hospitals  and foster homes.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.330
Well, I only cut  a couple of his fingers off.

21:35.380 --> 21:38.640
I don't think I'm gonna need  to plead insanity on this one,  am I, Doctor?

21:38.680 --> 21:39.990
I'm curious.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.770
Look inside.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.870
Why those words?Why not?

22:12.410 --> 22:16.330
Which one of these...  is yours?

22:17.370 --> 22:20.380
You can skip the--  whatever the hell this is

22:20.420 --> 22:23.250
because none of that  is mine.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.780
You're not supposed  to have that in here.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.350
What's going on here?

22:39.140 --> 22:40.350
Hey, Officer.

22:58.150 --> 23:01.640
Hey, what the hell  is going on here?

23:07.420 --> 23:08.820
Pick it up.

23:09.470 --> 23:10.690
What?

23:11.730 --> 23:13.080
Pick it up.

23:18.780 --> 23:20.130
Paris.

23:20.180 --> 23:21.960
1794.

23:22.830 --> 23:25.010
The last meal  of the Comte d'Anjou.

23:29.660 --> 23:30.970
A Bordeaux.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.150
Not a bad choice  for a last meal.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.410
Was it yours?

23:38.370 --> 23:41.370
I wish I knew  what you were talking about,  but I don't know what to tell--

23:41.420 --> 23:42.630
Jesus!

23:42.680 --> 23:45.070
Every time you say,  I don't know,

23:45.680 --> 23:48.250
this trigger  gets pulled.

23:52.820 --> 23:54.650
Is it yours?I don't know--

23:54.690 --> 23:56.520
Are you out of your mind?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.870
We're in a police station!  Hello! Officer!The room is soundproof!

23:58.910 --> 24:04.390
They won't even hear it  when I put 250 grams of lead  through the back of your skull.

24:10.530 --> 24:13.140
Is it yours?Yes. Okay, yes, it's mine.

24:13.190 --> 24:14.490
Are you happy?

24:14.540 --> 24:15.710
Jesus!

24:17.580 --> 24:20.020
Lying... won't help.

24:20.060 --> 24:25.280
Look. I'm just a guy  who was at the wrong place  at the wrong time. That's all.

24:25.330 --> 24:26.940
Last chance, Evan.

24:28.510 --> 24:32.200
Is... it... yours?

25:12.590 --> 25:14.460
There's the Treadway I know!

25:23.260 --> 25:26.260
Little trick I learned from you.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.530
Hello, old friend.

25:53.630 --> 25:55.030
Whoa!

25:58.680 --> 26:00.120
Get in!

26:13.390 --> 26:14.920
Hold on.Shit!

26:34.150 --> 26:35.330
Go! Turn! Turn!

26:48.690 --> 26:49.860
Oh, shit!

26:52.610 --> 26:54.350
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:55.830 --> 26:56.960
Go! Go!

27:01.880 --> 27:04.010
Inside!

27:04.050 --> 27:06.580
Hold tight.Oh, sh...

27:16.800 --> 27:18.500
Cover!

27:20.200 --> 27:22.370
What are you waiting for?  Come on, let's go!

27:22.420 --> 27:24.290
Go the other way!Take the wheel.

27:24.330 --> 27:26.160
What? Get out of the car!

27:26.200 --> 27:29.380
Yeah, sure.  Retractable steering wheel.  No problem. That's normal.

27:32.300 --> 27:35.040
Reverse.Shoot that son of a bitch.

27:39.830 --> 27:42.870
Move! Clear the street!

27:42.920 --> 27:44.920
Shoot the driver!

27:49.620 --> 27:51.100
Jesus Christ!

27:54.970 --> 27:56.930
Who are they?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.500
Relax, it's bulletproof.

28:06.070 --> 28:07.640
180 now!

28:24.790 --> 28:25.960
Don't stop.

29:10.610 --> 29:12.270
Can I ask you a question?Yeah, sure.

29:12.310 --> 29:13.700
Who the hell are you?

29:13.750 --> 29:15.180
I'm Nora Brightman.

29:15.230 --> 29:17.660
Okay. But who was  that dude back there?

29:17.710 --> 29:20.060
Bathurst.  You didn't recognize him?

29:20.100 --> 29:22.280
No, I didn't.  But clearly you did.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.240
Well, you've known him  a long time.

29:24.280 --> 29:27.330
I've never seen that man  before in my life.  Him, I think I'd remember.

29:27.370 --> 29:29.410
Well, not in this life,  maybe.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.630
Oh, no. Maybe I bumped into him  during the Second Punic War?

29:31.680 --> 29:33.980
Or maybe it was  the French Revolution.  I'm bad with dates.

29:34.030 --> 29:37.250
You remember that?No. I don't remember  the French Revolution.

29:37.290 --> 29:39.900
I figured it out.  I see now. I get it.

29:39.950 --> 29:42.210
You do?None of this is real.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.080
It's a psychotic break.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.650
I'm gonna wake up  in a hospital somewhere,  drooling all over myself,

29:46.690 --> 29:48.780
strung out on lithium.Is that easier to believe

29:48.830 --> 29:50.960
than the idea that maybe  destiny has something  more in store for you?

29:51.000 --> 29:54.480
Destiny? Where I come from,  we got bills to pay,  rent to make.

29:54.530 --> 29:57.440
Nobody's got time for destiny.That's a shame.

30:12.890 --> 30:15.460
I know you've been  looking for answers,  Evan.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.810
But you're not crazy.  You never have been.

30:17.850 --> 30:20.770
No, I'm not crazy.  I'm just delusional.

30:20.810 --> 30:23.250
Do you ever find yourself  drawn to places  you've never been?

30:23.290 --> 30:26.300
Do you ever see  a picture of a place  and just know you've been there?

30:26.340 --> 30:27.600
Do you know things  you shouldn't?

30:27.650 --> 30:29.740
Do you pick up things fast,  almost as if

30:29.780 --> 30:32.520
you're remembering skills,  not learning them?

30:32.560 --> 30:34.570
I've told  a dozen therapists this.

30:34.610 --> 30:37.090
I've been analyzed  every way possible,  a hundred times over.

30:37.130 --> 30:38.530
It doesn't mean anything.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.880
Do you dream  in other languages?

30:40.920 --> 30:44.140
[speaks Russian,  Japanese]

30:44.190 --> 30:47.410
That's what schizophrenia is.  Different people, same head.

30:47.450 --> 30:50.930
What if it were  the same person,  different lives?

30:50.970 --> 30:53.890
You're talking  about reincarnation.Yeah.

30:53.930 --> 30:56.590
You can forge a sword  because you were  a blacksmith.

30:56.630 --> 30:59.590
You speak Russian  because you were Russian.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.330
Look, I hate to break it to you.

31:01.380 --> 31:04.420
It's a comforting idea,  souls moving from one body  to the next.

31:04.470 --> 31:08.340
But it's basically just  a spiritual equivalent of  better luck next time. Okay?

31:08.380 --> 31:10.080
Nothing more and nothing less.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.080
Feel safe warm and inside  all that cynicism?I do, actually.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.520
And how's that  working out for you?In the grand scheme of things?

31:15.560 --> 31:17.440
Like big-picture shit?  Not so great.

31:17.480 --> 31:19.570
But I'm good. I'm surviving.

31:20.920 --> 31:25.180
The visions you've had  your entire life, Evan,  aren't hallucinations.

31:25.230 --> 31:26.660
They're memories.

31:27.660 --> 31:30.320
So, you're saying  that a hundred doctors  were wrong?

31:30.360 --> 31:35.280
Fifty medications didn't work  because I'm really a  reincarnated Russian blacksmith?

31:35.800 --> 31:37.150
This is real.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.940
I'm real.

31:39.980 --> 31:43.460
Oh, yeah? This is  no version of reincarnation  I've ever heard of.

31:43.510 --> 31:44.900
Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh.

31:44.940 --> 31:47.680
They believe each life begins  with a clean slate.

31:47.730 --> 31:50.730
The answers you've been  looking for all your life...

31:51.730 --> 31:54.820
all you gotta do  is get on that plane.

31:57.430 --> 32:00.300
You know what I'm really  asking myself right now is?

32:00.350 --> 32:03.790
What if the craziest thing  I've ever heard--  and this is some crazy shit--

32:03.830 --> 32:06.570
is actually  the first thing that's  ever made any goddamn sense?

32:09.180 --> 32:13.490
I don't gotta go feed the cat,  so... let's go.

32:40.740 --> 32:41.960
Go on.

32:43.740 --> 32:48.570
[speaking,  gurgling, choking]

32:51.660 --> 32:54.400
[speaking, gurgling,  choking continue]

33:03.500 --> 33:05.980
They left  from a private airport.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.890
It was an unlisted flight.

33:09.590 --> 33:10.940
She was there fast.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.340
Too fast.

33:14.380 --> 33:18.080
The sword hadn't been  in the system  for more than a few hours.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.780
Then they have a base  here in New York.I want it found.

33:20.820 --> 33:24.260
It will lead us  to Evan McCauley.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.260
He will lead us  to the Egg.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.960
Again.

33:48.370 --> 33:50.590
We call ourselves  the Infinite.

33:50.630 --> 33:53.160
Less than 500 souls  from across the globe,

33:53.200 --> 33:57.470
all born with the ability  to remember all our past lives

33:57.510 --> 34:00.340
and the skills we've learned  in each of them.

34:00.380 --> 34:02.120
There are two groups  within the Infinites:

34:02.170 --> 34:07.080
Bathurst and the Nihilists,  who just want the world to end,

34:07.130 --> 34:09.610
and us... the Believers.

34:10.220 --> 34:11.960
And what is it  that we believe?

34:12.000 --> 34:15.660
We believe that our gift  is a responsibility.

34:15.700 --> 34:18.440
That it's up to us  to leave humanity

34:18.490 --> 34:21.320
better off than we found it.Yeah.

34:22.450 --> 34:24.540
I think  I'm gonna need these.

34:57.310 --> 34:59.790
Hey.Hey.

34:59.830 --> 35:00.920
Thanks.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.190
Wow. It's a long way  from Arthur Avenue.

35:07.270 --> 35:08.800
It always blows  my mind.

35:09.710 --> 35:11.930
We call it the Hub.

35:16.590 --> 35:19.720
This is the place  where you're gonna get  your memories back, Evan.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.680
We'll be landing soon.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.140
Recognize anything?I'm pretty sure  I'd remember this.

35:43.180 --> 35:45.750
It used to be dedicated  to scientific research.

35:45.790 --> 35:48.050
Anthropology and linguistics.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.230
All of us using  what we've learned.

35:50.270 --> 35:53.620
Life after life  for the advancement  of mankind.

35:53.670 --> 35:55.100
And what is it now?

35:56.060 --> 35:59.110
Headquarters  for the losing side  in the war.

36:03.590 --> 36:06.030
Bathurst is the master  of combat.

36:06.070 --> 36:07.550
Hundreds of lifetimes.

36:15.950 --> 36:18.130
You must be prepared  for everything.

36:26.530 --> 36:28.570
He's the apex predator  in our world.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.970
Again.

36:41.670 --> 36:43.200
Why are they bowing?

36:43.240 --> 36:45.760
They're hoping  you're Heinrich Treadway.

36:45.810 --> 36:47.940
Again!Reincarnated.

36:47.980 --> 36:49.720
Heinrich?

36:49.770 --> 36:52.070
It was a popular name  in the '50s.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.600
In the '50s.

36:53.640 --> 36:57.040
Great for rock 'n' roll,  but lousy for names,  I guess.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.260
The 1750s.

37:02.170 --> 37:04.830
What do I know  that you need so bad?

37:04.870 --> 37:07.830
That's why you're here--  to find out.

37:30.980 --> 37:34.990
This is Treadway's room.Are you asking me  or telling me?

37:35.030 --> 37:38.340
I must've really screwed up  on my last incarnation.

37:38.380 --> 37:39.900
Why would you say that?

37:40.690 --> 37:42.990
Have you seen where I live  in this life?

37:48.960 --> 37:51.920
That's Treadway's  Himalaya diary.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.570
That was me.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.140
When I was Leona Warrick.

38:01.450 --> 38:03.970
And that was Treadway.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.630
Two days after that picture  was taken,

38:13.680 --> 38:15.550
Treadway saved my life.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.600
There's a reason  you picked that book.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.900
All this tells me  is what he did.

38:22.950 --> 38:24.950
None of it tells me  who he was.

38:24.990 --> 38:27.910
Here we can study  anything and everything.

38:27.950 --> 38:31.390
Space, time, scale.  It's all relevant.

38:32.130 --> 38:34.220
That doesn't seem  like much.

38:34.260 --> 38:36.530
Welcome to my virtual sandbox.

38:36.570 --> 38:38.400
Name's Garrick.Hi.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.880
Garrick is our head  of technology and research.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.970
He doesn't  look like much.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.840
Goddamn, it's good  to see you again.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.360
It's nice to meet you too.

38:48.410 --> 38:52.150
Don't worry.  All this shit,  it just gets weirder.

38:52.190 --> 38:53.500
Okay.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.980
Now let's get started.

38:55.020 --> 38:56.070
Follow me.

38:59.510 --> 39:01.290
Stand there for me,  please.

39:01.990 --> 39:03.030
Okay.

39:19.830 --> 39:22.010
That's the guy  from the police station.

39:22.050 --> 39:25.270
Bathurst.  He and Treadway  were once friends.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.710
A dozen lifetimes.  Wars, peace.

39:27.750 --> 39:31.360
They stood together at  some of the greatest moments  in human history.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.060
Then Bathurst lost faith.

39:34.110 --> 39:38.110
For the last 300 years,  he's been looking  for a way out.

39:38.150 --> 39:40.900
He needed a way  to stop reincarnating.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.770
He wants it all to end.

39:42.810 --> 39:45.250
That's why he made this.

40:15.410 --> 40:19.980
The Egg,  designed to kill every  living thing on earth.

40:20.670 --> 40:23.150
That seems a little drastic.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.240
If there's nothing left alive,

40:25.290 --> 40:28.250
there's nothing left  to reincarnate into.

40:30.470 --> 40:34.820
It attacks life  at the source-- DNA--

40:34.860 --> 40:37.470
unwinding the very fabric  of existence.

40:37.520 --> 40:41.560
Every plant, every animal  every person.

40:41.610 --> 40:42.650
Mama!

40:42.700 --> 40:44.480
Jordan!

40:47.530 --> 40:49.010
I'm coming!

40:55.670 --> 40:57.410
Like unplugging a computer

40:57.450 --> 40:59.190
when a program freezes.

40:59.230 --> 41:00.980
Only when he pulls this plug,

41:01.020 --> 41:03.460
seven billion people  will go with him.

41:04.980 --> 41:07.760
Everything it kills  accelerates the process.

41:12.120 --> 41:15.860
God! Holy shit,  that felt freakin' real!

41:15.900 --> 41:18.820
Without you, none of us  would be here right now.

41:18.860 --> 41:20.170
What are you  talking about?

41:20.210 --> 41:22.870
Last cycle,  you raided Bathurst's lab,

41:22.910 --> 41:26.260
stole the Egg,  killed his Einstein and  everyone who helped build it,

41:26.300 --> 41:28.390
leaving him with no way  to recreate it.

41:28.440 --> 41:31.920
You took the secret  of the Egg's whereabouts  to your grave.

41:31.960 --> 41:34.880
Bathurst spent  this entire lifetime  looking for it.

41:34.920 --> 41:38.400
And he's getting closer  and closer to finding it  every day.

41:38.450 --> 41:40.540
That's why he  tracked you down  in New York.

41:40.580 --> 41:43.190
So I get on the plane,  you get all my memories back,

41:43.230 --> 41:45.280
and I save  the whole entire world,  right? That's it?

41:45.320 --> 41:46.760
That's pretty much  basically it, right?

41:46.800 --> 41:48.680
Told you it was  gonna get weird.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.150
So, what now?

41:53.590 --> 41:55.770
Tell me good news, Nora.

41:55.810 --> 41:59.900
Bryan Porter.  Treadway had a gift  with steel, didn't he?

41:59.950 --> 42:04.520
Impeccable. Your friends  in the NYPD were certainly  impressed with it.

42:04.560 --> 42:08.780
Unfortunately,  their encryption skills  are less than impeccable.

42:09.650 --> 42:11.480
Led us right to you.

42:21.710 --> 42:25.230
You do know we have easier ways  of doing things now, right?

42:25.840 --> 42:27.100
Newer...

42:27.890 --> 42:30.500
almost never means better.

42:39.510 --> 42:42.950
We're going to uncover  Evan McCauley's location.

42:42.990 --> 42:45.300
We'll brute-force  your encryption.

42:46.560 --> 42:50.300
But I'd consider it...  a courtesy...

42:51.350 --> 42:52.390
if you just...

42:53.780 --> 42:55.390
sped the process up.

42:58.310 --> 43:00.180
Tell us where he is.

43:08.150 --> 43:10.540
Okay.

43:11.890 --> 43:13.540
I know where he is.

43:16.500 --> 43:17.590
Of course I do.

43:18.370 --> 43:22.120
I know exactly where he is.  I just...

43:25.030 --> 43:26.860
I, um...

43:26.900 --> 43:30.990
I sometimes have difficulties...

43:31.040 --> 43:32.740
with my memory.

43:32.780 --> 43:33.950
Memory.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.650
I remember

43:35.700 --> 43:38.000
when you used to  gather honey

43:38.050 --> 43:40.350
on the fields  of Marathon.

43:41.830 --> 43:46.400
Just another reminder  of how nothing  stays the same.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.200
Would you care  for some?

44:03.070 --> 44:05.550
You know what  real torture is?

44:05.590 --> 44:06.990
Listening to you?

44:07.030 --> 44:12.120
Real torture...  isn't physical pain,

44:12.170 --> 44:14.950
but human stupidity.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.480
Being surrounded by it,  engulfed in it.

44:18.520 --> 44:21.260
Lifetime after lifetime.

44:21.310 --> 44:25.140
People with their  idiot grins!

44:25.180 --> 44:27.700
Their infuriating  pleasantries!

44:27.750 --> 44:29.750
Their need for approval!

44:29.790 --> 44:33.620
Their unctuous attempts  to be loved and validated!

44:33.670 --> 44:37.370
They are walking,  talking obituaries...

44:37.410 --> 44:40.590
...on the back page  of a dying newspaper,

44:40.630 --> 44:44.550
at the bottom of a birdcage,  in the corner of  a filthy living room

44:44.590 --> 44:45.850
of a hoarder cat lady!

44:45.900 --> 44:48.550
And we are forced...You'll never understand...

44:48.590 --> 44:51.860
...to live amongst them over......friendship, love.

44:51.900 --> 44:53.640
...and over endlessly.

44:53.690 --> 44:56.040
That is the true...You still don't understand  about faith!

44:56.080 --> 44:57.730
...definition of torture.

44:57.780 --> 45:01.260
Faith! Blah, blah, blah!

45:01.300 --> 45:02.520
Faith!

45:03.610 --> 45:04.700
Faith.

45:06.180 --> 45:08.740
I'm tired of faith.

45:08.790 --> 45:12.490
God must show me  his face.

45:25.890 --> 45:29.590
But thank you...  for enlightening me.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.220
You kept  his fucking body?

45:49.260 --> 45:50.700
Sexy son of a bitch,  isn't he?

45:50.740 --> 45:52.660
No. He's a dead guy  floating in water.

45:52.700 --> 45:54.620
That's pretty much  my worst nightmare.

45:54.660 --> 45:57.530
Actually,  it's a crotonic acid matrix.  Keeps the cells alive.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.710
Oh. That makes it  that much better.  Thank you.

45:59.750 --> 46:03.060
We're trying to understand  the science behind what we are.

46:09.850 --> 46:14.330
Treadway believed  that humans are capable of  so much more than we realized.

46:14.380 --> 46:17.380
Is this what  you're telling me? I'm not  living up to my potential?

46:17.420 --> 46:19.420
I've heard that speech before.

46:19.470 --> 46:23.780
Treadway pushed  past boundaries others might  call paranormal, superhuman.

46:23.820 --> 46:26.690
He can manipulate the energy  of the world around him.

46:26.740 --> 46:28.390
I don't even know  what that means.

46:28.430 --> 46:30.300
What it means  is you'll have skills

46:30.350 --> 46:33.000
beyond anything  you've ever imagined.

46:33.050 --> 46:35.350
Those abilities  are very deep.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.440
Below the conscious level.

46:37.490 --> 46:40.920
I'm down.  How do we get them back?

46:42.620 --> 46:45.010
Here,  we retrain your memory.

46:45.060 --> 46:48.800
We combine the physical  and the mental to develop  new neural pathways.

46:57.290 --> 46:59.590
Memories are held  in every organ...

47:00.420 --> 47:02.250
every cell in your body.

47:10.910 --> 47:14.830
Regression takes  the kind of concentration  it takes years to develop.

47:14.870 --> 47:16.390
This is a shortcut.

47:17.350 --> 47:20.790
We shock your mind  into synching with the system.

47:52.260 --> 47:57.480
It's working.  I'm seeing increased activity  in all his memory centers.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.340
Hey!

48:48.090 --> 48:50.880
Come on.

48:52.360 --> 48:54.840
That's not Treadway.Really?

48:54.880 --> 48:56.280
He just beat you.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.540
Treadway would've killed me.

49:05.370 --> 49:10.070
Wow. She wasn't kidding  about being at war, huh?

49:10.120 --> 49:12.730
Improving  the human condition.

49:12.770 --> 49:16.040
Sometimes you do it  by painting  a chapel ceiling.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.520
Yeah. And sometimes  you drop them  from a mile out.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.740
Don't touch that.

49:20.780 --> 49:22.390
Okay, okay.

49:25.700 --> 49:28.180
That's no gun  I've ever seen before.

49:28.220 --> 49:31.880
We're reverse-engineering  Bathurst's Dethroner.

49:31.920 --> 49:36.270
A Dethroner?  I mean, dude, who's  coming up with these names?

49:36.320 --> 49:37.580
Look...

49:39.060 --> 49:41.150
you can't kill an Infinite.  You kill the body, but...

49:41.190 --> 49:44.240
And they get reincarnated?Yeah.

49:45.240 --> 49:48.630
This implants in your head

49:48.680 --> 49:51.420
and pulls out  your consciousness...

49:52.550 --> 49:55.420
your soul,  and onto a digital chip.

49:55.470 --> 49:57.990
Your soul gets stuck on a disk  and breaks the cycle.

49:59.820 --> 50:02.950
Over 200 of our brothers  and sisters are lost

50:03.000 --> 50:05.040
in that digital purgatory.

50:05.950 --> 50:08.570
You come face to face  with this,

50:08.610 --> 50:12.920
my advice--  find a way to die  the old-fashioned way.

50:16.360 --> 50:18.010
Come in.

50:22.320 --> 50:24.060
Okay if I look around?

50:24.100 --> 50:25.930
Be my guest.

50:45.300 --> 50:47.520
These are all you,  aren't they?

50:48.480 --> 50:50.650
They're people I once was.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.390
All of them.

50:56.090 --> 50:57.480
Wow.

50:57.530 --> 51:00.050
That's cool.  You look happy.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.010
I was.

51:04.140 --> 51:05.670
Who's that guy?

51:05.710 --> 51:08.540
In that picture,  he was Abel.

51:09.450 --> 51:14.240
Before then,  other names, other faces.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.940
But the soul...

51:16.680 --> 51:18.770
the soul was always him.

51:18.810 --> 51:21.900
So, what?  You loved each other  through multiple lives?

51:22.640 --> 51:24.820
These are all  the same place.

51:24.860 --> 51:28.080
Angkor Wat.  What we call the Beginning.

51:29.950 --> 51:33.170
I'll find you in the Beginning.

51:33.220 --> 51:34.700
I love you.

51:34.740 --> 51:38.220
When each of us  would find ourselves  in a new life,

51:38.260 --> 51:39.870
this is where  Abel and I would go.

51:39.920 --> 51:42.570
You're reincarnated.  How would you know  where to go?

51:43.490 --> 51:47.360
Most of us have a reawakening  that begins young.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.970
Starts with small things,  memories,

51:50.010 --> 51:52.540
feelings about a place,  dreams.

51:53.190 --> 51:54.760
By puberty,

51:54.800 --> 51:56.850
most Infinites  have full recall.

51:56.890 --> 52:01.030
Right around  the time they diagnosed me  schizophrenic.

52:02.110 --> 52:04.510
So what happened  if you died young  and got separated?

52:04.550 --> 52:06.380
For an Infinite...

52:07.470 --> 52:09.640
death isn't the end,  it's like...

52:10.250 --> 52:12.560
turning the page in a book.

52:12.600 --> 52:15.560
Next chapter, same story.

52:16.390 --> 52:18.040
That's crazy.

52:18.090 --> 52:21.480
New lives, new bodies,  always meeting back  at the same place.

52:24.220 --> 52:25.400
He was Dethroned.

52:27.970 --> 52:30.490
He's trapped  on a computer  somewhere.

52:31.360 --> 52:35.100
My last life,  I got my memories back...

52:36.580 --> 52:38.540
and realized he was gone.

52:46.460 --> 52:48.940
It's not my memories  that matter, Evan.

52:50.600 --> 52:51.820
It's yours.

52:58.520 --> 53:01.430
Your last life,  in Mexico...

53:02.220 --> 53:04.440
where did you hide the Egg?

53:26.370 --> 53:28.160
Where's the Egg?

53:37.560 --> 53:39.650
Where is it?

53:48.920 --> 53:50.480
He's spiking.Shut it down.

53:54.400 --> 53:55.660
Hey, you're okay.

53:55.710 --> 53:58.270
You're okay. Hey.  Hey, just breathe.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.540
I need to get up.Breathe.

53:59.580 --> 54:01.100
Kovic, check his vitals.

54:01.150 --> 54:03.190
What happened in there, Evan?  What did you see?

54:03.240 --> 54:05.890
Your neural network fired off  like the Fourth of July.

54:05.930 --> 54:09.420
I've been seeing this stuff  all my life. It still  doesn't make any sense.

54:09.460 --> 54:10.810
Why can't he  remember anything?

54:10.850 --> 54:12.420
Between the car accident,  the electroshock

54:12.460 --> 54:15.770
and the steel plate in his head,  his mind is fractured.

54:15.810 --> 54:17.770
Something in there  won't let the memories flow.

54:17.810 --> 54:22.860
I can't get them out.  I'm afraid the Artisan  is our last hope.

54:29.170 --> 54:31.610
He'll achieve recall soon.

54:33.440 --> 54:35.140
If he hasn't already.

54:43.620 --> 54:45.930
Hundreds of lifetimes,

54:45.970 --> 54:48.890
and it all comes down  to these few hours.

54:50.980 --> 54:53.240
If we don't find him...

54:55.160 --> 54:58.120
before he gets  his memories back...

54:58.860 --> 55:00.640
we lose the Egg...

55:02.120 --> 55:03.250
forever.

55:05.380 --> 55:07.210
The wheels keep turning

55:07.260 --> 55:10.080
and we can never...

55:11.740 --> 55:13.650
escape.

55:17.740 --> 55:19.880
We go at dawn.

56:12.490 --> 56:14.670
It's been a while, Otto.

56:14.710 --> 56:19.850
No one's called me  by that name in...  so many lifetimes.

56:28.820 --> 56:30.820
Hello, my love.

56:32.300 --> 56:33.950
What happened to you?

56:35.430 --> 56:37.820
You were so beautiful.

56:38.650 --> 56:40.170
As were you.

56:40.610 --> 56:42.440
You don't miss it--

56:42.480 --> 56:44.180
the agility...

56:44.920 --> 56:46.180
the vibrancy...

56:47.360 --> 56:48.790
being confined to this?

56:48.840 --> 56:52.100
You see me  as something broken.  I don't.

56:53.060 --> 56:55.620
You're the cripple, Otto.

56:55.670 --> 56:57.970
Crippled by your cowardice.Cowardice?

56:58.020 --> 57:03.110
No. I'm crippled  by my memory.

57:03.150 --> 57:07.110
You get your memories back  over years. Not me.

57:07.160 --> 57:11.290
I get it all back  as my brain forms.  In the womb.

57:11.340 --> 57:16.730
Endless hours,  days, weeks, months.

57:16.780 --> 57:18.130
No room to move!

57:18.170 --> 57:20.650
Nothing  for my brain to do

57:20.690 --> 57:23.040
but eat itself.

57:23.090 --> 57:26.740
All these lifetimes,  the magnitude of this gift,

57:26.790 --> 57:29.310
and you haven't  learned a thing.

57:29.350 --> 57:30.920
I have to get out.

57:31.880 --> 57:33.450
I have to make it stop.

57:34.360 --> 57:38.190
Don't do it.  Don't give him anything.

57:39.450 --> 57:40.930
Where is Treadway?

57:47.720 --> 57:49.770
We storming the beach  at Normandy?

57:49.810 --> 57:52.070
You never know  with the Artisan.

57:52.990 --> 57:54.380
Let's get ready.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.070
Color out, please.

58:34.680 --> 58:36.860
So, the Artisan's  a gambler?

58:36.900 --> 58:38.420
No, he's a hedonist.

58:38.470 --> 58:41.820
Infinite lies,  infinite opportunity  for debauchery.

58:41.860 --> 58:43.780
Sounds like  my kinda guy.

59:37.480 --> 59:40.140
Alexa, music off.

59:40.180 --> 59:42.750
Get him cleaned up  and outta here.

59:42.790 --> 59:44.970
You're operating  on dead guys now?

59:45.010 --> 59:47.490
Da Vinci used to  cut into human cadavers

59:47.540 --> 59:50.630
so that he could  better understand  the human form.

59:50.670 --> 59:54.060
For me, I'm all about  that brain, baby.

59:54.110 --> 59:58.330
But you know that  all too well.

59:58.370 --> 01:00:03.030
Oh, what a beautiful  cranial arch you got  this time around.

01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:07.470
I could better examine it  if I severed your head  from your neck.

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:09.860
Like Treadway did to me  when last we met.

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.820
Try it.Oh.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.040
Bathurst took the Hub.

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:19.000
Does he have the Egg?No.

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.400
Think we'd be here  if he did?

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.140
Wherever it is,  it's still in his head.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.920
Treadway?

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.270
So they say.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:35.020
Wait. Is he blocked?

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:39.720
Well, well, well,  look at this.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.980
Huh.

01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:45.380
So, your hard drive  got fragged,

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.550
which means we're gonna  have to reset your memory.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.600
And, Heinrich, I gotta tell ya,  I'm really gonna enjoy this.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.080
Ooh!

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:57.740
Check this out.

01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:03.390
You're all familiar  with the idea  that when you die,

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.610
your life flashes  before your eyes, right?

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.880
This machine  enhances that experience,

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.190
prolonging  your sense of time,

01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:17.280
allowing you  to restore or reorder  everything inside.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:24.330
This-- This right here  is the closest you're gonna get  to a total mental reboot.

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.940
Are you planning  on trying to drown me?

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.330
Cause I got a thing  about drowning.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.590
Which is?I don't like it!

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.730
What kind of success rate  is this guy working with,  anyway?

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:36.250
Confidence is... high.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.080
Yeah, and so are you,  obviously.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.820
Okay. Hey.

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:43.260
I like you this time around.  You're actually funny.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:47.870
Don't take this the wrong way,  but you're usually  kind of a jerk.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.530
It's true.Yeah, she gets it.

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:51.660
So, I'm supposed  to trust this guy?

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.440
I wouldn't.First,

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:55.230
I resent  the gender labeling.

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:58.620
Second, you can trust  that we share the same goal.

01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:00.230
Really? Which is?

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.800
Bathurst wants to what,  destroy every living thing  on Earth?

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:07.630
Well, that's gonna ruin  a pretty great party  I've got goin' on here.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.720
This guy's out of his mind.  Hey--

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:13.860
There's a reason you  didn't bring me here before.Mmm.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.680
I could die in there.Yeah.

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:19.510
Could it work?

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.690
It could.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.480
But you have a choice,  Evan.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.740
No, I don't have a choice.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.870
I... I can't let  anybody else get hurt

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.750
because of what's in my head.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.500
All right.  Leap-of-faith time.

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:49.240
Let's just do it now  before I change my mind.  All right?

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.850
Let's go.  Turn your machine on.

01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:53.500
Ooh. Ready to go for a swim?

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:56.070
Yes.  This is gonna be so fun!

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.070
Just shut up and turn it on.

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:20.620
..prolongs your sense of time.

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:26.320
Whatever happens,  don't let them stop  until it's done.

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:11.490
He'll hold his breath  as long as he can, and then...

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:13.800
base instinct  takes over.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:31.730
Twenty-two.  Too many.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.560
Twenty. No more.  And 18.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.370
Oh, my God.  He's drowning.

01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:58.630
That's the whole idea.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.160
Maybe we should pull him out.He's not there yet.  Two more minutes.

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:15.170
Abel, listen to me.  If I fail...

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.130
Come on.

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:24.220
Nora...He's dying.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.310
We're close.  We are close.

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:33.230
Doesn't have a pulse!

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:35.710
Get him out!

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:42.890
Come on!  Come on.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:55.770
Okay. Okay.

01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:58.600
Get out of the way.

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.430
No!

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.710
He's gone.

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:22.930
We killed him.

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.610
If I fail, look inside.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.980
Evan, you're okay.  Just breathe.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.310
I am Treadway.  I am Treadway.

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:46.840
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:51.020
I'm Treadway.

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.940
If you are Treadway,  answer this:

01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:00.980
Do you know  where the Egg is?

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:22.660
Yes.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.570
Yes?Yes.

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.880
Look inside. Look inside.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.930
We were trained  to think of bodies  as unimportant, right?

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.540
Right.Just shells  meant to be discarded.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.410
Well, Treadway knew  the one place

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.110
that nobody would look.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.090
Abel? Abel, listen to me.

01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:00.170
If I fail, look inside.

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.390
It's in his body.

01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:04.220
Back at the Hub.

01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:09.920
It's been there  the whole time.  Come on.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.930
I am shocked that that worked.

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:22.980
I knew it was you  the whole time.  That's why I let you win.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.020
Oh, you let me, huh?

01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:25.680
Whoo! I don't know  about you guys,

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.590
but I could use a drink.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.070
Come on,  we don't have time for--

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:32.820
Security lockdown!

01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:37.210
I'm hit.

01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:38.950
You all right?

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.260
Hey!

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:46.920
Follow me.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.140
Come on. We gotta go.

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.180
Open emergency lift.

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.880
We gotta go. We gotta go.Wait!

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:57.540
Are you crazy?  They're about to breach!

01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:00.450
We're not running,  all right?  I'm tired of running.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.460
I'm gonna fight 'em right now. Hang in there, Trace.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160
She's dead.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.420
Oh, sh...

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.470
Guys, we need to leave now.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.610
I'm staying.What?

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:25.690
We stay here,  we fight 'em now.

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:32.830
You're leaking  like the Titanic.I'm fine.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.840
If you die here,  who stops Bathurst?

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.750
He's right.

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:39.620
Hey.

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:43.580
You make this worth it,  dziecko.

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:46.320
Then buy me some time.

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.720
Open weapons room door.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:52.500
Good luck.

01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:06.930
Careful, sir.

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:09.890
Oh, I will be.

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:18.740
We're taking  Treadway's body  to Scotland.

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.000
Very well.

01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:23.440
Keep him alive.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:27.010
I'll do the best I can,  but he's lost a lot of blood.

01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.970
The keys are in the car.

01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:54.990
Heinrich.

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:57.300
Good of you to join us.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.090
I only wish  you were here  to see this...

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.130
to understand your...

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.010
your role in this.

01:14:16.190 --> 01:14:18.410
The end of all our debates.

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.440
The end of all things.

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.960
Have it cleaned and tested.

01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:57.270
Make sure  it's the real thing.

01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.620
Is it really over?

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:01.580
Not quite yet.

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:04.280
Never underestimate  Treadway.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.920
Ah. You're awake.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.740
Where am I?

01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:39.440
I told Nora  I'd wait with you  until you woke up.

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:42.580
You're in my safe house.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:46.840
What are you doing?I'm doing your morphine!

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:48.190
Where is she?

01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:50.370
Huh?  Oh, she went after Bathurst.

01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:52.760
Oh, shit.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.850
She's not doing this alone.  No way.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.640
Whoa, whoa!  Come on, man.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.470
You try running out now,  you'll bleed out  before you reach the compound.

01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:07.120
If we're going down,  we're going down together.

01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:09.080
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.130
I just patched you up, man.

01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:15.090
Let me catch you up  on the current situation.

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:17.310
If Bathurst gets his way,  we're all done.

01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:19.400
There's no more  second chances.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.830
I'm gonna get the Egg  and kill him.

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.490
She told me you were one of us.

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.970
Obviously,  you're just full of shit.

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:31.930
Diagnostics are done.  The bomb is ready for the Egg.

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:33.980
Have them load it  on the plane.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.680
Come here, you bastard.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:46.990
Do you think He'll...

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.210
let us do this?

01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:53.210
No?

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:01.220
The end of all things.

01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:09.970
Go.

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:35.230
Move, move, move!On the rig! Let's go!

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:11.310
Move, move!

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.270
Dropping in three, two, one.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.110
Do you need a ride?Love one.

01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:02.110
You okay?No. Don't ask.

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:16.480
Did you see that?

01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:20.320
Nora, you okay?

01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:22.670
Okay, come on.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.720
I got you.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.590
I'll get you out of here.  Come on.

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.860
You all right?

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:39.040
Oh, shit.

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.260
Hey. We gotta get you  out of here.

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.870
You gonna be okay to move?Yeah, I'll be fine.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:52.960
Okay. Come on.

01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:35.050
You gotta go.Bathurst is getting away.

01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:38.530
His hard drives are here.  I have to destroy them  and free them all.

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.920
I'll see you again.

01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:26.900
We'll be landing in Glasgow  in 16 minutes, sir.

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.080
Stay low.

01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:32.430
Use TFR.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.130
Oh, my God.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.390
Come on. Come on.

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.270
They're all here.

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:51.750
All the souls.

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:55.150
We have to free them all.

01:25:55.190 --> 01:25:57.410
Whoa!

01:25:57.450 --> 01:25:59.320
Nora. Nora, hey. Hey.

01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:02.590
Stay with me, okay?  We are so close.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.590
Let's blow some shit up,  huh?

01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:29.220
Shit!

01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:30.790
We've lost engine three, sir.

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.630
We're gonna have to  land the aircraft.

01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:50.640
What the hell  are you doing? Sir!

01:26:57.990 --> 01:27:00.730
Please! You're gonna  crash the aircraft. Sir!

01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:09.020
It's impossible.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.110
I-Impossible.

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.250
He's opened  the bloody top hatch, sir.

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.910
You disappoint me.

01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:23.050
No recognition  whatsoever, huh?

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.220
I think I should feel hurt.

01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:30.270
Car crash?  Steel plate, remember?

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.500
Treadway,  you can't deactivate it!

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.370
It's happening!

01:32:36.330 --> 01:32:38.160
No!

01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:14.320
Death isn't the end.  Not for us.

01:33:14.370 --> 01:33:16.720
Maybe not for any of us.

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:19.200
New chapter, same story.

01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:22.420
I can carry you out.

01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:24.070
No way.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.200
I'll free them.

01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:28.510
Here.

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.910
I'll see you around.Yeah.

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:49.050
I'll find you in the Beginning.

01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:50.490
I love you.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:10.470
I ask myself...

01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:14.210
what did being Evan McCauley  teach me?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.520
If each new life  is a chance to build  on what was,

01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:26.660
a chance to press forward  to the best of what could be...

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:30.750
Go, go, go!

01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:33.710
...why will some of us  have to pick up the sword  and fight again...

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.460
...while others discover  a new beginning?

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:04.300
Nora?

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:15.360
It's hope.  That's what I learned.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:18.750
Yes, we fall.  Yes, we fail.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:21.620
Yes, sometimes we screw up  everything we touch.

01:35:21.670 --> 01:35:24.320
But each moment we live  is connected by a belief

01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:29.760
that the actions we take will  next day, next week, next life

01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:31.550
add up to something more,

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:34.160
something bigger  than yourself.

01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:54.220
And next... well,  the possibilities are...

01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:56.570
infinite.

01:37:07.770 --> 01:37:09.380
So...

01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:13.870
when your son  starts asking questions  about his past,

01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:15.170
give me a call.

01:37:23.530 --> 01:37:26.270
He says he's just a child. Ehh...

01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:27.970
What about your sword?

01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:40.150
Artisan,  what took you so long?

01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.330
See you soon, Treadway.
