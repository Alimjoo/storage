01:50.700 --> 01:51.500
解冻之后回家一看
Must have freaked you out,

01:51.510 --> 01:53.900
是不是把你吓坏了
coming home after the whole defrosting thing.

01:54.370 --> 01:55.820
是得慢慢习惯
It takes some getting used to.

01:56.230 --> 01:57.330
很高兴见到你  山姆
It's good to meet you, Sam.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.280

It's your bed, right?

我还服役的时候  躺在地上就可以睡觉
When I was over there I sleep on the ground

02:04.440 --> 02:06.800
拿石头当枕头  像原始人一样
and used rock for pillows, like a caveman.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.880
我现在回家了  躺在床上  就像
Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like...

02:09.880 --> 02:11.160

A billion and a half.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.210
要这么多
Why so steep?

03:43.360 --> 03:44.600
因为是神盾局的船
Because it S.H.I.E.L.D's.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.260
所以不是偏离航向  是非法入侵
So it's not off course, it's trespass.

03:48.260 --> 03:49.750
他们肯定有理由
I'm sure they have a good reason.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.660
我讨厌总给弗瑞擦屁股
You know, I'm getting a little tired of being Fury's janitor.

执行过三十六次暗杀任务

04:09.770 --> 04:10.510
人质呢
Hostages?

04:10.510 --> 04:14.720
大部分是技术人员  一个官员  贾斯珀·西特韦尔

04:12.690 --> 04:14.190
个人档案

04:14.720 --> 04:15.790
都在厨房
They're in the galley.

What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

04:17.630 --> 04:19.480
好了  我扫荡甲板  然后找巴托克
Alright, I'm gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.630
娜塔莎  你关掉引擎等待命令

朗姆洛  你负责船尾的人  找出人质
Rumlow, you sweep aft,find the hostages,

04:24.310 --> 04:26.130
带他们上救生艇  救出他们  出发

04:43.750 --> 04:45.500
周六晚上找乐子了吗
You do anything fun Saturday night?

04:45.500 --> 04:49.040
以前跟我一起组队的家伙都死光了
Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead,

04:49.040 --> 04:50.820
所以  没找成
so...no, not really.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.550
队长  马上进入跳伞区域
Coming up by the drop zone, Cap.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.440
你约统计部的克里斯汀试试
You know, if you ask Kristen out, from Statistics,

04:55.440 --> 04:56.930
她很可能同意呢
she'll probably say yes.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.460
所以我才不约
That's why I don't ask.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.110
太害羞还是太害怕
Too shy or too scared?

05:02.340 --> 05:03.210
是太忙
Too busy!

05:05.300 --> 05:06.600
他戴降落伞了吗

05:06.990 --> 05:09.810
没有  没戴

Yeah. You seemed pretty helpless without me.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.590
住你对门的护士怎么样
What about the nurse that lives across the hall from you?

07:18.590 --> 07:19.700
她长得挺漂亮的
She seems kind of nice.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.620
先搞定引擎室  再说约会的事
Secure the engine room, then find me a date.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.050
我能一心多用
I'm multitasking.

07:24.460 --> 07:27.490
我跟巴托克说了  想要神盾局付钱
I said to Batroc, if we want SHIELD to pay,

07:27.590 --> 07:29.470
就得杀几个人给他们看
we have to start sending bodies now!

07:31.630 --> 07:33.790
我就准备杀一个
I have a bullet for someone.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.010

07:50.770 --> 07:51.740

我可等够了

08:43.990 --> 08:46.430
找巴托克

08:46.430 --> 08:48.710
两分钟内不回话  我就开始杀人了
If I do not hear in two minutes, I'll start to kill them!

08:48.710 --> 08:50.280
好  我去找他

娜塔莎  汇报情况
Status, Natasha?

等等
Hang on!

10:04.240 --> 10:05.520
引擎室搞定
Engine room secure.

10:14.150 --> 10:17.860
时间到了  谁想先死
Time's up. Who wants to die first?

10:18.560 --> 10:21.450
你  抓那个女的
Hey, you! Take the girl.

10:24.340 --> 10:25.190
听我命令
On my mark.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.030
三  二  一
Three. Two. One.

10:35.820 --> 10:38.530
我说过  神盾局从不谈判
I told you, S.H.I.E.L.D doesn't negotiate.

10:39.350 --> 10:41.930
喂  巴托克
Hello? Batroc,

10:42.530 --> 10:45.470
那边没回应  联系不上
the line is dead. I lost contact with them.

10:46.700 --> 10:47.490
小心
Look out!

10:59.240 --> 11:01.130
人质正在撤退
Hostages enroute to extraction.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.480
罗曼诺夫没有来碰头  队长
Romanoff missed the rendezvous point, Captain.

11:05.110 --> 11:07.080
敌方仍在反抗
Hostiles are still in play.

11:07.390 --> 11:09.560
娜塔莎  巴托克逃了
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.030
绕到朗姆洛后面去保护人质
Circle back to Rumlow and protect the hostages.

11:12.860 --> 11:13.660
娜塔莎
Natasha!

11:50.390 --> 11:52.250
你不是徒有其表吧
I thought that you were more than just a shield.

12:06.270 --> 12:07.140
来试试看
Let's find out.

12:33.780 --> 12:34.940
真尴尬
Well, this is awkward.

12:38.580 --> 12:39.350
你干什么
What are you doing?

12:40.020 --> 12:41.070
备份硬盘数据
Backing up the hard drive.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.590
这是个好习惯
It's a good habit to get into.

12:43.350 --> 12:44.210
朗姆洛需要你帮忙
Rumlow needed your help.

12:44.210 --> 12:45.460
你在这干什么呢
What the hell are you doing here?

12:49.260 --> 12:50.650
你在挽救神盾局情报
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D intel.

12:50.650 --> 12:51.920
尽可能多地救下来
Whatever I can get my hands on.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.560
我们的任务是救人质
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.490
那是你的任务
No. That's your mission.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.910
你完成的很出色
And you've done it beautifully.

12:59.410 --> 13:01.260
你威胁到整个行动了
You just jeopardized this whole operation.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.000
你太夸张了吧
I think that's overstating things.

13:20.710 --> 13:23.480
好吧  这次怪我
Okay. That one's on me.

13:24.550 --> 13:25.510
就是怪你
You damn right.

13:41.340 --> 13:46.590
神盾局总部
纬度  38N 53' 33.78"  经度  77S 3' 38.91"

13:55.250 --> 13:57.190
你就只会满嘴谎话  是不是
You just can't stop yourself from lying, can you?

13:57.200 --> 14:00.050
我没说谎  罗曼诺夫特工的任务和你不同
I didn't lie. Agent Romanoff had a different mission than yours.

14:00.050 --> 14:01.820
你就没有义务跟我分享信息吗
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

14:01.820 --> 14:03.610
我没有义务做任何事
I'm not obliged to do anything.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.160
人质可能全部丧命的  尼克
Those hostages could've died, Nick.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.170
所以我派了有史以来最棒的士兵
I sent the greatest soldier in history

14:07.170 --> 14:08.750
去救他们的命
to make sure that didn't happen.

14:08.750 --> 14:11.300
士兵需要相互信任  军队靠的也是信任
Soldiers trust each other, that's what makes it an army.

14:11.300 --> 14:12.880
而不是放大伙乱开枪
Not a bunch of guys running around and shooting guns.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.640
上次我信任了别人
The last time I trusted someone,

14:14.640 --> 14:16.250
丢了只眼睛
I lost an eye.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.630
我不想给你分配你不想做的任务
Look, I didn't want you doing anything you weren't comfortable with.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.990
罗曼诺夫特工没有不想做的事
Agent Romanoff is comfortable with everything.

14:22.990 --> 14:24.470
手下的人各行其是
I can't lead a mission

14:24.470 --> 14:26.400
你叫我怎么带队执行任务
when the people I'm leading have missions of their owns.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.820
那叫各司其职
It's called compartmentalization.

14:29.210 --> 14:32.440
没人泄露秘密  因为大家都只知道一部分
Nobody spills the secrets because nobody knows them all.

14:32.760 --> 14:33.860
除了你
Except you.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.050
你看错我了
You're wrong about me.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.080
我会分享的
I do share.

14:42.460 --> 14:43.830
因为我是大好人
I'm nice like that.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.020
洞察计划舰湾
Insight bay.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.630
罗杰斯队长没有进入洞察计划的权限
Captain Rogers does not have clearance for Project Insight.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.450

Director override, Fury, Nicholas J.

14:52.660 --> 14:53.940

14:56.590 --> 14:58.340
以前电梯还放音乐的
You know, they used to play music.

14:59.090 --> 14:59.930
是啊
Yeah.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.480
我爷爷当了40年电梯操作员

15:03.950 --> 15:06.560
他工作的大楼挺不错
My granddad worked in a nice building,

15:06.570 --> 15:07.740
小费拿的不少
he got good tips.

15:08.190 --> 15:09.630
他晚上回家
He'd walk home every night,

15:09.630 --> 15:12.370
午餐袋里能有一大卷一块钱
roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.880
他跟人问好  别人也回应
He'd say "hi", people would say hi back.

15:16.680 --> 15:20.760
后来  世风日下
Time went on, neighborhood got rougher.

15:20.810 --> 15:22.410
他再问好  别人都说  少废话
He'd say "Hi", they'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

15:22.990 --> 15:25.690
他得时刻小心自己的午餐袋
Granddad got to grippin' that lunch bag a little tighter.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.320
他被抢过吗
Did he ever get mugged?

15:29.080 --> 15:31.690
每周都有小混混问他  袋子里有啥
Every week some punk would say, "What's in the bag?"

15:32.210 --> 15:32.980
他怎么办呢
Well, what did he do?

15:34.050 --> 15:34.850
给他们看看吧
He'd show 'em.

15:35.900 --> 15:39.480
一堆破旧的一块钱  还有把上膛的点22马格南
A bunch of crumpled ones and loaded 0.22 Magnum.

15:43.300 --> 15:48.240
我爷爷喜欢别人  只是不太相信别人
Granddad loved people. But he didn't trust them very much.

15:54.170 --> 15:58.270
是啊  是比马格南大了点
Yeah, I know. They're a little bit bigger than a 0.22.

16:32.510 --> 16:36.460
这是洞察计划
This is Project Insight.

16:36.460 --> 16:40.420
超前三代的直升航母  与定位卫星连线
Three next generation helicarriers synced to a network of targeting satellites.

16:40.420 --> 16:42.050

Launched from the Lemurian Star.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.050
一旦上了天  就不用降落了
Once we get them in the air they never need to come down.

16:45.630 --> 16:50.630
新的引擎可以持续做亚轨道飞行
Continuous suborbital flight courtesy of our new repulser engines.

16:50.700 --> 16:51.580
斯塔克设计的吗
Stark?

16:51.730 --> 16:53.270
他看了旧的涡轮增压引擎
Well, he had a few suggestions

16:53.270 --> 16:56.100
就给我们提了点建议
once he got an up close look at our old turbines.

16:56.590 --> 16:58.760
这些远距离精准定位武器
These new long range precision guns

16:58.760 --> 17:01.280
一分钟能消灭一千敌人
can eliminate a thousand hostiles a minute.

17:01.510 --> 17:03.540
恐怖分子不需要露面
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA

17:03.540 --> 17:05.660
卫星就能读取他的DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.230
我们能把许多威胁扼杀在摇篮里
We gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.

17:09.410 --> 17:11.420
做了坏事的人才该受到惩罚吧
I thought the punishment usually came after the crime.

17:11.550 --> 17:13.090
我们不能等到别人做了坏事
We can't afford to wait that long.

17:13.170 --> 17:13.980
我们是谁
Who's "we"?

17:14.870 --> 17:17.200
纽约的事之后  我说服了世界安全理事会
After New York, I convinced the World Security Council

17:17.200 --> 17:19.960
我们需要量子级的精密威胁分析
we needed a quantum surgeon threat analysis.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.730
这次我们远远地走在前面
For once we're way ahead of the curve.

17:23.380 --> 17:26.020
拿枪指着所有人  你管这个叫保护吗
By holding a gun at everyone on Earth and calling it protection.

17:27.850 --> 17:29.810
我读过战略科学军团的文件
You know, I read those SSR files.

17:30.710 --> 17:34.220
最伟大的一代吗  你们可干过见不得人的事
Greatest generation? You guys did some nasty stuff.

17:34.370 --> 17:36.450
是啊  我们妥协了
Yeah, we compromised.

17:36.450 --> 17:38.740
有时会因为这个夜不能寐
Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well.

17:38.740 --> 17:40.940
但我们是为了人民的自由
But we did it so the people could be free.

17:41.220 --> 17:43.410
但这不叫自由  这是恐惧
This isn't freedom, this is fear.

17:43.410 --> 17:47.020
神盾局接受现在的世界  而不是按自己的意愿改变世界
S.H.I.E.L.D takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be.

17:47.180 --> 17:48.330
你现在着手那个计划
It's getting damn near pasttime

17:48.330 --> 17:50.750
有点太晚了吧  队长
for you to get with that program, Cap.

17:52.270 --> 17:53.320
所以别抱太大希望
Don't hold your breath.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.270

巴恩斯是咆哮突击队中
Barnes is the only Howling Commando

19:36.460 --> 19:40.050
唯一一位为国捐躯的战士
to give his life in service of his country.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.120
那年冬天格外严酷
That was a difficult winter.

19:47.370 --> 19:51.080
佩姬·卡特特工  战略科学军团  纽约  1953年

19:47.560 --> 19:51.070
一场暴风雪将半个营困在了德国境内
A blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the German line.

19:51.770 --> 19:54.370
史蒂夫  罗杰斯队长
Steve... Captain Rogers,

19:54.920 --> 19:57.580
他成功穿越九头蛇对美军的封锁
he fought his way through a Hydra blockade

19:57.650 --> 20:00.360
突破了进去
that had pinned our allies down for months.

20:02.350 --> 20:04.060
他救了一千多人
He saved over a thousand men,

20:04.890 --> 20:06.940
包括后来
including the man who would...

20:07.810 --> 20:10.450
后来成为我丈夫的这位
who would become my husband as it turned out.

20:11.590 --> 20:14.560
甚至在他死后  史蒂夫也在改变着我的生活
Even after he died, Steve was still changing my life.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.270
你应该为自己骄傲  佩姬
You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.070

20:38.080 --> 20:39.180
怎么了
What is it?

20:41.700 --> 20:44.730
一直以来  我的原则是只做正确的事
For as long as I can remember I just wanted to do what was right.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.510
现在这个原则也动摇了
I guess I'm not quite sure what that is anymore.

20:51.630 --> 20:54.910
我以为自己可以随时回军队
And I thought I could throw myself back in

20:55.030 --> 20:56.920
遵守命令  保家卫国
and follow orders, serve.

21:00.710 --> 21:01.860
可是已经不一样了
It's just not the same.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.650
你老是这么夸张
You're always so dramatic.

21:08.120 --> 21:11.560
是你拯救了世界
Look, you saved the world.

21:14.050 --> 21:18.050
而我们  又给弄得一团糟
We rather...mucked it up.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.180
哪有
You didn't.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.760
我留下来  一半是因为听说你参与创办了神盾局
Knowing that you helped found S.H.I.E.L.D is half the reason I stay.

21:28.640 --> 21:33.310
世界已经变了  我们回不去了

21:34.050 --> 21:36.080

You're alive! You... you came, you came back.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.880
是啊  佩姬
Yeah, Peggy.

22:09.220 --> 22:11.650
好久不见了
It's been so long.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.300
好久了
So long.

22:16.580 --> 22:18.410
我怎么能离开我的美人
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

22:19.230 --> 22:21.010
她还欠我一支舞呢
Not when she owes me a dance.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.550
封闭办公室
Secure office.

22:36.510 --> 22:39.360
打开雷姆利亚星号卫星发射文件
Open Lemurian Star satellite launch file.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.900
拒绝访问
Access denied.

22:43.150 --> 22:44.200

22:56.460 --> 22:57.690
谁的的命令
On whose authority?

22:58.020 --> 22:59.990
尼古拉斯·J·弗瑞
Fury, Nicholas J.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.240

World Security Council.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.120
确认
Confirmed.

23:11.050 --> 23:13.500
如果尼克·弗瑞觉得他的面具男
If Nick Fury thinks he can get us costumed thugs

23:13.500 --> 23:15.670
和突击队能处理他惹的麻烦
and S.T.R.I.K.E commandos to mop-up his mess,

23:15.670 --> 23:18.300
真是大错特错  这个错误不能容忍
he's sadly mistaken. This failure is unacceptable.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.520
鉴于袭击就发生在
Well, considering this attack took place one mile

23:20.520 --> 23:22.110
我国海域一英里外
from my country's sovereign waters,

23:22.120 --> 23:24.840
恐怕这样还不够  我要开听证会
it's a bit more then that. I move for immediate hearing.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.020
我们不需要听证会  需要行动
We don't need hearings, we need action.

23:26.220 --> 23:29.280
理事会的责任是监管神盾局
It's this Council's duty to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.370
这次的问题引出了许多疑问
A breach like this raises serious questions.

23:31.370 --> 23:33.150
比如一个法国海盗
Like how the hell did a French pirate

23:33.160 --> 23:37.240
怎么能光天化日劫持了神盾局的机密军舰
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D vessel in broad daylight?

23:37.240 --> 23:38.420
申明一下  理事
For the record, councilman,

23:38.420 --> 23:39.490
他是阿尔及利亚人
he's Algerian.

23:40.150 --> 23:41.500
需要的话可以画张地图
I can draw a map if it'll help.

23:42.090 --> 23:45.030
感谢你的智慧  皮尔斯部长
I appreciate your wits, Secretary Pierce.

23:45.610 --> 23:46.870
但是理事会
But this council take things

23:46.870 --> 23:49.230
对国际海盗的事是很认真的
like international piracy fairly seriously.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.450
是吗  我倒不在乎
Really? I don't.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.070
我不在乎一船一舰
I don't care about one boat,

23:55.070 --> 23:56.150
我在乎整个舰队
I care about the fleet.

23:57.430 --> 24:00.720
如果理事会遇到点小事
If this council is going to fold a rancor every time

24:00.720 --> 24:03.100
就要把我数落一顿
someone pushes us on the playing field,

24:04.140 --> 24:06.000
是不是也要有人监管我们了
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.550
部长先生  我们不是说...
Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...

24:13.060 --> 24:13.920
失陪一下
Excuse me.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.600
又有麻烦了吗  部长先生
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?

24:15.830 --> 24:17.260
取决于你怎么定义麻烦
It depends on your definition.

24:26.430 --> 24:27.820
我们办公室只隔了四十层
I work forty floors away

24:27.820 --> 24:29.540
没人劫船你都不肯来吗
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

24:29.540 --> 24:31.470
核战爆发我也会来的
Well, a nuclear war would do it too.

24:32.950 --> 24:33.950
忙吗
Busy in there?

24:34.240 --> 24:36.240
用钱都能解决
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.410
我是来找你帮忙的
I'm here to ask a favor.

24:41.890 --> 24:43.820
我希望你能组织一次投票
I want you to call for a vote.

24:43.820 --> 24:46.100
洞察计划需要延后
Project Insight has to be delayed.

24:46.660 --> 24:48.880
尼克  你这不是找我帮忙
Nick, that's not a favor,

24:48.880 --> 24:50.520
这需要小组委员会开好长的听证会
that's a subcommittee hearing. A long one.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.630
也许是没什么问题
It could be nothing, probably is nothing.

24:52.650 --> 24:55.370
可我得确保万无一失
I just need time to make sure it's nothing.

24:55.370 --> 24:56.360
如果有问题呢
What if it's something?

24:56.360 --> 24:57.660
那我们都该庆幸
Then we'll both be damn glad

24:57.660 --> 24:59.430
没把直升航母送上天
those Helicarriers aren't in the air.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.660
好吧
Fine.

25:03.190 --> 25:06.510
但你得让钢铁侠参加我侄女的生日派对
But you gotta get Iron Man to stop by my niece's birthday party.

25:07.210 --> 25:08.060
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

25:08.810 --> 25:11.270
不是路过  得好好玩会儿
And not just a fly-by, he's got to mingle.

25:14.650 --> 25:17.340
问题是我觉得情况在恶化
The thing is I think it's getting worse.

25:19.630 --> 25:21.320
上周一个警察让我停在路边
A cop pulled me over last week,

25:21.700 --> 25:22.730
他以为我喝醉了
he thought I was drunk.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.660
我急转弯  想躲一个塑料袋
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.620
我以为那是简易炸弹
I thought it was an IED.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.570
有些东西留在了那边
Some stuff you leave there,

25:35.300 --> 25:37.000
有些东西需要带回来
other stuff you bring back.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.310
怎么带回来是我们自己的事
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

25:40.590 --> 25:42.410
是装在箱子里
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase

25:43.210 --> 25:44.710
还是放在钱包里
or in a little man-purse?

25:45.980 --> 25:46.960
取决于你自己
It's up to you.

25:48.260 --> 25:49.000
下周见
I'll see you next week.

25:51.610 --> 25:54.040
这不是跑步小能手吗
Look who it is. The running man.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.290
听到了最后几分钟  讲得真好
Caught the last few minutes. It's pretty intense.

25:57.380 --> 25:58.180
是啊
Yeah, brother,

25:58.520 --> 26:00.490
我们都有一样的问题
we all got the same problems.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.610
愧疚  悔恨
Guilt, regret.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.500
你失去了亲近的人吗
You lose someone?

26:06.670 --> 26:11.380
我的僚机莱利  夜间飞行任务
My wingman, Riley. Fly in the night mission.

26:11.380 --> 26:13.710

我父亲以前在101空降师  进来吧

41:59.370 --> 42:01.310
警卫帮我逃了出来
and security got me out,

42:02.260 --> 42:03.830

42:04.090 --> 42:07.340
尼克是神盾局在当地的负责人

结果是  叛军不跟我们谈判
Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate,

42:16.640 --> 42:18.280
于是下令格杀勿论
so they put out a kill order.

42:18.540 --> 42:20.180
他们扫荡了地下室
They stormed the basement,

42:20.570 --> 42:22.270

42:23.870 --> 42:25.620
尼克没有听从我的直接命令
Nick had ignored my direct order

42:25.620 --> 42:27.590

42:35.260 --> 42:37.230

42:45.350 --> 42:46.270

Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

43:14.930 --> 43:17.120
不是他  比这要复杂得多
No, it's more complicated than that.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.160
巴托克受一位匿名人士雇佣
Batroc was hired anonymously

43:19.160 --> 43:20.560

43:20.630 --> 43:22.070
他们通过电子邮件联系

43:33.810 --> 43:35.070
我应该认识他吗
Am I supposed to know who that is?

43:41.080 --> 43:42.150
我第一次见尼克时
When I first met Nick

43:42.150 --> 43:44.150
得知他母亲住在14-37号
his mother lived at 14-37.

43:46.050 --> 43:48.580
你的意思是弗瑞雇了海盗吗
Are you saying Fury hired the pirates?

43:48.580 --> 43:49.600
为什么呢
Why?

43:49.720 --> 43:51.160
比较盛行的说法是
Well the prevailing theory

43:52.570 --> 43:57.740
这种劫持不过是为了掩饰
was that the hijacking was a cover

43:57.740 --> 43:58.600
机密情报的交易
for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence.

43:59.810 --> 44:02.600
交易出了岔  结果尼克送了命
The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.

44:05.730 --> 44:07.060
如果你真了解尼克·弗瑞
If you really knew Nick Fury

44:07.060 --> 44:08.280
就该知道这不可能
you know that's not true.

44:09.770 --> 44:11.130
不然你为什么会来见我
Why do you think we're talking?

44:15.450 --> 44:16.860
你知道吗  我在理事会工作
See, I took a seat on the Council

44:16.860 --> 44:19.750
不是我愿意  而是尼克请求的
not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to,

44:19.840 --> 44:21.920
因为我们都十分现实
because we were both realists.

44:23.430 --> 44:25.750
我们知道  除去那些
We knew that despite all the diplomacy

44:25.750 --> 44:27.620
外交手腕和虚情假意
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

44:28.580 --> 44:30.700
想建立更美好的新世界
that to build a really better world

44:31.660 --> 44:34.250
有时需要摧毁旧的世界
sometimes means having to tear the old one down.

44:37.180 --> 44:38.420
而这样难免树敌
And that makes enemies.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.610
他们会说你无耻肮脏
Those people that call you dirty

44:42.610 --> 44:45.180
因为你不惜做见不得人的事
because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud

44:45.180 --> 44:46.520
只为创造更美好的事物
and try to build something better.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.750
一想到那些人现在过得悠然自在
And the idea that those people could be happy today,

44:52.220 --> 44:54.450
就让我非常恼火
makes me really, really angry.

44:58.840 --> 45:01.000
队长  你是尼克生前见到的最后一人
Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.360
我认为这绝非巧合
I don't think that's an accident,

45:03.500 --> 45:05.100
我想你也这样觉得
and I don't think you do either.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.790
所以我再问你一次
So I'm gonna ask again,

45:08.790 --> 45:10.750
他为什么会在你那
why was he there?

45:14.320 --> 45:15.890
他告诉我不要相信任何人
He told me not to trust anyone.

45:18.650 --> 45:20.820
也包括他吗
I wonder if that included him.

45:25.900 --> 45:28.690
抱歉  那是他的遗言
I'm sorry. Those were his last words.

45:30.320 --> 45:31.180
失陪
Excuse me.

45:34.860 --> 45:35.630
队长
Captain.

45:36.340 --> 45:39.220
有人杀害了我的朋友  我必须查明根源
Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why.

45:40.570 --> 45:44.010
挡我路的  我都会让他后悔
Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it.

45:44.010 --> 45:45.150
无论是谁
Anyone.

45:48.710 --> 45:49.610
明白
Understood.

46:07.520 --> 46:08.990
操作控制中心
Operations control.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.340

46:12.090 --> 46:14.190

46:19.250 --> 46:20.240
朗姆洛

物证组在楼顶上发现了些纤维
Evidence response found some fibers

46:31.040 --> 46:32.460
想让我们去看看
on the roof they want us to see.

46:32.470 --> 46:34.090
要战术小队就位吗
You want me to get the tac-team ready?

46:34.150 --> 46:36.170
先看看情况再说
No, lets wait and see what it is first.

46:36.220 --> 46:37.290
好的
Right.

46:48.750 --> 46:50.300
现在什么情况
What's the status so far?

46:51.450 --> 46:52.770

46:53.780 --> 46:54.930

弗瑞的事  我深表遗憾
Sorry about what happened with Fury.

47:06.140 --> 47:07.770
真是惨剧
Messed up what happened to him.

47:08.260 --> 47:09.140
谢谢

47:46.650 --> 47:48.470
动手之前
Before we get started,

47:49.370 --> 47:51.040
还有人想出去吗
does anyone want to get out?

47:57.180 --> 47:57.640
<i><b>紧急停止</b></i>

48:25.400 --> 48:27.660
派遣突击队至25楼
Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E units, 25th floor.

48:42.310 --> 48:43.690

Woh, big guy.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.240
这不是私人恩怨  队长
I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal.

48:59.320 --> 49:01.060
我感觉就是私人恩怨
It kind of feels personal.

49:09.460 --> 49:11.440
放下盾牌  举起双手
25th Floor Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air!

49:27.940 --> 49:28.950
投降吧  罗杰斯
Give it up, Rogers!

49:28.950 --> 49:30.410
把门打开
Get that door open!

49:30.970 --> 49:32.510
你无路可逃了
You have nowhere to go!

49:52.200 --> 49:53.320
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

49:53.320 --> 49:56.280
他往车库去了  封闭大桥
He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge!

50:07.130 --> 50:10.540
罗杰斯队长  立刻投降
Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down.

50:10.680 --> 50:13.050
重复  立刻投降
Repeat, stand down.

50:49.090 --> 50:50.280
都听好了
Eyes here.

50:51.090 --> 50:52.860
无论手头上有什么事  都推掉
Whatever your op is, bury it.

50:52.860 --> 50:54.580
现在是一级戒备
This is level one.

50:54.850 --> 50:58.710
通知交通部  特区的路口全部亮红灯
Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red.

50:58.710 --> 51:02.930
封锁附近机场所有跑道
Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan.

51:02.930 --> 51:04.630
将市区里的所有监控录像

51:04.630 --> 51:06.450
调到这个显示屏上
go through this monitor, right here.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.770
追踪所有通讯设备
Scan all open sources.

51:08.770 --> 51:12.170
电话  电脑  平板  能查的都查
Phones, computers, PDA's, whatever.

51:12.590 --> 51:15.530
有人发微博我也要立刻知道
If someone Tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.

51:15.670 --> 51:16.460
恕我直言
With all due respect,

51:16.460 --> 51:18.560
如果神盾局要追捕美国队长
If S.H.I.E.L.D is conducting a manhunt for Captain America,

51:18.560 --> 51:19.790
我们有权知道原因
we deserve to know why.

51:20.580 --> 51:22.490
因为他骗了我们
Because he lied to us.

51:23.540 --> 51:24.340
罗杰斯队长
Captain Rogers

51:24.340 --> 51:27.620
知道弗瑞局长的死因
has information regarding the death of Director Fury,

51:27.890 --> 51:29.460
却不愿告诉我们
he refused to share it.

51:30.710 --> 51:33.320
我知道大家很难接受
As difficult as this is to accept,

51:33.830 --> 51:36.950
但美国队长现在是神盾局的在逃犯
Captain America is a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.

52:04.820 --> 52:05.830
-哪去了  -安全的地方
- Where is it? - Safe.

52:05.840 --> 52:06.570
说重点
Do better!

52:06.570 --> 52:07.600
你哪里弄来的
Where did you get it?

52:07.610 --> 52:08.870
凭什么告诉你
Why would I tell you?

52:09.100 --> 52:11.080
弗瑞为什么要给你
Fury gave it to you. Why?

52:11.120 --> 52:11.930
里面是什么
What's on it?

52:11.980 --> 52:12.770
我不知道
I don't know.

52:12.770 --> 52:13.870
别说谎
Stop lying!

52:13.870 --> 52:16.520
我只是看上去什么都懂  罗杰斯
I only act like I know everything, Rogers.

52:17.160 --> 52:19.300
你一定知道是弗瑞雇佣的海盗
I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?

52:20.080 --> 52:20.690
一切就说得通了
Well, it makes sense.

52:20.690 --> 52:23.130
那艘船有问题  你和弗瑞都要想办法上去
The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

52:23.130 --> 52:24.880
别让我再问你第二遍
I'm not gonna ask you again.

52:26.290 --> 52:27.800
我知道谁杀了弗瑞
I know who killed Fury.

52:31.450 --> 52:33.960
多数情报机构不相信他的存在
Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists,

52:33.960 --> 52:36.810
相信的称他为寒冬战士
the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier.

52:37.040 --> 52:39.220
在过去的五十年里  他参与了二十多起
He's credited with over two dozen assassinations

52:39.220 --> 52:41.510
暗杀事件
in the last fifty years.

52:41.510 --> 52:43.130
所以说他像个鬼魂一样
So he's a ghost story.

52:43.340 --> 52:46.740
五年前  我护送一个核武器工程师离开伊朗
Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran,

52:46.740 --> 52:49.520
快到敖德萨时  有人射穿了我的轮胎
somebody shot at my tires near Odessa.

52:49.530 --> 52:53.020
车失控掉下悬崖  我们逃了出来
We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out,

52:53.230 --> 52:55.170
寒冬战士也在那里
but the Winter Soldier was there.

52:55.950 --> 52:59.940
见我挡着  他就一枪打穿了这里杀死了工程师
I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me.

53:00.770 --> 53:05.550
苏联子弹  没有膛线  穿不了比基尼了
A Soviet slag, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.

53:06.190 --> 53:08.370
你现在穿比基尼一定很丑
Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now.

53:10.780 --> 53:13.720
追踪他是不现实的  我试过
Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried.

53:14.540 --> 53:16.680
像你说的  他就是个鬼魂
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

53:21.650 --> 53:23.570
那就看看那个鬼魂到底想要什么
Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.

53:23.570 --> 53:26.140
尼克·弗瑞被残忍地谋杀了
Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.

53:26.370 --> 53:27.800
但凡是个正常人
To any reasonable person,

53:27.800 --> 53:30.600
都会说他是烈士  而非叛徒
that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.

53:30.600 --> 53:32.180
可他为什么是叛徒
You know what makes him a traitor?

53:32.180 --> 53:34.860
他让雇佣兵劫持自己的船
Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.

53:34.860 --> 53:37.110
尼克·弗瑞利用与你的交情
Nick Fury used your friendship

53:37.110 --> 53:40.230
强迫理事会延迟洞察计划
to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight.

53:40.230 --> 53:43.040
他知道这个计划会暴露他的非法行动
A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.940
说好听点  他骗了你  说句不好听的
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

53:45.940 --> 53:48.160
你们想让我引咎辞职吗
Are you calling for my resignation?

53:48.400 --> 53:49.910
我现在就可以写辞呈
I've got a pen and paper right here.

53:49.910 --> 53:52.880
这个我们可以迟点讨论
That discussion can be tabled for a later time.

53:53.980 --> 53:55.510
你们还真想让我辞职
But you do want to have a discussion.

53:55.510 --> 53:57.770
我们已经谈过了  部长先生
We've already had it, Mr. Secretary.

53:58.550 --> 54:03.220
理事会决定立即重启洞察计划
This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight.

54:04.190 --> 54:07.870
你要是想耍嘴皮子  赶紧趁现在
If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.

54:13.760 --> 54:17.160
逃亡第一准则  只能走不能跑
First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.

54:17.800 --> 54:20.290
如果穿着这双鞋跑  早就掉下来了
If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off.

54:23.040 --> 54:24.800
这个驱动器拥有六级定位系统
The drive has a level six homing program,

54:24.800 --> 54:27.680
一旦我们启动  神盾局就能定位我们
so as soon as we boot up S.H.I.E.L.D will know exactly where we are.

54:27.990 --> 54:28.970
需要多长时间
How much time do we have?

54:28.970 --> 54:32.140
九分钟吧  现在
About nine minutes from...

54:33.030 --> 54:33.870
开始
Now.

54:39.170 --> 54:41.100
弗瑞的猜测是对的
Fury was right about that ship,

54:41.100 --> 54:43.040
有人想在那艘船上藏东西
somebody's trying to hide something.

54:42.920 --> 54:45.300
雷姆利亚星号

54:43.320 --> 54:45.600
这个驱动器被某种人工智能保护着
This drive is protected by some sort of AI,

54:45.600 --> 54:48.180
一直在重组自己  抵抗我的指令
it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.

54:48.180 --> 54:49.410
你能破解吗
Can you override it?

54:50.560 --> 54:53.230
开发这个程序的人比我聪明点
The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me.

54:53.570 --> 54:54.610
就那么一点
Slightly.

55:05.190 --> 55:07.090
我要试试追踪程序
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.120
这是神盾局用来
This is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D

55:09.120 --> 55:10.840
追踪恶意软件的程序
developed to track hostile malware,

55:10.840 --> 55:13.950
就算我们读不到文件
so if we can't read the file,

55:13.950 --> 55:16.100
也许可以查到它的来源
maybe we can find out where it came from.

55:16.100 --> 55:17.720
有什么可以帮到你们的吗
Can I help you guys with anything?

55:17.900 --> 55:18.630
没事
Oh, no.

55:18.630 --> 55:21.610

My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.

55:21.610 --> 55:23.690

55:57.010 --> 55:57.930

I used to. Let's go.

56:01.900 --> 56:03.170
标准战术小队
Standard tac-team.

56:03.170 --> 56:06.370
两前两后  侧翼还有两个
Two behind, two across, two coming straight at us.

如果被发现了  我跟他们打
If they make us, I'll engage,

56:07.830 --> 56:09.440
你搭南边的电梯去地铁站
you hit the south escalator to the metro.

56:09.440 --> 56:11.410
闭嘴  搂着我  笑两声
Shut up and put your arm around me, laugh at something I said.

56:11.410 --> 56:12.760

吻我
Kiss me.

56:37.510 --> 56:38.180
什么
What?

56:38.180 --> 56:40.410
公共场合秀恩爱  让人很不自在
Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.

56:40.410 --> 56:41.250

56:50.790 --> 56:52.410
还不自在吗
You still uncomfortable?

56:53.350 --> 56:55.290
也不能这么说
It's not exactly the word I would use.

56:55.140 --> 56:56.720
欢迎来到新泽西

Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?

57:07.350 --> 57:08.330

Nazi Germany.

57:09.160 --> 57:11.770
还有这车是借来的  脚别放在仪表盘上
And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash.

57:15.180 --> 57:17.070
好吧  我有个问题
Alright, I have a question for you,

57:17.070 --> 57:18.810
你可以不回答
of which you do not have to answer.

57:19.240 --> 57:20.350
不过我觉得即使你不回答
I feel like if you don't answer it though,

57:20.350 --> 57:21.530
也算是回答了
you're kind of answering it, you know?

57:21.540 --> 57:22.160
什么问题
What?

57:22.160 --> 57:24.930
这是你自1945年以后的第一次接吻吗
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

57:25.100 --> 57:26.010
有那么糟吗
That bad, huh?

57:26.010 --> 57:26.750
我可没这么说
I didn't say that.

57:26.750 --> 57:28.540
听起来就是那个意思
Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.

57:28.540 --> 57:31.520
不是  我只是好奇你练习过几次
No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you had.

57:31.530 --> 57:33.640
-我不需要练习  -每个人都需要
- I don't need practice. - Everybody needs practice.

57:33.640 --> 57:36.140
这不是我自1945年之后的第一次接吻
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

57:36.370 --> 57:38.190

I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.

57:38.420 --> 57:39.930
没遇到过特别的人吗
Nobody special, though?

57:42.320 --> 57:42.820
不管你信不信
Believe it or not,

57:42.820 --> 57:45.770
要找个和我有类似人生经历的人不太容易
it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.

57:45.770 --> 57:47.680
管他的  你随便编个故事就好了
Well, that's alright, you just make something up.

57:47.680 --> 57:48.920
像你一样吗
What, like you?

57:49.330 --> 57:51.200
我不知道  说实话也要看情况
I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances,

57:51.200 --> 57:54.040
不能对谁都掏心窝
it's not all things to all people all the time.

57:54.990 --> 57:56.270
我也是
And neither am I.

57:56.730 --> 57:58.200
这样活着很累
That's a tough way to live.

57:59.140 --> 58:00.960
但能保命
It's a good way not to die, though.

58:02.100 --> 58:02.930
不了解一个人的本质

文件就是从这发出的
The file came from these coordinates.

58:42.390 --> 58:44.450

59:18.040 --> 59:20.850
罗杰斯  我说集合
Rogers! I said fall in!

59:22.540 --> 59:23.750
这里没戏
This is a dead end.

59:23.750 --> 59:26.900
没热成像  没信号  连无线电波都没有
Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio.

59:28.130 --> 59:29.040
编写文件的人
Whoever wrote the file

59:29.040 --> 59:31.310
应该用了路由器  防止别人追踪
must have used a router to throw people off.

59:33.030 --> 59:34.020
怎么了
What is it?

59:34.170 --> 59:36.140
军规有规定  营房五百码范围内
Army regulations forbid storing ammunition

59:36.140 --> 59:38.280
禁止存放弹药
within five hundred yards from the barracks.

59:38.820 --> 59:40.720
这栋建筑不该建在这
This building is in the wrong place.

59:56.080 --> 59:57.510
这是神盾局的地方
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.580
可能是在这成立的
Maybe where it started.

在这么隐秘的地方工作
If you already working in a secret office

01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.320
为什么还要藏着电梯
why do you need to hide the elevator?

01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:54.490
数据源不可能在这里  这些都是老古董了
This can't be the data-point, this technology is ancient.

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:20.990
是否启动系统

输入  是
Y-E-S, spells yes.

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:31.960
我们玩个游戏吧

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:36.070
-这是一部电影[1933《战争游戏》]的台词  -我看过

01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:06.920

1972年  我被确诊为癌症晚期
In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis.

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:35.700
科学拯救不了我的身体  但我的思想
Science could not save my body, my mind, however,

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.940
必须要留存
that was worth saving

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.880

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:49.420
忘记拿手机了
I forgot my phone.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:58.220
勒娜特  你真该敲门的
Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked.

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:23.380
早啊
Hey, man.

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.480
真抱歉  我们需要避避风头
I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.

01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:29.150
认识的人都想杀了我们
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.050
除了我
Not everyone.

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:51.410
你没事吧
You okay?

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:52.460
没事
Yeah.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.260
怎么了
What's going on?

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:06.850
我当初加入神盾局的时候
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D,

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:08.550
还以为有多光明正大
I thought it was going straight.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.950
其实也就是从克格勃换到了九头蛇
But I guess I just traded in the KGB for Hydra.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:24.320
我本以为知道我在为谁撒谎  但...
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:29.610
现在我也分不清了
I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.610
人生总有走错路的时候
There's a chance you might be in the wrong business.

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:39.840
我欠你个人情
I owe you.

01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:42.380
没什么
It's okay.

01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:44.470
换成是我
If it was the other way around,

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:47.840
你的命攥在我手里
and it was down to me to save your life,

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.520
说实话
and you be honest with me,

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.370
你会把性命托付给我吗
would you trust me to do it?

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:56.990
现在会了
I would now.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.020
我从不说谎
And I'm always honest.

01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:04.530
刚发现自己白牺牲了一次
Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:06.510
你还能这么乐观
who just found out they died for nothing.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.010
我知道对手是谁就很开心了
Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:12.680
我做了早饭
I made breakfast.

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:16.000
你们吃人间烟火吧
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.800
问题是
So, the question is:

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.500
神盾局里有谁有能力在境内发射导弹
who in S.H.I.E.L.D could launch a domestic missile strike?

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.190
皮尔斯
Pierce.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.120
他碰巧正坐在
Who happens to be sitting

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:27.190
全世界最安全的大楼顶层
on top of the most secure building in the world.

01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:28.320
但他不是孤军奋战
But he's not working alone,

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.220
佐拉的算法在雷姆利亚星号上
Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.

01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:33.770
贾斯珀·西特韦尔也在上面
So was Jasper Sitwell.

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:38.060
所以最关键的问题是
So, the real question is:

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.160
两个华盛顿的头号通缉犯
how do the two most wanted people in Washington

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.760
怎么在光天化日下绑架神盾局官员
kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D officer in broad daylight?

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.500
答案是  不需要绑架
The answer is: you don't.

01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:46.980
这是什么
What's this?

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.210
算是简历吧
Call it a resume.

01:11:51.650 --> 01:11:52.950
这是巴马拉吗
Is this Bakhmala?

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.580
你参加了哈立德·汗迪尔任务
The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.390
你可没说他是空降救援
You didn't say he was a para-rescue.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.760
这位是莱利吗
Is this Riley?

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.870
没错
Yeah.

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:04.810
我听说因为有火箭弹  直升机飞不进去
I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.080
你们用的是什么  隐形降落伞吗
What did you use, a stealth chute?

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.620
不  是这个
No. These.

01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:15.420
你不是说自己是飞行员吗
I thought you said you're a pilot.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.160
我可没说过
I never said a pilot.

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:22.700
我不能请你帮忙  山姆
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:24.470
你退役是有原因的
You got out for a good reason.

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:26.440
伙计  美国队长要我帮忙
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.410
这理由还不够吗
There's no better reason to get back in.

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.790
这东西哪能拿到
Where can we get our hands on one of these things?

01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:35.540
最后一套在米德堡
The last one is at Fort Meade,

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:39.100
三道防护门和一堵十二英寸厚的钢墙后面
behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall.

01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:42.660
应该没什么问题
Shouldn't be a problem.

01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:44.710

我今晚得飞回家
Listen, I gotta fly home tonight,

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:49.020
选区出了点问题
cause I got some constituency problem,

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.050
我得处理一下
and I gotta press the flesh.

01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:53.760
是哪位选民有问题吗  议员先生
Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?

01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:55.850
不算是吧
Uh...no, not really.

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:59.890
二十三岁  有点火辣  相当辣
Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot.

01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:01.920
我记得她想当个记者
You know, wants to be a reporter, I think.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.880
不记得了  谁有心思听她说话
I don't know, who listens at that point?

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.670
好像不是大问题啊
Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:08.200
是吗  她把我的后背抓的疼死了
Really? Cause she's killing my back.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.620
这地方不适合谈这些
Look, this isn't the place to talk about it.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:11.870
别针不错
That's a nice pin.

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:13.960
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:15.490

我们去兜个风
You and I are gonna take a ride.

01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:08.950
我为什么要听你的
And why would I do that?

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:12.120
因为那条领带看起来挺贵的
Because that tie looks really expensive,

01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:14.170
我不想弄脏了
and I'd hate to mess it up.

你在雷姆利亚星号上干了什么
What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?

晕船了  一直在吐
I was throwing up, I get seasick.

01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:37.230
搞这出是想暗示我
Is this little display meant to insinuate

01:14:37.230 --> 01:14:38.880
你能把我从屋顶扔下去吗
that you can throw me off the roof?

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:41.540
这可不是你的作风  罗杰斯
Cause it's really not your style, Rogers.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.240
说对了  的确不是
You're right. It's not.

01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:47.340

我还是没法接受唇环
Yeah, I'm not ready for that.

老天  皮尔斯会杀了我的
Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:09.040
然后呢
What then?!

01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:15.500
然后洞察计划的直升航母会除掉他们
Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list.

我知道  我们用他绕过DNA扫描
I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:36.270
直接上直升航母
and access the Helicarriers directly.

01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:38.030
什么  你们疯了吗
What?! Are you crazy?

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.410
这主意糟透了
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:24.970
我靠

怎么可能
How's that even possible?

都七十年过去了

01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:53.820

可能就是因为这样  他摔下火车后活了下来
Whatever he did, it helped Bucky survive the fall.

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:03.780
他们一定找到了他
They must have found him.

None of that's your fault, Steve.

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.200
即使我一无所有的时候  我还有巴基
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:16.020
快找个医生过来
We need to get a doctor here.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.240
如果不压紧伤口
We don't put pressure on that wound

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.980
她会失血过多死在车上的
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:29.070
这玩意压得我头疼
That thing was squeezing my brain.

01:25:32.730 --> 01:25:33.720
这人是谁
Who's this guy?

01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:45.920
三个坑  开挖吧
Three holes. Start digging.

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.900
她中枪了  失血一品脱
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:16.720
也许有两品脱
Maybe two.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.750
交给我吧
Let me take her!

01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:19.370
她会想先见见他的
She'll wants to see him first.

01:26:29.010 --> 01:26:31.210
终于来了
About damn time.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:36.790
脊柱损伤  胸骨断裂
Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum,

01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:40.110
锁骨粉碎  肝穿孔
shattered collarbone, perforated liver,

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:42.110
再加上要命的头疼
one hell of a headache.

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:43.960
别忘了肺萎陷
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.610
对  这可不能忘了  除此之外都挺好
Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.860
可他们给你做了开膛手术  你心跳都停了
They cut you open, your heart stopped.

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:54.140
河豚毒素B  能把脉搏降到一分钟一下
Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.200
班纳发明用来控制压力的
Banner developed it for stress.

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:59.020
对他没多大作用  但我们发现了它的新用途
Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.960
为什么要这么保密  为什么不告诉我们
Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.820
为了让意图谋害局长的人以为暗杀成功了
Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.090
死人不能再死一次
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:10.910
另外  我也不知道还能相信谁
Besides, I wasn't sure who to trust.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.500
<b>银  行</b>

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.560
巴恩斯中士
Sergeant Barnes...

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:30.780
巴基  不
Bucky, no!

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:37.520
改造程序已经开始了
The procedure has already started.

01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:45.250
你将会成为九头蛇的新武器
You are to be the new face of Hydra.

01:27:45.330 --> 01:27:46.690
把他冷冻起来
Put him on ice.

01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:02.150
长官  他  他状态不稳定  情绪失常
Sir, he's...he's unstable. Erratic.

01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.420
任务汇报
Mission report.

01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:21.850
开始任务汇报
Mission report, now.

01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:36.020
桥上的那个人
The man on the bridge...

01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:40.120
他是谁
Who was he?

01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:44.570
这星期早些时候你执行另一个任务时见过他
You met him earlier this week on another assignment.

01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:48.400
我认识他
I knew him.

01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:59.670
你做的事造福了全人类
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.400
你塑造了这个世纪
You shaped this century,

01:29:04.190 --> 01:29:06.510
我需要你再做一次
and I need you to do it one more time.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.240
人类社会正处在秩序与混乱的临界点
Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos.

01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:13.700
明天早上我们要帮他们抉择
Tomorrow morning we're gonna give it a push.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.470
但如果你不完成你的任务  我就没法着手
But if you don't do your part, I can't do mine,

01:29:20.410 --> 01:29:23.520
九头蛇就没法还世界它应得的自由
and Hydra can't give the world the freedom it deserves.

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:27.510
可我认识他
But I knew him.

01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.480
给他准备
Prep him.

01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:38.790
他脱离低温冷冻太久了
He's been out of cryo-freeze too long.

01:29:39.010 --> 01:29:41.180
那就给他洗脑  重新来过
Then wipe him and start over.

01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:26.620
这个人拒绝接受诺贝尔和平奖
This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.310
亚历山大·皮尔斯
参谋长联席会议

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:30.540
他说  和平不是一项成就
He said, "Peace wasn't an achievement,

01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:32.900
而是一种责任
it was a responsibility."

01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:37.850
就是这种事害得我有了信任危机
See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.

01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:39.420
我们得阻止航母发射
We have to stop the launch.

01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:43.150
我觉得理事会不会再接我的电话了
I don't think the Council's accepting my calls anymore.

01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:46.350
这是什么
What's that?

01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:49.320
直升航母飞到三千英尺高后
Once the Helicarriers reach three thousand feet,

01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:51.680
会利用洞察卫星三角定位
they'll triangulate with Insight Satellites

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:51.650
洞 察 计 划

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.560
变成杀伤性武器
becoming fully weaponized.

01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:54.550
洞 察 计 划

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.230
我们必须渗入航母
We need to breach those carriers

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:56.200
洞 察 计 划

01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:58.190
将上面的定位模块换成我们自己的
and replace their targeting blades with our own.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.490
洞 察 计 划

01:30:58.190 --> 01:30:59.190
只换一两个没用
One or two won't cut it.

01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:01.990
必须把三艘航母都连接到一起
We need to link all three carriers for this to work,

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:05.080
因为即使只剩一艘航母正常运转
because if even one of those ships remains operational

01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:07.430
还是会死很多人
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:10.950
我们必须假设航母上的都是九头蛇的人
We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is Hydra.

01:31:11.050 --> 01:31:12.050
我们得闯过他们那一关
We need to get pass them,

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:13.720
把模块插进服务器  也许
insert the server blades, and maybe,

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:16.260
只是也许  我们可以挽救
just maybe, we can salvage what's left...

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:17.740
我们什么都不挽救
We're not salvaging anything.

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:19.060
我们不止要摧毁航母
We're not just taking down the carriers,

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:20.300
尼克  我们还要打倒神盾局
Nick, we're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.740
神盾局跟此事无关
S.H.I.E.L.D had nothing to do with it.

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:24.120
你把任务交给我  结果就是这样
You gave me this mission, this is how it ends.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.130
神盾局被九头蛇渗透了
S.H.I.E.L.D's been compromised,

01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:26.400
这是你自己说的
you've said so yourself.

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.410
九头蛇在就在你眼皮底下  却没有人发现
Hydra was right under your nose and nobody noticed.

01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:30.820
我们为什么要在这个山洞里见面
Why do you think we're meeting in this cave?

01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:31.730
因为我发现了
I noticed.

01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:33.910
在你发现之前有多少人付出了生命的代价
And how many paid the price before you did?

01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:38.600
我真的不知道巴恩斯的事
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:40.460
就算你知道  你会告诉我吗
Even if you have, would you have told me?

01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:42.830
还是继续你所谓的各司其职
Or would you have compartmentalized that too?

01:31:43.690 --> 01:31:47.850
神盾局  九头蛇  一个都不能留
S.H.I.E.L.D, Hydra, it all goes.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.410
他说得对
He's right.

01:31:55.570 --> 01:31:56.640
别看我
Don't look at me.

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.770
他做什么我就做什么  就是比他慢点
I do what he does, just slower.

01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:03.240
好吧
Well...

01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:12.870
看来现在该由你来下令了  队长
Looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:25.810
我们找过你
We looked for you after.

01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:29.160
我父母想开车从墓地送你回家
My folks wanted to give you a ride from the cemetery.

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:30.080
我知道  很抱歉
I know, I'm sorry.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.790
我只是  想一个人待一会儿
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.040
葬礼怎么样
How was it?

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:38.980
就那样吧  我妈葬在了我爸身旁
It was okay. She's next to Dad.

01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:42.630
我想问你...
I was gonna ask...

01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:45.250
我知道你想问什么  巴基  只是我
I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:48.560
我们可以像小时候那样  把沙发垫铺在地板上
We can put the couch cushion on the floor like when we were kids.

01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:51.330
多好玩啊  你只要帮我擦擦鞋
It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes,

01:32:51.330 --> 01:32:53.460
或者倒个垃圾什么的就行了
maybe take out the trash.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:32:59.940
来吧
Come on.

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:06.940
谢谢  巴基  不过我自己能行
Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.

01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:11.150
问题是  你不必这样
The thing is, you don't have to.

01:33:14.670 --> 01:33:16.800
我会陪你走到最后的  哥们
I'm with you till the end of the line, pal.

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:20.950
他一定会在那儿
He's gonna be there, you know?

01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:22.270
我知道
I know.

01:33:23.010 --> 01:33:26.390
听着  不管他以前怎么样  现在的他
Look, whoever he used to be, the guy he is now,

01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:29.020
不值得你去拯救了
I don't think he's the kind you save.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.930
你需要阻止他
He's the kind you stop.

01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:35.030
我不知道我下不下得去手
I don't know if I could do that.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.270
他也许会逼得你没得选
Well, he might not give you a choice.

01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:38.650
他不记得你了
He doesn't know you.

01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:40.660
他会的
He will.

01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:45.260
时间到了  准备出发
Gear up, it's time.

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:48.810
你就穿这身去吗
You gonna wear that?

01:33:48.810 --> 01:33:50.400
不  要去打仗
No. If you're gonna fight a war,

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:51.940
就得穿上军装
you gotta wear a uniform.

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.940
完了  饭碗丢了
Oh, man. I am so fired!

01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:31.670
进入发射的最后阶段
We are in final launch sequence.

01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:33.580
洞察 发射

01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:35.630
制导系统就绪
We are go on guidance.

01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:39.270
所有人员请前往发射台
All personnel, to launch station.

01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:41.270
飞行旅途如何
And how was your flight?

01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:44.590
很不错  不过从机场来这的路上不怎么样
Lovely. The ride from the airport less so.

01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:47.130
很遗憾神盾局没法控制一切
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D can't control everything.

01:34:47.630 --> 01:34:49.300
包括美国队长
Including Captain America.

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:55.700
这里的身份认证靠生物识别
This facility is biometrically controlled,

01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:58.580
这胸章能让你们在这里畅通无阻
and these will give you unrestricted access.

01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:03.910
我把车停在这两个月了
I've been parking there for two months.

01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:04.860
可这是他的车位
But it's his spot.

01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.720
那他去哪了
So where's he been?

01:35:05.730 --> 01:35:07.040
大概去阿富汗了吧
I think Afghanistan.

01:35:07.050 --> 01:35:09.300
不可以  DT-6  着陆航线已满
Negative, DT-6. The pattern is full.

01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:10.720
他可以事先说明的
Well, he could have said something.

01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:13.700
天线出问题了吧
Must be the dish.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:16.650
我去看看
I'll check it out.

01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:25.650
麻烦让一下
Excuse us.

01:35:25.650 --> 01:35:28.370
我知道过程很坎坷
I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth,

01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:29.430
你们中可能有人
and some of you would

01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:32.310
早就看我不顺眼了
have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way.

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:37.520
我们终于齐聚在这  全世界都将心存感激
Finally we're here, and the world should be grateful.

01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:40.410
所有神盾局特工注意
Attention, all S.H.I.E.L.D agents.

01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:41.950
我是史蒂夫·罗杰斯
This is Steve Rogers.

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:46.360
这几天你们听到了不少我的消息
You've heard a lot about me over the last few days,

01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:49.540
有些人甚至奉命追捕我
some of you were even ordered to hunt me down.

01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:52.420
但我认为应该告诉你们真相
But I think it's time you know the truth.

01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:58.510
神盾局并不是我们想象的样子
S.H.I.E.L.D is not what we thought it was,

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:01.830
它已经被九头蛇渗透了
it's been taken over by Hydra.

01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:03.700
他们的首领是亚历山大·皮尔斯
Alexander Pierce is their leader.

01:36:07.230 --> 01:36:09.700
突击队和洞察计划也被渗透了
The S.T.R.I.K.E and Insight crew are Hydra as well.

01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:13.740
我不知道还有多少  但他们在这里
I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building.

01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:16.820
可能就站在你身边
They could be standing right next to you.

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.780
他们差点如愿以偿  得到绝对控制权
They almost have what they want: absolute control.

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:27.450
尼克·弗瑞的被害只是个开始
They shot the Nick Fury and it won't end there.

01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:29.640
如果你们今天发射了直升航母
If you launch those helicarriers today,

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:31.190
九头蛇将能够杀死
Hydra will be able to kill anyone

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.690
任何妨碍他们计划的人
that stands in their way,

01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:36.660
除非我们阻止他们
unless we stop them.

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:42.350
我知道这很难做到
I know I'm asking a lot,

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:46.980
但自由的代价一向是高昂的
but the price of freedom is high, it always has been,

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.610
我愿意付出这代价
and it's a price I'm willing to pay.

01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:54.280
哪怕只有我一个人  我也会坚持到底
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:57.960
但我相信我不是一个人
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:04.600
你是背的稿子
Did you write that down first,

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:06.480
还是临场发挥的
or was it off the top of your head?

01:37:06.730 --> 01:37:09.100
你这婊子养的
You smug son of a bitch.

01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:14.000
把他抓起来

提前发射进程

01:37:26.410 --> 01:37:27.910
现在就把航母送上天

01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:33.480
你有意见吗
Is there a problem?

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.590
我
I'm...

01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:39.880
你有意见吗
Is there a problem?

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.970
抱歉  长官

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:57.700
离开你的操作台

01:37:58.090 --> 01:37:59.180

队长有令

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:07.010
你站错边了  特工
You picked the wrong side, agent.

01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:09.890
先看看自己的处境吧
Depends on where you're standing.

01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:55.880
关闭舰湾闸门
Close the bay door!

01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:59.210

他们启动发射了
They're initiating launch.

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.010
队长
Hey, Cap,

01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.890
怎么区分坏人和好人
how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?

01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:44.810
朝你开枪的就是坏人
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:18.830
队长
Hey, Cap,

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:21.210

01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.430
容我问一个问题
Let me ask you a question.

如果巴基斯坦明天攻进了孟买
What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow,

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:42.650
而你清楚地知道
and you knew that they were gonna

01:40:42.650 --> 01:40:46.910
他们会把你们的女儿拖到足球场里处决
drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution?

01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:50.260
而你按一下按钮
And you could just stop

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:54.880
就能阻止这一切  你会按吗  你们呢
it with a flick of a switch. Would you? Wouldn't you all?

01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:59.280
我不用你的按钮
Not if it was your switch.

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.400
抱歉
I'm sorry.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.580

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:41.940
我在努力了
Working on it.

01:42:50.530 --> 01:42:51.460
你在做什么
What are you doing?

01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:52.820
她在解除安全协议

01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:55.380
把所有秘密公布到网上

Including Hydra's.

01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:59.320
也有神盾局的  一旦你这么做

你们的过去就都大白于天下了
none of your past is gonna remain hidden.

01:43:04.530 --> 01:43:05.320

Are you sure you're ready

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.250
全世界都看到你的真面目吗

01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:10.670
那你呢

全体神盾局飞行员  紧急起飞

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:30.040
我们是罗杰斯队长仅有的空中支援
We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got.

01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:12.340
访问 受限

01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:14.040
解锁是行政命令
Disabling the encryption is an executive order,

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.940
需要两名A级人员
it takes two Alpha Level members.

01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:19.310

01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:56.550
为什么让我做神盾局局长

混乱  战争  脏弹袭击莫斯科
Disorder, war. It's just a matter of time

01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:13.740
或者EMP轰炸芝加哥只是迟早的事

01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:20.800
靠外交吗  治标不治本
Diplomacy? Holding action, a band-aid.

01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:25.790
你知道我是在哪里想清楚的  波哥大[哥伦比亚]

01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:30.290
你没有问  只是做了该做的事
You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done.

01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:33.330
牺牲两百万性命
I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people

01:46:33.330 --> 01:46:36.370

如果你敢迈出去  这就是下一步  尼克
It's the next step, Nick, if you have the courage to take it.

01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:42.570

虹膜扫描开启

01:46:50.590 --> 01:46:52.900
你以为我们不会取消你的权限吗

我知道你删了我的密码  应该还有扫描记录
I know you erased my password, probably deleted my retinal scan,

01:46:57.430 --> 01:47:01.050
但如果你想先我一步  部长先生
but if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary...

01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:07.770
就得时刻瞪大双眼
You need to keep both eyes open.

01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:14.070

01:57:47.410 --> 01:57:48.940
不可能
Not an option!

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.640
41楼  41楼
41st floor! 41st!

01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:07.170
他们又没把楼层号
It's not like they put the floor numbers

01:58:07.170 --> 01:58:09.110
标在大楼的外墙上
on the outside of the building!

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.740
希尔  史蒂夫呢  知道罗杰斯在哪吗
Hill, where's Steve? You got a location on Rogers?

01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:30.600
你认识我
You know me.

01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:33.600
我不认识
No, I don't!

01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:47.440
巴基  你从小就认识我
Bucky, you've known me your whole life.

01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:59.030
你的名字是詹姆斯·布坎南·巴恩斯
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

01:58:59.030 --> 01:59:00.190
闭嘴
Shut up!

01:59:08.930 --> 01:59:12.680
我是不会跟你打的
I'm not gonna fight you.

01:59:14.650 --> 01:59:15.920
你是我的朋友
You're my friend.

01:59:22.750 --> 01:59:24.080
你是我的任务
You're my mission.

01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:33.060
那就完成任务
Then finish it.

01:59:36.270 --> 01:59:38.800
因为我会陪你走到最后的
Cause I'm with you till the end of the line.

02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:51.070
在你左边
On your left.

02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:12.690
斯塔克工业

02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:52.290
为什么现在还没有罗杰斯队长的消息
Why haven't we yet heard from Captain Rogers?

02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:56.070
我不知道他还有什么可说的
I don't know what's left for him to say.

02:02:56.070 --> 02:02:57.240
我认为波托马克河
I think the rock in the middle

02:02:57.250 --> 02:02:59.610
中央的残骸已经表明了一切
of the Potomac made his point fairly eloquently.

02:02:59.610 --> 02:03:01.820
他可以解释一下  这个国家该怎么
Well, he could explain how this country's expected to

02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:04.400
维护自己的安全
maintain its national security now that

02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:08.350
因为你们俩毁掉了我们的情报机构
he and you have laid waste our intelligence apparatus.

02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:10.420
九头蛇卖给你们的是谎言  不是情报
Hydra was selling you lies, not intelligence.

02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:13.450
好像大部分都是你亲自告诉我们的
Many of which you seem to have had a personal hand in telling.

02:03:13.450 --> 02:03:15.220
特工  你应该知道
Agent, you should know that

02:03:15.220 --> 02:03:17.350
委员会中有些成员
there are some on this committee who feel,

02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:18.860
考虑到你既服务过这个国家
given your service record,

02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:21.620
也背叛过这个国家
both for this country and against it,

02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:26.140
你应该被处以监禁  而不是在国会山和我们顶嘴
that you belong in a penitentiary, not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:29.370
你们不会把我关进监狱的
You're not gonna put me in a prison.

02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:34.440
你们不会把任何人关进去的  知道为什么吗
You're not gonna put any of us in a prison. You know why?

02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:37.000
请指点吧
Do enlighten us.

02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:38.590
因为你们需要我们
Because you need us.

02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:41.920
是的  这个世界很脆弱
Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,

02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:43.970
是的  我们对此负有责任
and yes, we helped make it that way.

02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:47.700
但我们也是最能保护它的人
But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it.

02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:51.280
所以你们要想逮捕我  就动手吧
So if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:53.600
你们知道去哪里找我
You'll know where to find me.

02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:32.530
你之前经历过这种事情
So, you've experienced this sort of things before?

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:34.040
你会习惯的
You get used to it.

02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:36.840
<b>尼古拉斯·弗瑞上校</b>

02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.820
<b>正义的一生</b>

02:04:36.650 --> 02:04:39.030
我们在挖掘九头蛇的资料
We've been data-mining Hydra's files.

02:04:39.330 --> 02:04:41.850
好像有很多漏网之鱼
Looks Like a lot of rats didn't go down with the ship.

02:04:43.090 --> 02:04:46.940
我今晚启程去欧洲  你要一起吗
I'm heading to Europe tonight, wanted to ask if you'd come.

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:49.560
我还有事要做
There's something I gotta do first.

02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:53.330
你呢  威尔森  我需要你这样的人
How about you, Wilson? I could use a man with your abilities.

02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:55.890
比起间谍  我更喜欢当士兵
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:57.770
好吧
Alright then.

02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:07.410
要是有人问起我  让他们来这里找我
Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me right here.

02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:09.630
你该感到荣幸
You should be honored,

02:05:09.630 --> 02:05:12.270
这是他说的最客气的话了
that's about as close as he gets to saying thank you.

02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:14.740
你不跟他一起吗
Not going with him?

02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:16.290
不
No.

02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:17.380
也不留下
Not staying here?

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:22.070
我的身份全都暴露了  我得去弄个新的
I blew all my covers, I gotta go figure out a new one.

02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:23.120
那得花上一段时间
That might take a while.

02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:24.850
正好歇一阵子
I'm counting on it.

02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:28.770
你要的那个东西
That thing you asked for,

02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:31.180
我找基辅的几个朋友帮了些忙
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:30.580
第17号案件

02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:31.140
第17号案件

02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:37.120
算是帮我个忙  约那个护士吧
Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.

02:05:37.250 --> 02:05:38.480
她可不是护士
She's not a nurse.

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:40.290
你也不是神盾局特工
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D agent.

02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:42.310
她叫什么来着
What was her name again?

02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:45.370
雪伦  她很不错的
Sharon. She's nice.

02:05:57.650 --> 02:05:58.780
小心点  史蒂夫
Be careful, Steve.

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:02.190
里面的东西你要做好心理准备
You might not want to pull on that thread.

02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:14.580
你要去找他吗
You're going after him?

02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:16.870
你不必跟我一起来
You don't have to come with me.

02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:21.100
我知道  什么时候出发
I know. When do we start?

02:08:20.610 --> 02:08:21.650
结束了
It's over.

02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:24.370
弗瑞将一切都公之于众了
Fury has released everything to the public.

02:08:25.190 --> 02:08:26.870
只公布了他知道的信息
Everything he knows about.

02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:28.900
斯托克先生  如果他们知道我们在这里做的事
Mr. Strucker, if they get word of our work here,

02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:30.870
如果他们知道我们服务于九头蛇
if they find out we serve Hydra...

02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:33.140
九头蛇  神盾局
Hydra, S.H.I.E.L.D,

02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:37.080
两个都一样  现在都不行了
two sides of a coin that's no longer currency.

02:08:40.330 --> 02:08:46.390
我们拥有的东西  价值是他们无法想象的
What we have is worth more than any of them ever knew.

02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:52.690
我们只接触到了点皮毛  就已经...
We've only scratched the surface and already...

02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:00.000
世界上还有其他为九头蛇工作的机构
There are other facilities doing Hydra's good work around the world.

02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:04.220
全丢给美国队长和他那帮乱七八糟的朋友
We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends.

02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:06.130
引开他们的注意
Keep them off our scent.

02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:08.290
那些志愿者呢
What about the volunteers?

02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:11.040
死了的会被埋得很深
The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts

02:09:11.050 --> 02:09:12.950
谁都不会找到
won't be able to find them.

02:09:14.850 --> 02:09:16.170
幸存者呢
And the survivors?

02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:19.430
那对双胞胎
The twins.

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:26.310
他们迟早会遇见那对双胞胎
Sooner or later they will meet the twins.

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:32.420
这早已不是间谍的世界了  甚至也不是英雄的世界
It's not a world of spies anymore, not even a world of heroes.

02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:36.660
这是属于奇迹的时代  博士
This is the age of miracles, doctor.

02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:43.430
没有什么比奇迹更恐怖了
There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.
