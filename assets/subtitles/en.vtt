Steve Jobs: When you grow up,
you tend to get told

00:08.106 --> 00:10.243
that the world is the way it is,

00:10.276 --> 00:14.747
and your life is just to live
your life inside the world;

00:14.780 --> 00:17.583
try not to bash
into the walls too much.

00:17.616 --> 00:20.319
But life can be much broader

00:20.352 --> 00:22.889
once you discover
one simple fact

00:22.922 --> 00:25.958
and that is, everything
around you that you call life

00:25.991 --> 00:30.063
was made up by people
that were no smarter than you.

00:30.096 --> 00:32.632
And you can change it.
You can influence it.

00:32.665 --> 00:36.969
You can build your own things
that other people can use.

Good evening.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.408
I'm Steve Jobs
from Apple Computer.

00:42.441 --> 00:44.777
We're very glad
to be here tonight.

00:44.810 --> 00:47.213
I think you always
had to be a little different

00:47.246 --> 00:48.948
to buy an Apple computer.

00:48.981 --> 00:51.084
And I think you still
have to think differently

00:51.117 --> 00:53.386
to buy an Apple computer.

00:53.419 --> 00:55.588
And I think the people
that do buy them,

00:55.621 --> 00:57.990
they are the people that are not
just out to get a job done --

00:58.023 --> 01:00.660
they're out to change the world.

01:00.693 --> 01:04.197
What a computer is to me,
is it's the most remarkable tool

01:04.230 --> 01:06.265
that we've ever come up with,

01:06.298 --> 01:09.402
and it's the equivalent
of a bicycle for our minds.

01:09.435 --> 01:11.871
This is iMac.
The whole thing is translucent.

01:11.904 --> 01:14.474
You can see into it.
It's so cool.

01:14.507 --> 01:15.641
Pleased to announce today

01:15.674 --> 01:17.210
that I'm going to drop
the interim title.

01:17.243 --> 01:22.115
[CHEERING]

01:22.148 --> 01:24.617
It is to stand
at the intersection

01:24.650 --> 01:29.856
of technology and humanity
and to make something for people

01:29.889 --> 01:33.993
that want to bring this
into their lives and use it

01:34.026 --> 01:35.928
for things that make them
more creative,

01:35.961 --> 01:38.397
not just make them
more productive. [APPLAUSE]

01:38.430 --> 01:42.368
This amazing little device
holds a thousand songs,

01:42.401 --> 01:44.537
and it goes right in my pocket.

01:44.570 --> 01:51.377
An iPod, a phone,
and an internet communicator.

01:51.410 --> 01:52.578
Audience member: Woo!

[APPLAUSE INTENSIFIES]

02:08.127 --> 02:12.131
We have a chance, if we stay
focused and choose wisely,

02:12.164 --> 02:16.235
to really continue
to impact people's lives

02:16.268 --> 02:18.404
in some small way,
for the better.

02:18.437 --> 02:20.806
[APPLAUSE]

02:20.839 --> 02:24.143
There's an old
Wayne Gretzky quote that I love.

02:24.176 --> 02:26.245
"I skate to where
the puck is going to be,

02:26.278 --> 02:28.314
not where it has been."

02:28.347 --> 02:31.417
And we've always tried
to do that at Apple

02:31.450 --> 02:33.819
since the very, very beginning.

02:33.852 --> 02:36.789
And we always will.

02:36.822 --> 02:40.259
So, thank you very, very much
for being a part of this.
