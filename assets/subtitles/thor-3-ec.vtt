WEBVTT

00:54.570 --> 00:56.030
我知道你在想什么
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.120
不  托尔被关在笼子里了  怎么回事
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen?"

00:59.990 --> 01:01.740
有时  你得先被抓住
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

01:01.740 --> 01:03.910
才能从某人那里问出个所以然来
just to get a straight answer out of somebody.

01:04.910 --> 01:08.000
说来话长  但其实  我算是个英雄
It's a long story, but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

01:09.590 --> 01:11.460
我去地球待了一阵
See, I spent some time on Earth...

01:12.340 --> 01:15.470
打过几个机器人  救了地球几次
Fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.180
然后我去宇宙中寻找
Then I went searching through the cosmos

01:17.180 --> 01:20.720
几颗有魔法的多彩的无限宝石
for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things.

01:21.100 --> 01:22.180
但没找到
Didn't find any.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.440
这时我遇到了一条死亡和毁灭之路
That's when I came across a path of death and destruction,

01:27.770 --> 01:31.110
而因此来到了这个笼子里
which led me all the way here into this cage,

01:32.400 --> 01:33.570
还遇见了你
where I met you.

01:39.740 --> 01:41.660
你觉得我们还要在这里待多久
How much longer do you think we'll be here?

01:55.470 --> 01:58.630
托尔  奥丁之子
Thor, son of Odin.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.350
苏尔特尔  王八之子
Surtur, son of a bitch.

02:03.350 --> 02:04.680
你还活着
You're still alive.

02:04.930 --> 02:08.940
我以为我父亲50万年前杀掉你了
I thought my father killed you like, a half a million years ago.

02:08.940 --> 02:10.690
我不能死
I cannot die.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.690
我还没有实现命运
Not until I fulfill my destiny

02:12.690 --> 02:14.860
毁灭你的家乡
and lay waste to your home.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.650
正好你提起这个了
You know, it's funny you should mention that.

02:16.650 --> 02:19.070
因为我最近一直在做噩梦
Because I've been having these terrible dreams of late.

02:19.070 --> 02:21.490
阿斯加德陷入烈火  成为一片灰烬
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

02:21.490 --> 02:24.450
而你  苏尔特尔  处于那一切之中
And you, Surtur, are at the center of all of them.

02:24.490 --> 02:28.710
那你已经见识到了诸神黄昏  阿斯加德的陨落
Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.920
-伟大的预言  -等等
- The great prophecy... - Hang on.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.580
等等
Hang on.

02:33.250 --> 02:36.090
我马上就能转回去
I'll be back around shortly.

02:36.420 --> 02:38.550
我真觉得我们刚刚聊得很投机
I really feel like we were connecting there.

02:41.800 --> 02:45.260
好了  诸神黄昏  跟我讲讲  仔细说说
Okay, so Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.140
我的时代到来了
My time has come.

02:47.310 --> 02:50.770
等我的王冠再次沐浴永恒烈火
When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame,

02:50.770 --> 02:53.480
我就将恢复全部力量
I shall be restored to my full might.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.820
比山还高
I will tower over the mountains,

02:55.820 --> 02:58.740
把剑深深插入阿斯加德的...
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

02:58.740 --> 03:00.820
等等  等一下
Hang on. Give it a second.

03:01.530 --> 03:04.200
我发誓  我根本没动  是它自己在转
I swear, I'm not even moving. It's just doing this on its own.

03:04.530 --> 03:05.990
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.450
好了  是这么回事吗
Okay, so let me get this straight.

03:08.830 --> 03:12.790
你要把你的王冠放进永恒烈火里
You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame

03:12.790 --> 03:15.250
然后你会突然变得有房子那么大
and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house?

03:15.250 --> 03:16.340
是山
A mountain!

03:16.420 --> 03:19.760
永恒烈火是奥丁锁在阿斯加德的那个
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.590
奥丁不在阿斯加德
Odin is not on Asgard.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.260
而你的离开让王权失去了防卫
And your absence has left the throne defenseless.

03:26.260 --> 03:28.600
好吧  那王冠在哪呢
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

03:28.600 --> 03:32.020
这就是我的王冠  我力量的源泉
This is my crown, the source of my power.

03:32.100 --> 03:35.480
那是王冠啊  我以为你是眉毛长得比较夸张
Oh, that's a crown. I thought it was a big eyebrow.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.650
是王冠
It's a crown.

03:37.020 --> 03:40.280
总之  听上去  我想阻止诸神黄昏
Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok

03:40.280 --> 03:42.320
只需要扯下你脑袋上那玩意
is rip that thing off your head.

03:43.570 --> 03:46.120
但诸神黄昏已经开始了
But Ragnarok has already begun.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.620
你无法阻止
You cannot stop it.

03:57.750 --> 04:01.010
我是阿斯加德的末日  你也是
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

04:01.010 --> 04:05.010
一切都将遭受煎熬  被烈火吞噬
All will suffer, all will burn.

04:05.010 --> 04:06.260
好紧张
That's intense.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.760
老实说  看着你变得老大
To be honest, seeing you grow really big

04:08.760 --> 04:11.560
然后烧掉一颗星球  肯定很壮观
and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.

04:11.890 --> 04:14.310
但看来我只能选择第二条路
But it looks like I'm gonna have to choose option B,

04:14.310 --> 04:16.020
那就是我挣脱这铁链
where I bust out of these chains,

04:16.020 --> 04:17.860
把你的头饰从脑袋上砸下来
knock that tiara off your head,

04:17.860 --> 04:20.110
然后藏在阿斯加德的地堡里
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

04:20.110 --> 04:23.280
你无法阻止诸神黄昏
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.610
何必抵抗呢
Why fight it?

04:24.610 --> 04:28.410
因为  英雄都会这么做
Because that's what heroes do.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.420
等等  抱歉  我时机掐得不太好
Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't time that right.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.880
来了
And, now!

04:41.300 --> 04:46.260
BGM: Immigrant Song  By  Led Zeppelin

04:43.050 --> 04:46.930
你犯了个大错误  奥丁森
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

04:46.930 --> 04:49.510
我经常犯大错误
I make grave mistakes all the time.

04:51.140 --> 04:54.020
看来结果还不错嘛
Everything seems to work out.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.390
海姆达尔  我知道我们好久没联系了
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,

06:14.390 --> 06:16.140
但我真的很需要赶紧离开这里
but I could really use a fast exit.

06:18.060 --> 06:18.890
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

06:20.400 --> 06:22.270
海姆达尔就是个蠢货
Heimdall was an idiot.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.440
这份工作本该让他发财的
This job should have made him rich.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.860
这份工作并不轻松
Now, the job ain't easy

06:26.860 --> 06:29.110
但还是有些好处的
but it does have its benefits.

06:29.110 --> 06:30.700
彩虹桥让我可以接触到
The Bifrost gives me access

06:30.700 --> 06:33.370
九大王国的一切
to everything the Nine Realms has to offer.

06:33.370 --> 06:35.790
我想拿就拿
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.

06:37.250 --> 06:38.500
看啊
Behold...

06:40.750 --> 06:41.920
我的东西
My stuff.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.710
我特别喜欢这俩玩意
I'm particularly fond of these.

06:45.710 --> 06:49.470
我从米德加德一个叫德克萨斯的地方拿到了它们
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard called Texas.

06:49.760 --> 06:53.050
我还给它们起了名字  毁天和灭地
I even named them. Des and Troy.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.970
因为  当它们合在一起
You see, when you put them together,

06:57.060 --> 06:58.310
就能毁天灭地
they destroy.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.120
海姆达尔  拜托了
Heimdall, come on.

07:39.270 --> 07:40.020
别动
Stay!

07:42.190 --> 07:45.110
海姆达尔  我要没招了
Heimdall? I'm running short on options.

07:45.690 --> 07:46.610
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

07:48.570 --> 07:49.570
斯科尔奇
Skurge?

07:52.610 --> 07:54.120
那个要紧吗
Is that important?

08:01.120 --> 08:03.120
你们俩姑娘今天有好戏看了
You girls are in for a treat.

08:26.770 --> 08:37.490
<b>雷神3：诸神黄昏</b>

08:55.890 --> 08:56.760
姑娘们
Girls!

08:58.430 --> 08:59.720
哎呦呦
Well, well, well.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.310
看看是谁决定回来了
Look who decided to pop in.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.730
感谢你吓跑了我的女伴
Thanks for scaring away my company

09:04.730 --> 09:06.770
还弄得我的办公场所全是脑浆
and drenching my workplace in brains.

09:06.770 --> 09:07.560
你是谁
Who are you?

09:07.650 --> 09:09.860
你不记得了吗  斯科尔奇
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.

09:09.860 --> 09:11.320
我们曾在华纳海姆并肩作战
We fought together on Vanaheim.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.190
想起来了
Right.

09:12.860 --> 09:13.940
海姆达尔呢
Where is Heimdall?

09:13.990 --> 09:17.030
那个叛徒  没人知道  他是王室逃犯
That traitor. Well, no one knows. He's a fugitive of the throne.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.070
叛徒
Traitor?

09:18.280 --> 09:21.410
对  奥丁指控海姆达尔玩忽职守
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty

09:21.410 --> 09:23.500
但他在审判前就消失不见了
but he disappeared before the trial.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.920
想抓住一个能洞察宇宙中一切的人可不容易
Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the universe.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.040
-是啊  -等等
- Sure. - Hold on. Hold on.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
我要宣告你的到来的
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.150
这是什么玩意
What the hell is that?

10:02.910 --> 10:05.750
哥哥  时候到了
Oh, brother. This is it.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.960
我要离世了
I take my leave.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.500
你真傻  怎么不听我的
You fool, you didn't listen!

10:10.500 --> 10:11.540
对不起
I'm sorry.

10:11.540 --> 10:12.840
希芙女士  去找人帮忙
Lady Sif, get help!

10:12.840 --> 10:14.380
谁来帮帮忙啊
Somebody, help!

10:14.380 --> 10:16.010
我为我做的一切道歉
I'm sorry for all I've done.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.300
没事的  撑住
It's all right. Hold on.

10:18.340 --> 10:21.760
抱歉我企图统治地球
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.350
有你只会是他们的幸运
They'd be lucky to have you.

10:23.350 --> 10:26.430
宇宙魔方的事我也很抱歉
I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.

10:26.430 --> 10:28.270
-我就是忍不住  -我知道
- I just couldn't help myself. - I know.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.440
-我喜欢耍诡计  -是啊
- I'm a trickster. - Yes.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.940
总爱搞恶作剧
So mischievous.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.480
抱歉我那次把你变成了只青蛙
Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.030
那是很有趣的笑话
It was a wonderful joke.

10:36.150 --> 10:38.240
的确是非常好笑
'Twas indeed hilarious.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.820
你是阿斯加德的拯救者
You are the savior of Asgard.

10:40.820 --> 10:42.530
-讲述我的故事  -我会的
- Tell my story. - I will.

10:42.530 --> 10:44.370
为我建一座雕像
Build a statue for me.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.950
我们会为你建一座大雕像的
We will build a big statue for you.

10:45.950 --> 10:48.790
还要戴着我的头盔  有大弯角的那个
With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.210
你的英勇我会禀告父王
I will tell Father what you did here today.

10:52.630 --> 10:53.840
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.590
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

11:06.560 --> 11:11.190
不
No!

11:12.400 --> 11:15.150
洛基因伤不治而死
And so, Loki died of his wounds,

11:15.230 --> 11:17.440
他为我们献出了生命
giving his life for ours.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.900
他击退了那些可憎的精灵
He fought back those disgusting elves,

11:19.990 --> 11:21.950
为王国带来了和平
he brought peace to the realm.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.620
洛基  我的儿子
Loki, my boy...

11:24.950 --> 11:29.500
多年前  我在那覆满冰霜的战场上发现了你
'Twas many moons ago I found you on that frostbitten battlefield.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.460
那天  我尚未看出你是
On that day, I did not yet see in you

11:32.460 --> 11:34.540
阿斯加德的拯救者  是啊
Asgard's savior. No.

11:34.960 --> 11:39.550
你只是个小蓝冰棍
You were merely a little blue baby icicle

11:40.260 --> 11:43.300
却融化了我这老傻瓜的心
that melted this old fool's heart.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.350
精彩  精彩  演得好
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

11:53.060 --> 11:53.810
父亲
Father.

11:55.310 --> 11:56.070
该死
Shit.

11:56.770 --> 11:59.110
我的儿子  托尔回来了
My son, Thor, has returned!

11:59.110 --> 12:00.690
你好  我的孩子
Greetings, my boy.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.990
这出戏真有趣  叫什么
It's an interesting play. What's it called?

12:03.990 --> 12:06.030
《阿斯加德的洛基之惨剧》
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

12:06.030 --> 12:08.330
人民想纪念他
The people wanted to commemorate him.

12:08.370 --> 12:09.540
他们是该如此
Indeed they should.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.830
我喜欢那座雕像
I like the statue.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.080
比他在世时要好看多了
A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.920
不那么猥琐  油腻了
A little less weaselly, less greasy, maybe.

12:16.790 --> 12:18.880
你知道这是什么吗
Do you know what this is?

12:19.590 --> 12:22.420
苏尔特尔的头骨  厉害的武器啊
The skull of Surtur. That's a formidable weapon!

12:22.420 --> 12:24.130
帮个忙  把这个锁进地堡
Do me a favor. Lock this away in a vault

12:24.130 --> 12:25.800
免得它变成巨大的怪物
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster

12:25.800 --> 12:27.390
毁了整个星球
and destroy the whole planet.

12:28.850 --> 12:29.850
谢谢  亲爱的
Thank you, dear.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.640
那么你要回米德加德了吗
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

12:33.640 --> 12:34.310
不
Nope.

12:35.230 --> 12:37.860
我最近老做同一个梦
I've been having this reoccurring dream lately.

12:38.110 --> 12:40.610
每晚上  我都看到阿斯加德化为灰烬
Every night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.

12:41.190 --> 12:42.530
不过是个没意义的梦
That's just a silly dream,

12:42.530 --> 12:44.740
说明你的想象力太丰富了
signs of an overactive imagination.

12:44.860 --> 12:45.700
或许吧
Possibly.

12:45.740 --> 12:47.780
但我决定出去勘察一番
But then I decide to go out there and investigate.

12:47.780 --> 12:51.950
结果发现  九大王国一片混乱
And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.

12:52.080 --> 12:55.210
阿斯加德的敌人集结起来  阴谋致我们于死地
Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise,

12:55.210 --> 12:58.210
而你  奥丁  九大王国的保护者
all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms,

12:58.210 --> 13:01.130
却穿着浴袍坐在这里  吃着葡萄
are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.

13:01.130 --> 13:03.510
是啊  我们最好尊重邻居的自由
Yes, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom.

13:03.510 --> 13:06.680
是啊  被屠杀的自由
Yes, of course, the freedom to be massacred.

13:08.390 --> 13:10.510
是啊  而且  我一直忙着呢
Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself.

13:10.510 --> 13:11.390
看剧
Watching theater.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.890
委员会会议  安全理事会会议
Well, board meetings, and security council meetings...

13:13.890 --> 13:16.020
-你真要逼我这么做吗  -做什么
- You're really gonna make me do it? - Do what?

13:20.150 --> 13:23.990
你很清楚什么都无法阻止雷神之锤回到我手上
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.

13:23.990 --> 13:25.360
哪怕是你的脸
Not even your face.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.200
你发疯了吧  你会被因此处死的
You've gone quite mad. You'll be executed for this.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.740
那我们就可以在另一边相见了  弟弟
Then I'll see you on the other side, brother.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.290
好吧  我投降
All right, I yield.

你就一份工作  就这一份
You had one job. Just the one.

13:54.770 --> 13:55.640
奥丁在哪
Where's Odin?

13:55.640 --> 13:57.350
你就不能别回来吗
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.900
没有你一切都好好的
Everything was fine without you.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.730
阿斯加德繁荣昌盛  都叫你毁了
Asgard was prospering. You've ruined everything.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.940
-问问他们  -父亲在哪  你杀了他吗
- Ask them. - Where's Father? Did you kill him?

14:04.940 --> 14:07.450
你得到你想要的了  你得到你要的独立了
You had what you wanted. You had the independence you asked for.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.570
好吧  我很清楚他在哪
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

14:18.460 --> 14:21.130

我发誓我就是把他留在这儿的
I swear I left him right here.

14:26.550 --> 14:27.590
是在人行道上
Right here on the sidewalk,

14:27.590 --> 14:29.680
还是在那栋正被拆除的建筑里
or right there where the building is being demolished?

14:29.680 --> 14:30.470
计划得真好
Great planning.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.550
我怎么会知道
How was I supposed to know?

14:31.550 --> 14:33.220
我又不能看到未来  我不是巫师
Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.350
是吗  那你为什么穿得像个巫师
No? Then why do you dress like one?

14:36.020 --> 14:37.640
真不敢相信你还活着
I can't believe you're alive.

14:37.770 --> 14:41.060
我看到你死了  我为你哀悼  为你哭泣
I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you.

14:41.060 --> 14:42.190
我好荣幸
I'm honored.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.400
去问他
Ask him.

14:44.020 --> 14:45.780
你可以跟我们合个影吗
Would you mind taking a picture with us?

14:45.780 --> 14:46.440
当然
Sure.

14:47.860 --> 14:49.610
快想想他在哪
Start figuring out where he is.

14:50.700 --> 14:51.200
天呐
Oh, my God.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.700
很遗憾简甩了你
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

14:53.780 --> 14:55.330
她才没甩我
She didn't dump me, you know.

14:55.910 --> 14:58.120
是我甩了她  我们彼此互甩的
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.

15:00.670 --> 15:02.080
怎么回事  你在做什么
What's this? What are you doing?

15:02.250 --> 15:03.130
这不是我做的
This isn't me.

15:07.590 --> 15:08.300
洛基

雷神
God of Thunder.

15:48.710 --> 15:50.550
你可以把伞放下了
You can put down the umbrella.

16:07.980 --> 16:10.190
地球上现在还有男巫了
So, Earth has wizards now?

16:16.160 --> 16:18.330
我们更喜欢被称为"魔法师"
The preferred term is "Master of the Mystic Arts."

16:18.330 --> 16:19.580
别管了
You can leave that now.

16:20.290 --> 16:23.500
好吧  男巫  你是谁  我为什么要在乎
All right, wizard. Who are you? Why should I care?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.500
我是斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,

16:25.500 --> 16:27.420
我有些问题要问你
and I have some questions for you.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.090
请坐
Take a seat.

Tea?

16:37.640 --> 16:38.680
我不喝茶
I don't drink tea.

16:38.970 --> 16:40.100
你喝什么
What do you drink?

16:40.390 --> 16:41.140
不喝茶
Not tea.

16:44.730 --> 16:46.310
我有一份关注名单
So, I keep a watch list

16:46.310 --> 16:47.940
都是来自其他世界
of individuals and beings from

16:47.940 --> 16:50.320
可能对这个世界构成威胁的人
other realms that may be a threat to this world.

16:50.320 --> 16:54.030
你的领养弟弟  洛基  就是其中之一
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.740
的确该加上他
He's a worthy inclusion.

16:58.660 --> 17:00.450
为什么带他来这儿
Then why bring him here?

17:00.580 --> 17:01.870
我们在找我父亲
We're looking for my father.

17:02.450 --> 17:05.540
那么  如果我告诉你奥丁在哪
So, if I were to tell you where Odin was,

17:05.830 --> 17:08.210
所有相关人士都会马上回阿斯加德吗
all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?

17:08.210 --> 17:09.210
是的  马上
Promptly.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.130
太好了  我来帮你吧
Great! Then I'll help you.

17:11.340 --> 17:13.630
如果你知道他在哪  为什么不联系我
If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me?

17:14.010 --> 17:16.300
我得告诉你  他坚持不许人打搅他
I have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.260
你父亲说他选择继续被流放
Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.600
而且你没有电话
And you don't have a phone.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.730
是啊  我没有电话
No, I don't have a phone,

17:24.730 --> 17:25.770
但你可以发个
but you could have sent

17:25.770 --> 17:27.650
电子信件  叫电邮
an electronic letter. It's called an email.

17:27.650 --> 17:30.020
-嗯  你有电脑吗  -没有  干吗用
- Yeah, do you have a computer? - No. What for?

17:30.980 --> 17:33.610
总之  我父亲不再被流放了
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.

17:33.610 --> 17:36.530
麻烦你告诉我他在哪  我就能带他回家了
So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home.

17:36.530 --> 17:38.700
没问题  他在挪威
Gladly. He's in Norway.

17:39.530 --> 17:40.700
我就是查看一下
I'm just seeing

17:40.700 --> 17:45.120
这则咒语是否要为阿斯加德人做些调整
whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.

17:45.750 --> 17:46.420
不用
Nope.

17:47.580 --> 17:48.750
我们不需要那个
We don't need that.

17:54.510 --> 17:56.590
你能不能别那么做了
Will you stop doing that?

17:57.300 --> 18:00.930
我可以...我需要你一根头发
Can I... I need just one strand of your hair.

18:00.930 --> 18:03.970
我告诉你  我的头发是碰不得的
Let me explain something. My hair is not to be meddled with.

18:12.570 --> 18:13.730
我们完全可以用走的
We could have just walked.

他在等你了
He's waiting for you.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.320
好
All right.

18:30.630 --> 18:31.540
抱歉
Sorry.

18:34.050 --> 18:35.210
来了
There we go.

18:36.670 --> 18:38.470
我还得要回我弟弟
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.300
对了  好的
Yeah. Right.

18:46.180 --> 18:49.640
我都下落30分钟了
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

18:50.270 --> 18:51.810
他就交给你了
You can handle him from here.

18:52.020 --> 18:54.900
好的  非常感谢你帮忙
Yes. Of course. Thank you very much for your help.

18:54.940 --> 18:55.570
祝你好运
Good luck.

18:55.570 --> 18:57.650
"交给你"  你是谁
Handle me? Who are you?

18:58.990 --> 18:59.570
洛基
Loki.

18:59.570 --> 19:01.160
你是什么术士吗
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

19:01.160 --> 19:02.700
你个二流货  别以为你...
Don't think for one minute, you second-rate...

19:02.700 --> 19:03.910
好吧  再见
All right. Bye-bye.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.230
父亲
Father?

19:32.230 --> 19:34.560
看看这里  多美
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

19:40.110 --> 19:41.280
父亲  是我们
Father, it's us.

我的儿子们
My sons.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.040
我一直在等你们
I've been waiting for you.

19:49.370 --> 19:50.960
我知道  我们来接你回家了
I know. We've come to take you home.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.750
回家  是啊
Home, yes.

19:54.630 --> 19:57.000
你们母亲  她在召唤我
Your mother, she calls me.

19:59.420 --> 20:00.380
你们听到了吗
Do you hear it?

20:02.260 --> 20:03.680
洛基  解除你的魔法
Loki, lift your magic.

20:06.430 --> 20:08.810
我花了好久才摆脱你的咒语
Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.

20:09.270 --> 20:10.770
弗丽嘉会为你自豪的
Frigga would have been proud.

20:11.140 --> 20:13.100
过来陪我坐下  我没多少时间了
Come and sit with me. I don't have much time.

20:20.190 --> 20:21.650
我知道我们辜负了你
I know we failed you.

20:21.650 --> 20:23.240
但我们可以弥补的
But we can make this right.

20:24.030 --> 20:25.030
是我辜负了你们
I failed you.

20:26.070 --> 20:29.080
诸神黄昏已经到来
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.000
不  我阻止了诸神黄昏  我了结了苏尔特尔
No, I've stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur.

20:32.580 --> 20:33.250
不
No.

20:34.210 --> 20:35.880
已经开始了  她要来了
It has already begun. She's coming.

20:37.420 --> 20:39.130
我的生命是唯一遏制着她的东西
My life was all that held her back.

20:39.130 --> 20:41.090
但我大限将至
But my time has come.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.470
我无法再抵住她了
I cannot keep her away any longer.

20:45.470 --> 20:47.300
父亲  你在说谁
Father, who are you talking about?

20:48.050 --> 20:50.720
死亡女神  海拉
Goddess of Death. Hela.

20:51.890 --> 20:52.980
我的长女
My firstborn.

20:54.640 --> 20:55.600
你姐姐
Your sister.

20:58.860 --> 20:59.770
什么
Your what?

21:02.900 --> 21:05.860
她的暴力欲望膨胀到我无法控制
Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.

21:06.910 --> 21:11.330
我无法阻止她  就囚禁了她  把她关了起来
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away.

21:12.410 --> 21:14.790
她从阿斯加德汲取力量
She draws her strength from Asgard,

21:14.790 --> 21:20.710
等她到了那里  她的力量就将无可限量
and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.130
不管她是什么  我们可以一同阻止她
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.

21:23.130 --> 21:23.670
我们可以一同对抗她
We can face her together.

21:23.670 --> 21:24.720
不行的
No, we won't.

21:25.590 --> 21:27.180
我已走上了另一条路
I'm on a different path now.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.430
这件事你们得独自面对了
This you must face alone.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.520
我爱你们  我的儿子
I love you, my sons.

21:36.020 --> 21:36.940
看啊
Look at that.

21:41.570 --> 21:43.030
记住这地方
Remember this place.

21:44.780 --> 21:45.530
家园
Home.

22:26.030 --> 22:26.780
哥哥
Brother.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.370
这都怪你
This was your doing.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.170
他死了啊
So he's gone.

23:25.130 --> 23:27.170
真可惜  我还挺想看到那一幕的
That's a shame. I would've liked to have seen that.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.260
你就是海拉吧
You must be Hela.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.760
我是托尔  奥丁之子
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

23:32.970 --> 23:36.010
是吗  你长得不像他
Really? You don't look like him.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.140
或许我们可以商量一下
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

23:38.140 --> 23:40.020
你口气像他
You sound like him.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.230
跪下
Kneel.

23:43.650 --> 23:44.690
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

23:49.400 --> 23:50.360
跪下
Kneel.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.490
拜见你的女王
Before your queen.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.120
别指望了
I don't think so.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.840
不可能
It's not possible.

24:12.340 --> 24:16.010
亲爱的  你根本想象不到我都能做什么
Darling, you have no idea what's possible.

24:36.070 --> 24:37.370
带我们回去
Bring us back!

24:37.370 --> 24:38.160
不
No!

24:47.630 --> 24:48.500
洛基

25:35.550 --> 25:37.550
你是谁  你把托尔怎么了
Who are you? What have you done with Thor?

25:42.560 --> 25:43.600
我是海拉
I'm Hela.

25:45.770 --> 25:47.100
我就是个扫地的
I'm just a janitor.

25:48.900 --> 25:52.730
你看上去像个求生本能强烈的机灵鬼
You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.

25:55.070 --> 25:56.740
想要份工作吗
How would you like a job?

28:08.330 --> 28:09.450
你是个战士吗
Are you a fighter?

28:10.540 --> 28:11.710
还是食物
Or are you food?

28:12.540 --> 28:13.960
我就是路过
I'm just passing through.

28:14.710 --> 28:16.130
是食物
It is food.

28:16.130 --> 28:17.380
跪下
On your knees.

29:00.250 --> 29:01.170
他是我的
He's mine.

29:10.890 --> 29:11.720
等等
Wait!

29:20.820 --> 29:21.690
等等
Wait!

29:24.280 --> 29:25.280
他是我的
He's mine.

29:25.360 --> 29:28.740
如果你们想要他  得过我这关
So if you want him, you go through me.

29:28.870 --> 29:30.580
但我们已经得到他了
But we've already got him.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.960
那好吧  我就先过你们这关
All right, then. I guess I go through you.

29:35.420 --> 29:36.540
又来食物了
More food.

30:12.700 --> 30:13.540
谢谢
Thank you.

30:48.650 --> 30:52.120
拾荒者142号  我需要进门并觐见老大
Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.

30:52.660 --> 30:54.450
我带来了特别的东西
I've got something special.

30:55.660 --> 30:56.950
你要带我去哪
Where are you taking me?

30:58.710 --> 31:00.000
回答我
Answer me!

31:01.420 --> 31:04.840
我是托尔  奥丁之子  我得回阿斯加德
I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.050
非常抱歉  王子殿下
Many apologies, your majesty.

31:35.950 --> 31:39.120
我发现  你们并不认识我
It's come to my attention that you don't know who I am.

31:46.590 --> 31:50.220
我是海拉  奥丁的长女
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,

31:50.380 --> 31:52.930
阿斯加德大军的统帅
the commander of the Legions of Asgard,

31:52.970 --> 31:56.560
王位的合法继承人  死亡女神
the rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death.

32:00.980 --> 32:02.850
我父亲已死
My father is dead.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.360
两位王子也是  不客气
As are the princes. You're welcome.

32:06.190 --> 32:09.650
我们曾在宇宙中坐拥无上力量
We were once the seat of absolute power in the cosmos.

32:09.650 --> 32:11.860
我们的地位无可匹及
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

32:11.860 --> 32:15.240
但奥丁却止步于九大王国
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

32:15.410 --> 32:19.120
我们的命运是统治所有其他王国
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

32:19.580 --> 32:23.080
我是来恢复那份权势的
And I am here to restore that power.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.790
给我跪下
Kneel before me

32:25.880 --> 32:29.800
加入我  与我一起踏上伟大的征途
and rise into the ranks of my great conquest.

32:31.420 --> 32:32.970
不管你是谁
Whoever you are,

32:33.300 --> 32:36.510
不管你做了什么  马上投降
whatever you've done, surrender now!

32:36.510 --> 32:38.680
否则我们绝不留情
Or we will show you no mercy.

32:38.680 --> 32:42.980
不管我是谁  我刚刚说话你听没听啊
Whoever I am? Did you listen to a word I said?

32:43.310 --> 32:45.230
这是你最后的警告
This is your last warning!

32:47.440 --> 32:49.650
我以为你们会乐意见到我呢
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

32:55.320 --> 32:56.200
好吧
Fine.

33:09.880 --> 33:12.210
进攻
Charge!

34:05.560 --> 34:07.560
我真怀念这个
I've missed this.

34:07.850 --> 34:09.650
不过  真是可惜
Still, it's a shame.

34:10.110 --> 34:12.320
好战士白白枉死
Good soldiers dying for nothing,

34:12.320 --> 34:14.570
就因为他们看不到未来
all because they couldn't see the future.

34:15.070 --> 34:16.240
悲哀
Sad.

34:18.030 --> 34:19.410
看  他还活着
Look, still alive.

34:27.210 --> 34:28.420
改主意了吗
Change of heart?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.090
滚回你爬出来的山洞去吧
Go back to whatever cave you crept out of.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.460
你个女魔头
You evil demoness!

34:38.260 --> 34:40.220
去看看我的王宫吧
Let's go see my palace.

35:11.170 --> 35:13.040
别担心  你已被找到
Fear not, for you are found.

35:15.550 --> 35:17.880
你到家了  再也回不去了
You are home, and there is no going back.

35:20.130 --> 35:21.930
没人能离开此地
No one leaves this place.

35:22.470 --> 35:23.890
但这里是什么地方
But what is this place?

35:24.890 --> 35:28.100
这里是  萨卡
The answer is Sakaar.

35:29.890 --> 35:32.150
被宇宙传送门环绕
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,

35:32.150 --> 35:35.230
萨卡位于已知和未知世界的边缘
Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.

35:35.230 --> 35:39.070
这里收集了所有迷失  不被爱的东西
It is the collection point for all lost and unloved things.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.400
比如你
Like you.

35:40.950 --> 35:43.740
但在萨卡  你是重要的
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.

35:43.870 --> 35:45.080
你是有价值的
You are valuable.

35:45.330 --> 35:47.120
你是被爱的
Here you are loved.

35:47.290 --> 35:48.160
怎么回事
What the hell?

35:48.160 --> 35:50.960
没人比宗师更爱你了
And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.

35:51.750 --> 35:55.710
他是最初的  第一个迷失  第一个被找到的人
He is the original, the first lost and the first found.

35:56.090 --> 35:57.340
萨卡的创始人
The creator of Sakaar,

35:57.340 --> 35:59.800
冠军格斗之父
and father of the Contest of Champions.

36:00.550 --> 36:04.220
虽然你曾经一文不名  但现在你有了身份
Where once you were nothing, now you are something.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.470
你是宗师的财产
You are the property of the Grandmaster.

36:08.220 --> 36:09.810
恭喜
Congratulations!

36:10.100 --> 36:13.190
你将在5秒后见到宗师

36:17.070 --> 36:18.320
准备好
Prepare yourself.

36:20.030 --> 36:23.200
你将见到宗师
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.

36:36.130 --> 36:38.250
他真棒  是个"他"吧
He's wonderful. It is a he?

36:38.550 --> 36:39.590
是的
It is a he.

36:40.090 --> 36:40.800
嗯
Yeah.

36:40.840 --> 36:43.130
我就喜欢你过来  142
I love when you come to visit, 142.

36:43.130 --> 36:44.970
你总给我带最好的东西来
You bring me the best stuff.

36:44.970 --> 36:48.680
托佩兹  每次我们聊起拾荒者142号
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142,

36:48.680 --> 36:52.430
我都怎么说  "她是..."  B开头的词
what do I always say? "She is the..." And it starts with a "B."

36:52.430 --> 36:53.480
垃圾
Trash.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.440
不  不是垃圾
No, not trash.

36:56.940 --> 36:58.520
你是就等着那么说她吗
Were you waiting just to call her that?

36:58.520 --> 36:59.980
都不是B开头的词
It doesn't start with a "B."

37:00.280 --> 37:01.320
酒鬼婆娘
Booze hag.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.280
抱歉  不是  "最好的"
I'm so sorry. No, "Best."

37:05.280 --> 37:06.700
我是想说"最好的"
I was thinking about "Best."

37:06.700 --> 37:08.030
因为我总说你是最好的
'Cause I always say you're the best.

37:08.030 --> 37:09.950
她为我带来了我的格斗冠军呢
She brought me my beloved champion, you know.

37:09.950 --> 37:11.910
每次她来你都这么说
You say that every time she's here.

37:11.910 --> 37:13.620
你今天带来的是什么  告诉我
What have you brought today? Tell me.

37:13.790 --> 37:14.790
参赛者
A contender.

37:14.790 --> 37:15.670
什么
A what?

37:15.920 --> 37:18.170
我得凑近点  我要凑近看看他
I need to go closer. I want to get a closer look at this.

37:18.170 --> 37:20.090
可以把我往前推推吗  谢谢
Can you take us closer? Thank you.

37:33.020 --> 37:33.730
给她钱
Pay this lady.

37:33.730 --> 37:35.850
给我等一下
Just wait a damn minute.

37:35.850 --> 37:38.310
我可不是卖品
I'm not for sale.

37:44.070 --> 37:46.200
天呐  他挺有斗志
Man, he's a fighter.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.490
我要一千万
I take 10 million.

37:47.490 --> 37:48.740
告诉她那是做梦
Tell her she's dreaming.

37:48.740 --> 37:51.160
老天  给她钱吧
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.710
你会付出代价的
You'll pay for this.

37:59.710 --> 38:01.500
不  是别人付我钱
No, I got paid for this.

38:03.050 --> 38:04.550
我想知道的是
Here's what I wanna know.

38:06.220 --> 38:07.090
你是谁
Who are you?

38:07.090 --> 38:12.390
我是雷神
I am the God of Thunder.

38:14.810 --> 38:15.560
我没听到雷声
I didn't hear any thunder,

38:15.560 --> 38:18.440
但你手上的是电火花吗
but out of your fingers, was that sparkles?

38:18.690 --> 38:20.360
我们找到你表亲了
We've located your cousin.

38:21.690 --> 38:22.480
太好了
Good!

38:22.820 --> 38:24.860
来吧  你会喜欢这个的
Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna like this.

38:24.860 --> 38:25.900
他在这儿呢
There he is.

38:26.150 --> 38:27.150
表弟
Hey, cuz.

38:27.950 --> 38:30.320
我们差点没找到你  你藏起来了吗
We almost couldn't find you. What, you been hiding?

38:32.910 --> 38:33.580
那么
So...

38:34.620 --> 38:35.410
求你

38:37.040 --> 38:37.870
对不起
I'm sorry.

38:37.960 --> 38:38.620
嗯
Yeah.

38:39.380 --> 38:40.170
卡洛
Carlo...

38:42.000 --> 38:42.920
我赦免你
I pardon you.

38:42.920 --> 38:43.880
谢谢
Thank you.

38:45.050 --> 38:45.710
谢谢
Thank you.

38:45.970 --> 38:47.340
你被赦免了
You're officially pardoned.

38:48.220 --> 38:49.260
免了生命
From life.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.060
救命
Help me.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.310
天呐
Oh, my God!

38:59.310 --> 39:01.730
流到我脚下了  看啊
I'm stepping in it. I'm stepping in it. Look!

39:03.980 --> 39:05.610
好臭
The smell.

39:06.030 --> 39:07.110
这是什么味儿
What does it smell like?

39:07.110 --> 39:08.360
烤焦的吐司
Burnt toast.

39:09.530 --> 39:10.990
我怎么这么没礼貌
What happened to my manners?

39:11.570 --> 39:13.280
我还没好好自我介绍呢
I haven't properly introduced myself.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.290
来吧  跟我来
Come on. Follow me.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.120
我叫宗师
My name is Grandmaster.

39:17.750 --> 39:18.660
我主持一项
I preside over a little

39:18.660 --> 39:21.330
滑稽表演  叫做冠军格斗
harlequinade called the Contest of Champions.

39:21.330 --> 39:24.300
来自各处的人  都会不情愿地参与其中
People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it.

39:24.300 --> 39:27.170
而你  我的朋友  可以加入新卡司
And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast.

39:27.170 --> 39:28.090
怎么样
What do you say to that?

39:28.090 --> 39:30.340
我们不是朋友  我也不在乎你的游戏
We're not friends and I don't give a shit about your games.

39:30.340 --> 39:32.090
我要回阿斯加德
I'm going back to Asgard.

39:32.090 --> 39:33.300
阿屎加德
Ass-gard.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.930
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four.

39:38.350 --> 39:40.770
我下方有个时间空间的虫洞
There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.

39:40.770 --> 39:43.770
于是  我放手了
At that moment, I let go.

39:44.150 --> 39:44.900
洛基
Loki?

39:46.570 --> 39:48.190
洛基
Loki! Loki!

39:48.400 --> 39:50.450
过来
Over here. Over here.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.490
-失陪一下  -洛基
- Excuse me one second. - Loki!

39:55.280 --> 39:56.370
-干什么  -你还活着
- What? - You're alive?

39:56.370 --> 39:58.410
-我当然还活着  -你怎么来了
- Yes, of course I'm alive. - What are you doing here?

39:58.410 --> 39:59.080
这话什么意思
What do you mean, what am I doing?

39:59.080 --> 40:00.660
我被困在这张破椅子上了
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.210
-你怎么没坐椅子  -没人让我坐椅子
- Where's your chair? - I didn't get a chair.

40:02.210 --> 40:03.500
-帮我从这椅子上起来  -不行
- Get me out of this one. - I can't.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.670
-帮我起来  -不行
- Get me out. - I can't.

40:04.670 --> 40:05.340
什么
What?

40:05.420 --> 40:06.920
我跟那个宗师交了朋友
I've made friends with this man. He's called the Grandmaster.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.840
-他是个疯子  -我赢得了他的好感
- He's crazy! - I've gained his favor.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.470
彩虹桥几周前把我丢到了这里
The Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago.

40:10.470 --> 40:11.590
-几周前  -是啊
- Weeks ago? - Yes.

40:11.590 --> 40:12.760
我才刚到
I just got here.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.090
你们在小声说什么呢
What are you whispering about?

40:14.970 --> 40:17.060
这里的时间规律很不一样
Time works real different around these parts.

40:17.060 --> 40:20.180
在别的世界上  我都该几百万岁了
On any other world, I'd be, like, millions of years old.

40:20.180 --> 40:21.350
但在萨卡上
But here on Sakaar...

40:27.230 --> 40:30.280
不管怎样  你认识这个...
In any case, you know this...

40:30.280 --> 40:31.530
你称自己为雷王是吧
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

40:31.530 --> 40:34.030
雷神  告诉他
God of Thunder. Tell him.

40:34.110 --> 40:35.990
我这辈子从未见过这个人
I've never met this man in my life.

40:35.990 --> 40:37.700
-他是我弟弟  -领养的
- He's my brother. - Adopted.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.080
他能不能打
Is he any kind of a fighter?

40:39.410 --> 40:41.000
你把我脖子上的东西拿走  我就打给你看看
You take this thing out of my neck and I'll show you.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.080
瞧瞧  他在威胁我呢
Now, listen to that. He's threatening me.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.960
小火花  事情是这样的
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.540
如果你想回到那个二死堡还是什么的地方
If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...

40:47.540 --> 40:48.590
阿斯加德
Asgard.

40:48.590 --> 40:51.760
任何参赛者  只要能打败我的冠军
Any contender who defeats my champion,

40:51.760 --> 40:53.970
就能赢得自由
their freedom they shall win.

40:53.970 --> 40:55.430
好啊  那就给我指个路
Fine. Then point me in the direction

40:55.430 --> 40:57.180
要我去揍的人在哪里
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

40:57.180 --> 40:59.890
这才是我的参赛者
That's what I call, contender.

40:59.890 --> 41:02.480
这边走  大王
Direction would be this way, Lord.

41:03.310 --> 41:04.140
洛基
Loki!

41:10.820 --> 41:12.240
放松点  哥们
Take it easy, man.

41:13.610 --> 41:14.410
这边呢
Over here.

41:14.410 --> 41:16.530
向你招手的一堆石头
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

41:16.530 --> 41:18.870
是的  我其实是有生命的
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.

41:18.870 --> 41:20.160
请允许我做个自我介绍
Allow me to introduce myself.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.620
我叫寇格  我算是这里的领导吧
My name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here.

41:22.620 --> 41:24.330
你也能看出来  我是石头做的
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.

41:24.330 --> 41:26.210
但不要被我的外表吓到
But don't let that intimidate you.

41:26.210 --> 41:28.750
你不用害怕  除非你是剪刀做的
You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors.

41:29.130 --> 41:31.460
就是跟你开个石头剪刀布的小玩笑
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.

41:31.840 --> 41:34.630
这是我的好朋友  米克
This is my very good friend over here, Miek.

41:34.630 --> 41:37.140
他是只有剪刀手的昆虫
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

41:38.180 --> 41:39.560
你是克努南人  对吗
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

41:39.560 --> 41:41.890
-没错  -你怎么会落到这里
- That I am. - How'd you end up in here?

41:42.470 --> 41:44.230
我试图发动革命来着
Well, I tried to start a revolution,

41:44.230 --> 41:45.770
但没做好宣传工作
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

41:45.770 --> 41:47.400
所以几乎没人参加
So hardly anyone turned up,

41:47.400 --> 41:49.730
除了我妈妈和她那讨厌的男朋友
except for my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.

41:49.730 --> 41:53.360
作为惩罚  我被迫来到这里做个角斗士
As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.360
简直是个宣传灾难
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

41:55.360 --> 41:58.410
但我其实在策划另一场革命
But I'm actually organizing another revolution.

41:58.410 --> 42:00.410
我不知道你是不是感兴趣
I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that.

42:00.410 --> 42:01.910
你觉得怎么样
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

42:04.410 --> 42:05.750
你怎么会...
How did you...

42:05.830 --> 42:08.460
是啊  这个地方其实是个圈
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.

42:08.670 --> 42:11.710
但不是真正的圈  更像是个恐怖怪圈
But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.130
这没道理
This doesn't make any sense.

42:13.130 --> 42:14.760
是啊  这里就是不讲道理的
No, nothing makes sense here, man.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.970
没道理就是这里的道理
The only thing that does make sense is that nothing makes sense.

42:17.970 --> 42:20.470
这里有人跟宗师的冠军打过吗
Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's champion?

42:20.470 --> 42:21.600
道格打过
Doug has.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.430
道格
Doug!

42:22.760 --> 42:24.220
这就是命  道格已经死了
Our luck, Doug's dead.

42:24.220 --> 42:27.730
对了  跟宗师的冠军打过的人都死掉了
That's right. Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

42:27.730 --> 42:29.480
你呢  你是石头做的
What about you? You're made of rocks.

42:29.690 --> 42:32.520
会死掉的石头  看啊  又掉一块
Perishable rock. There you go. Another one gone.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.280
我只是小打小闹
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,

42:34.280 --> 42:36.030
暖暖场之类的
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

42:36.530 --> 42:38.320
等等  你不是要去跟他打吧
Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?

42:38.320 --> 42:39.360
没错
Yes, I am.

42:40.070 --> 42:43.450
我要跟他打  打赢他  然后离开这鬼地方
Gonna fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place.

42:43.870 --> 42:45.830
道格以前就这么说
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.710
回见  新道格
See you later, new Doug.

42:57.590 --> 42:59.470
没人记得我吗
Does no one remember me?

43:00.010 --> 43:02.300
没人学过我们的历史吗
Has no one been taught our history?

43:07.810 --> 43:09.690
看看这些谎言
Look at these lies.

43:10.230 --> 43:12.440
高脚杯  花园聚会
Goblets and garden parties?

43:14.020 --> 43:15.400
和平协议
Peace treaties?

43:16.440 --> 43:17.280
奥丁...
Odin...

43:17.780 --> 43:19.150
为成果骄傲
Proud to have it,

43:19.610 --> 43:21.410
却觉得手段可耻
ashamed of how he got it.

43:40.220 --> 43:42.010
我们曾势不可挡
We were unstoppable.

43:42.640 --> 43:46.810
在扩张阿斯加德帝国时  我曾是他的武器
I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard's empire.

43:49.980 --> 43:53.230
我们征服了一个又一个王国
One by one, the realms became ours.

43:53.480 --> 43:57.860
然后  就因为我的野心比他更大
But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his,

43:57.990 --> 44:00.320
他就将我放逐  囚禁
he banished me, caged me,

44:00.320 --> 44:02.490
像只野兽一样把我锁了起来
locked me away like an animal.

44:02.860 --> 44:05.780
在那之前  阿斯加德的战士是受尊敬的
Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored,

44:05.780 --> 44:09.290
他们的遗体像英雄那样葬在这宫殿下面
their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.

44:20.760 --> 44:23.050
-奥丁的宝藏  -赝品
- Odin's treasures. - Fake.

44:24.550 --> 44:26.760
这里大部分的东西都是赝品
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

44:27.720 --> 44:28.680
或者没用
Or weak.

44:30.890 --> 44:32.600
比我以为的要小
Smaller than I thought it would be.

44:34.150 --> 44:35.400
这个还可以
That's not bad.

44:36.190 --> 44:37.230
但是这个...
But this...

44:37.860 --> 44:40.110
永恒烈火
The Eternal Flame.

45:08.140 --> 45:10.850
想看看真正的力量是什么样子吗
Want to see what true power really looks like?

45:39.420 --> 45:42.090
亲爱的芬里斯  他们对你做了什么
Fenris, my darling, what have they done to you?

45:44.670 --> 45:49.050
永恒烈火将让你们重生
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

46:04.240 --> 46:05.780
我好想你
I've missed you.

46:06.950 --> 46:08.320
我想念你们大家
I've missed you all.

46:11.540 --> 46:12.240
奥丁
Odin,

46:12.830 --> 46:16.040
我愿你升入英灵殿
I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla,

46:16.290 --> 46:18.290
勇者将在那里永生
where the brave shall live forever.

46:20.210 --> 46:22.420
我们应该高兴而不是哀伤
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,

46:22.840 --> 46:25.720
因为他们死得光荣
for those that have died the glorious death.

46:33.640 --> 46:34.680
扎心  对吗
Hurts, doesn't it?

46:35.350 --> 46:36.270
被欺骗的感觉
Being lied to.

46:37.270 --> 46:40.810
告诉你是一回事  然后你发现那都是假的
Being told you're one thing and then learning it's all a fiction.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.240
你不会以为我真的会来这里见你吧
You didn't think I'd really come and see you, did you?

46:47.240 --> 46:48.820
这地方太恶心了
This place is disgusting.

46:52.200 --> 46:53.990
你是不想要我帮忙吗
Does this mean you don't want my help?

46:53.990 --> 46:56.290
我不能失去我在宗师身边的地位
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with the Grandmaster.

46:56.290 --> 46:57.790
我为赢得他的信任很费心力
It took me time to win his trust.

46:57.790 --> 46:59.370
他是个疯子  但也是有办法应付的
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

46:59.370 --> 47:00.710
我是想告诉你
What I'm telling you is,

47:00.710 --> 47:02.750
你可以跟我一起服侍宗师
you could join me at the Grandmaster's side.

47:02.750 --> 47:07.550
也许将来  宗师会出事  然后...
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...

47:13.640 --> 47:16.100
你不是真在考虑回去吧
You're not seriously thinking of going back, are you?

47:18.480 --> 47:22.650
我们姐姐像砸玻璃一样轻松毁了你的锤子
Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.320
她比我们都强  她比你强
She's stronger than both of us. She's stronger than you.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.690
你一丝机会都没有
You don't stand a chance.

47:26.860 --> 47:28.740
你明白我什么意思吗
Do you understand what I'm saying here?

47:33.660 --> 47:34.370
好吧
Fine.

47:37.330 --> 47:39.370
那我得单干了
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

47:40.920 --> 47:42.210
一如既往
Like I've always done.

47:44.840 --> 47:45.840
你能不能说点什么
Would you say something?

47:48.760 --> 47:49.800
说话啊
Say something!

47:51.470 --> 47:52.840
你要我说什么
What would you like me to say?

47:54.050 --> 47:55.850
你装死
You faked your own death,

47:56.390 --> 47:58.850
偷了王位  剥夺了奥丁的法力
you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power,

47:58.850 --> 48:02.440
把他留在地球上等死  放出了死亡女神
stranded him on Earth to die, releasing the Goddess of Death.

48:02.440 --> 48:03.270
这些够不够
Have I said enough

48:03.270 --> 48:06.190
还是你要我继续翻两天之前的旧账
or would you like me to go back further than the past two days?

48:07.650 --> 48:11.490
我还没见过他口中这个宠儿冠军
You know, I haven't seen this beloved champion he talks of,

48:11.570 --> 48:13.910
但听说他野蛮得吓人
but I've heard he is astonishingly savage.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.700
明天的格斗  我下了很大的注压你输
I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow.

48:18.290 --> 48:19.330
别让我失望
Don't let me down.

48:23.120 --> 48:24.500
滚开  鬼
Piss off, ghost!

48:27.170 --> 48:28.300
他消失了
He's freaking gone.

48:37.640 --> 48:38.310
恶心
Yuck!

48:38.310 --> 48:40.560
这上面还留着不知谁的毛发和血
There's still someone's hair and blood all over this.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.520
伙计们  格斗完能不能清理下武器啊
Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight?

48:43.520 --> 48:45.150
恶心的懒蛋
Disgusting slobs.

48:46.110 --> 48:49.110
托尔  用大木叉子吗
Thor, wanna use a big wooden fork?

48:50.190 --> 48:50.780
不了
No.

48:50.780 --> 48:52.110
是啊  不太实用
Yeah, not really useful.

48:52.110 --> 48:54.200
除非你要打挤成一团的
Unless you're fighting off three vampires

48:54.200 --> 48:55.660
三个吸血鬼
that were huddled together.

48:56.450 --> 48:58.200
真希望我的锤子还在
I really wish I had my hammer.

48:58.830 --> 48:59.410
锤子
Hammer?

48:59.410 --> 49:00.160
很特别
Quite unique.

49:00.160 --> 49:03.960
是用濒死星球内核的特别金属制成
It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.330
我快速抡它
And when I spun it really, really fast,

49:05.330 --> 49:06.880
就能飞起来
it gave me the ability to fly.

49:06.880 --> 49:08.000
你骑在锤子上
You rode a hammer?

49:08.250 --> 49:09.800
不  不是骑在上面
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

49:09.800 --> 49:11.010
它骑在你背上
The hammer rode you on your back?

49:11.010 --> 49:13.300
不  我快速抡它
No. I used to spin it really fast,

49:13.300 --> 49:14.840
它就会把我带起来...
and it would pull me off the...

49:14.840 --> 49:17.140
天啊  锤子给你撸吗
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?

49:17.140 --> 49:18.720
把我带离地面  它会带我离开地面
The ground. It would pull me off the ground,

49:18.720 --> 49:20.810
带我升入空中  我就能飞了
up into the air, and I would fly.

49:21.020 --> 49:24.100
我把它扔出去  它总能回到我手中
Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me.

49:24.100 --> 49:26.440
你和这把锤子的关系好像很特殊
Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship

49:26.440 --> 49:27.150
很亲密
with this hammer

49:27.150 --> 49:30.440
失去它堪比失去爱人
and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.

49:31.070 --> 49:32.360
这么说挺温馨的
That's a nice way of putting it.

49:35.070 --> 49:36.240
我说了这些是我的
I said they're mine.

49:37.740 --> 49:40.040
看  就是她把我抓来的
See her, that's the one that put me in here.

49:40.200 --> 49:42.080
是啊  拾荒者142号
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

49:42.080 --> 49:44.250
要小心这些阿斯加德人
Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.

49:44.290 --> 49:45.790
命硬得很
They are hard to perish.

49:46.250 --> 49:47.290
阿斯加德人
Asgardian?

49:53.510 --> 49:56.470
别用那玩意电我  我有话要说
Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.

49:57.720 --> 49:59.140
阿斯加德有危险了
Asgard is in danger.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.060
天啊  你是女武神
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

50:06.060 --> 50:08.230
我小时候还想当女武神
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger,

50:08.230 --> 50:10.730
但之后我发现你们都是女的
until I found out that you were all women.

50:10.730 --> 50:13.230
是女的没什么不好  我爱女人
There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women.

50:13.400 --> 50:14.780
有时太爱了
Sometimes a little too much.

50:15.030 --> 50:18.160
不是猥琐的那种  是尊重的欣赏
Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation.

50:18.160 --> 50:22.450
能有一支女武士组成的精英部队真的很不错
I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors.

50:22.830 --> 50:23.830
是时候了
It's about time.

50:26.080 --> 50:27.830
-你说完没  -雷王  该你了
- Are you done? - Lord of Thunder, you're up.

50:27.830 --> 50:29.420
求你  帮帮我  我需要你的帮助
Please, help me. I need your help.

50:29.420 --> 50:30.130
再见
Bye.

50:30.420 --> 50:32.380
好吧  那你不是叛徒就是懦夫
Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward.

50:32.380 --> 50:34.630
因为女武神都发过誓要保卫王权
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne.

50:35.760 --> 50:39.260
听仔细了  殿下  这是萨卡  不是阿斯加德
Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

50:39.260 --> 50:41.050
我是拾荒者  不是女武神
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.180
带他过来收拾一下
Bring him in for processing.

50:46.480 --> 50:50.560
没人能逃出这里  所以你反正也是个死
And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway.

51:02.160 --> 51:03.580
你别动
Now, don't you move.

51:03.740 --> 51:06.620
我的手不如以前稳了
My hands ain't as steady as they used to be.

51:06.790 --> 51:09.960
以奥丁的胡子起誓  你不准剪我的头发
By Odin's beard, you shall not cut my hair,

51:09.960 --> 51:12.920
不然就会尝到托尔之怒的滋味
lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.

51:16.840 --> 51:19.300
求你了  求你了  好心人  别剪我头发
Please. Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.

51:20.510 --> 51:21.930
求你  不要
Please! No!

51:22.140 --> 51:23.720
不
No!

51:36.400 --> 51:39.950
看看你们  今晚比赛多么精彩
Look at all of you. What a show! What a night!

51:39.950 --> 51:40.990
谁觉得开心
Who's having fun?

51:41.990 --> 51:43.990
我是你们的主持人
Please, I'm your host.

51:43.990 --> 51:47.370
请掌声感谢所有赛前战的格斗者
Big round of applause for all of our undercard competitors,

51:47.370 --> 51:50.620
他们今天死得真可怕
who today died so gruesomely.

51:50.620 --> 51:51.790
比赛真棒
Good sports.

51:51.960 --> 51:53.790
今晚比赛多么精彩
What a show! What a night!

51:54.460 --> 51:57.880
我们都是为格斗而来的
This is what you've come for, and so have I.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.930
现在  不再耽搁
And now, without further ado,

52:06.930 --> 52:08.890
压轴比赛开始了
it's main event time.

52:11.060 --> 52:14.480
虽是首次登场  但却很有潜力
Making his first appearance, though he looks quite promising,

52:14.560 --> 52:16.610
有点绝招
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.

52:16.900 --> 52:19.320
我不再多说了  你们来自己判断
I'll say no more, see what you think.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.450
女士们先生们  有请
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

52:22.280 --> 52:23.820
雷王
Lord of Thunder.

52:47.760 --> 52:49.890
小心他的手指  会放火花
Watch out for his fingers. They make sparks.

52:49.890 --> 52:51.600
好了  来吧
Okay, this is it.

52:51.730 --> 52:55.150
我们准备欢迎这家伙吧  他来咯
Let's get ready to welcome this guy. Here he comes.

53:03.360 --> 53:04.990
他这个家伙
He is a creature.

53:04.990 --> 53:06.740
我们要怎么说呢
What can we say about him?

53:06.740 --> 53:09.370
他很特别  独一无二
Well, he's unique. There's none like him.

53:09.370 --> 53:11.750
我觉得跟他有特别的感情
I feel a special connection with him.

53:13.540 --> 53:15.170
他从未有败绩
He's undefeated.

53:16.460 --> 53:17.630
是连胜者
He's the reigning.

53:20.380 --> 53:21.630
是卫冕方
He's the defending.

53:22.880 --> 53:24.090
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

53:24.220 --> 53:25.260
有请
I give you...

53:29.970 --> 53:34.270
无敌的
Your Incredible...

53:37.520 --> 53:39.820
绿巨人
Hulk!

53:40.150 --> 53:41.650
太好了
Yes!

53:45.280 --> 53:46.990
我得离开这个星球
I have to get off this planet.

53:48.950 --> 53:49.910
你想去哪啊
Where you going?

54:00.040 --> 54:01.340
我俩认识
We know each other.

54:01.670 --> 54:03.130
他是我战友
He's a friend from work.

54:12.810 --> 54:14.020
你去哪了
Where have you been?

54:14.350 --> 54:16.190
大家都以为你死了
Everybody thought you were dead.

54:16.270 --> 54:18.610
我们上次一别后发生了好多事
But so much has happened since I last saw you.

54:19.440 --> 54:20.610
我失去了锤子
I lost my hammer.

54:21.150 --> 54:24.030
就昨天  还记忆犹新的
Like, yesterday, so that's still pretty fresh.

54:24.320 --> 54:26.360
洛基还活着  相信吗
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?

54:26.360 --> 54:27.700
他就在上面
He's up there.

54:27.860 --> 54:29.870
洛基  看这是谁
Loki! Look who it is!

54:32.200 --> 54:34.540
班纳  真没想到我会这么说
Banner, I never thought I would say this,

54:34.540 --> 54:36.460
但我见到你可真高兴
but I'm happy to see you.

54:36.460 --> 54:38.830
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

54:45.670 --> 54:46.420
班纳
Banner.

54:47.550 --> 54:48.430
班纳
Banner!

54:49.180 --> 54:51.390
不是班纳  只有绿巨人
No Banner. Only Hulk.

54:51.640 --> 54:52.430
你在干什么
What are you doing?

54:53.010 --> 54:54.850
是我啊  托尔
It's me. It's Thor!

55:14.950 --> 55:16.290
班纳  我们是朋友啊
Banner, we're friends.

55:16.410 --> 55:18.210
这真是疯了  我不想伤你
This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

55:25.340 --> 55:27.510
这就对了  这才像话
Here we go. Here we go.

55:46.320 --> 55:47.030
什么
What?

55:58.080 --> 55:59.000
大块头
Hey, big guy.

56:01.120 --> 56:02.830
太阳快下山了
The sun's getting real low.

56:14.260 --> 56:16.100
没错  太阳要下山了
That's it. The sun's going down.

56:19.520 --> 56:20.890
我不会再伤害你了
I won't hurt you anymore.

56:21.770 --> 56:22.690
没人会伤害你了
No one will.

56:35.280 --> 56:36.120
没错
Yes!

56:36.160 --> 56:37.910
就是这感觉
That's how it feels!

56:38.370 --> 56:40.410
我就是太喜欢这项运动了
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

56:48.420 --> 56:50.210
好吧  不管了
All right. Screw it.

57:02.190 --> 57:03.520
我知道你还在的  班纳
I know you're in there, Banner.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.730
我会把你逼出来的
I'll get you out!

57:14.030 --> 57:15.780
你是怎么了  真让我下不来台
What's the matter with you? You're embarrassing me!

57:15.780 --> 57:17.660
我还跟他们说我们是朋友
I told them we were friends!

58:49.710 --> 58:53.170
雷哥  雷哥
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

58:53.170 --> 58:58.300
雷哥  雷哥
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

59:29.710 --> 59:31.830
又一天  又一个道格
Another day, another Doug.

59:41.300 --> 59:43.350
那是什么声音
What is that noise?

59:43.720 --> 59:46.680
民众并没有乖乖听话
The common folk aren't exactly falling in line.

59:46.720 --> 59:50.140
有抵抗者想撞倒大门
There's a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.

59:55.900 --> 59:57.690
说说你自己吧  斯科尔奇
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

59:58.030 --> 01:00:00.610
我爸是个石匠  我妈是...
Well, me dad was a stonemason. Me mum was...

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:04.530
嗯  打住吧  我的意思是
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there. What I meant was,

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:05.990
你的野心是什么
what's your ambition?

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:10.750
我只想要个机会证明自己
I just want a chance to prove myself.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.500
承认
Recognition.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.460
我年轻时
When I was young,

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.800
每位伟大国王都有个处刑人
every great king had an executioner.

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:20.340
不仅仅是进行处刑
Not just to execute people,

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.680
也执行国王的愿景
but also to execute their vision.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.930
但主要还是做处刑的
But mainly to execute people.

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:28.930
但  这仍是无上光荣
Still, it was a great honor.

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.270
我曾是奥丁的处刑人
I was Odin's executioner.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.150
你就做我的处刑人
And you shall be my executioner.

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:46.370
我们开始征程吧
Let's begin our conquest.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.590
斯科尔奇  剑呢
Skurge, where's the sword?

01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:08.430
那把剑是打开彩虹桥的钥匙
That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost.

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.430
你提到的那些人
Those people you mentioned,

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:12.440
那些不肯乖乖就范的
the ones who aren't falling into line...

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.270
把他们都抓起来
Round them up.

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.210
借过
Excuse me.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.850
抱歉了  那些玩意到处都是
Sorry about that. These bloody things are everywhere.

01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:56.480
走吧
Come on.

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:33.060
你们在这里是安全的
You'll be safe here.

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:44.170
我们没事了吧
Are we cool?

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.340
绿巨人洗热浴盆
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:52.340
你这样多久了
So how long have you been like that?

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:54.050
什么样
Like what?

01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:57.890
这样  大块头  绿色的  呆头呆脑
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.980
绿巨人一直是绿巨人
Hulk always Hulk.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.940
你怎么到这儿的
How'd you get here?

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:09.030
靠赢
Winning.

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:10.450
你是说作弊吧
You mean cheating?

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.950
你赢的时候  对手也都有这玩意吗
Were they wearing one of these when you won?

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:14.620
你怎么来到这儿的
How'd you arrive here?

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:18.580
昆式战斗机
Quinjet.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.830

你没穿衣服
That's naked.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.800
他没穿衣服

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.930
这下忘不掉了

不不  我的人民需要我回阿斯加德
No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard.

01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:05.750
我们得阻止诸神黄昏
We must prevent Ragnarok.

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:07.040
诸神黄昏
Ragnarok?

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.960
我家园的毁灭预言
The prophesied death of my home world.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.050
世界末日  一切终结
The end of days, it's the end of...

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:14.800
如果你帮我回阿斯加德
If you help me get back to Asgard,

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.760
我可以帮你回地球

01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:26.810

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.020

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.070
班纳的朋友
Banner's friend.

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:31.440

I don't even like Banner.

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:33.900
"我喜欢数字  科学什么的"
"I'm into numbers and science and stuff."

01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:36.490
托尔走  绿巨人留下

又是红  又是白  选个颜色吧  真荒唐
The red, the white. Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.130
砸扁你
Smash you.

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:50.550
你才没砸扁什么  那场角斗我赢了
You didn't smash anything. I won that fight.

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:53.010
-我砸扁了你  -好吧

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:54.800

自己来看吧
Come see for yourself.

01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:13.170
我在祖先建造的要塞里庇护大家
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold built by our ancestors.

01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:16.550
但如果抵挡不住  我们只能靠彩虹桥逃跑
But if the garrison falls, our only escape is Bifrost.

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:18.510
你想要疏散整个阿斯加德
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:23.430

01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:27.640
走吧

海拉很贪婪
Hela is ravenous.

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:34.820
如果我放走了她
If I let her leave,

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.110
她会吞噬整个九大王国甚至宇宙
she'll consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

我们需要你
We need you.

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:40.320
我在想办法了  但我都不知道自己在哪
I'm working on it. But I don't even know where the hell I am.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.030
你所在的星球周围都是传送门  穿过其中一个
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.

01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:44.830
-哪个  -大的那个

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.650
托尔难过
Thor sad.

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.870
我不难过  你个白痴
I'm not sad, you idiot.

01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:25.200
我在生气
I'm pissed off!

01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:29.750
愤怒  我失去了父亲

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.210
-唧唧歪歪  像个孩子  -你都没认真听
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby. - You're not even listening.

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:38.210
别踢东西
Don't kick stuff.

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.720
你真不够朋友
You're being a really bad friend.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.050
你才不够朋友
You bad friend!

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:44.010
-你知道我们怎么喊你吗  -不知道
- You know what we call you? - No.

01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:46.350
我们喊你蠢复仇者
We call you the stupid Avenger.

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:48.350
你是小复仇者
You're tiny Avenger!

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.270
你疯了吗
What, are you crazy?

01:08:52.270 --> 01:08:53.190

很抱歉我说了那些话
I'm sorry I said those things.

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:25.550
你不是蠢复仇者
You're not the stupid Avenger.

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:27.930
没人喊你蠢复仇者
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.600
没事
It's okay.

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.100
你不能随便冲人仍盾牌
You just can't go around throwing shields at people.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:32.810
差点杀了我
Could have killed me.

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:35.770
我知道  对不起  我总是好生气
I know. I'm sorry. I just get so angry all the time.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:37.980
绿巨人总是很生气
Hulk always, always angry.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.070
我知道  我们是一样的
I know. We're the same, you and I.

我们就是俩鲁莽的傻瓜
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:46.740
是啊  一样  绿巨人是火  托尔是水
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.

01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:49.410
我们都是火
We're kind of both like fire.

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:51.410
但绿巨人是真火
But Hulk like real fire.

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:54.960

怎么了  你...
What's going on? What are you...

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.120
你就蠢到看不出
You're so thick-headed that you can't tell

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.080
人家远远躲到了宇宙尽头
when someone's hiding all the way across the universe

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.290
就是不想被打扰吗
and wants to be left alone?

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:36.160
-我们得谈谈  -不  你想跟我谈
- We need to talk. - No, you wanna talk to me.

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:37.750
我需要她留下

这样吧
Here's the deal.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:55.270
我听你说
I'll listen to you

01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:58.020

阿斯加德有危险  人民在牺牲
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:03.730

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.450
喝完了  再见
Finished. Bye.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.320
奥丁死了
Odin is dead.

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.160
死亡女神海拉  入侵了阿斯加德
Hela, the Goddess of Death, has invaded Asgard.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:19.250
如果海拉回来了  那阿斯加德无望了
If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:20.830
我要阻止她
I'm going to stop her.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.840
-一个人吗  -不
- Alone? - Nope.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.460
我在组建一支队伍
I'm putting together a team.

01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:27.340
我  你还有大块头
It's me, you, and the big guy.

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:30.050
不  不组队  绿巨人单干
No. No team. Only Hulk.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.930
我和你
It's me and you.

01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:33.140

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:39.480
我不要再次
I'm not getting dragged

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.650
被卷入奥丁的家庭纠纷当中
into another one of Odin's family squabbles.

01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:43.400
-这话什么意思  -你姐姐
- What's that supposed to mean? - Your sister.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.480
她的力量来自阿斯加德  你也是
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.940
当奥丁无法控制她的力量
When it grew beyond Odin's control

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.490
她就屠杀了王宫里的每个人
she massacred everyone in the palace

01:11:48.490 --> 01:11:49.950
企图夺取王位
and tried to seize the throne.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.820
她企图逃离驱逐时
When she tried to escape her banishment

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.950
他派女武神去抵抗她
he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.200
我能生还只是因为
I only survived because...

01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:00.750
我已经迎战过她一次了
Look, I already faced her once

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.460
那是我还相信王权的时候
back when I believed in the throne,

01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:04.290
而我失去了一切
and it cost me everything.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.000
这就是阿斯加德的问题
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.760
王权  秘密  金色的骗局
The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.800
我同意
I agree.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.470
别太亲近了
Don't get familiar.

01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:14.010
我同意
I agree.

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.140
所以我拒绝了王位
That's why I turned down the throne.

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:19.180
但关键不在于王位  而是人民
But this isn't about the crown. This is about the people.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:21.560
他们要死了  他们也是你的人民
They're dying and they're your people, too.

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:22.480
忘了他们吧
Forget it.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:24.770
我就做到了
I have.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.440
-好吧  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.030

-谢什么  -这个
- For what? - For this.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.490
你没看到吧
Didn't see that, did you?

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:38.290
那么...这下好多了
There... That's better.

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:41.330
随你吧
You know, go ahead.

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:45.840
留下  为那个疯子奴役他人
Stay here and enslave people for that lunatic.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.630
继续喝酒  躲藏
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:48.630
但我
But me...

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:54.260
我会冲向我的麻烦  而不是逃避它们
I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them.

01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:56.470
因为...
Because that's what...

01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:03.230
因为  英雄都会这么做
Because that's what heroes do.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.660
朋友留下
Friend stay!

01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:29.380

我们不知道奥创要去哪
We don't know where Ultron's headed,

但你飞得很高很快

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.240
所以  你得驾驶飞机返航
So, I need you to turn this bird around, okay?

01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:40.870
隐匿模式追踪不到你
We can't track you in stealth mode,

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:43.790

就是如此
Well, it's true.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.130
看来那个诱拐犯
It seems that that criminally seductive

01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:01.970
雷王把他偷走了
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.

01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:04.760
是诱拐犯雷神  我们得走了
Seductive God of Thunder. We need to move.

01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:06.510
糟糕
Oh, no.

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.100

This is bad.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.520
这太糟糕了
This is really, really bad.

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:17.770
托尔  我在抓狂
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:19.360

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.610
别抓狂  你没事的  穿上这个

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.970
知道我怪谁吗
And you know who I'm blaming?

01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.020
宗师  我可以...
Grandmaster, I can...

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:52.600
别打断我
Don't interrupt me!

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.440
给你
Here you go.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.730
你干吗把融化棍递给我
Why are you handing me the melt stick?

01:17:56.730 --> 01:17:57.940
他打断了我
He was interrupting.

01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.980
那又不是死罪
That's not a capital violation.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.440
我说到哪了
Where was I?

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.110
我的宝贝冠军不见了
My precious champion has come up missing,

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.240
这都是因为那个雷王
and it's all because of that Lord of Thunder.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.700
都怪他
It's all because of him.

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:08.740
你哥哥
Your brother.

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:12.160
不管你们怎么回事  是领养还是另有隐情
Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated, or you know.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.250
我相信有很多渊源
I'm sure there's a big history.

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:14.580
他是你带来的参赛者
And your contender...

01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:16.000
亲爱的朋友
My dear friend,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.960
如果你能给我12小时
if you were to give me 12 hours,

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.710
我可以把他俩都活着带回来
I could bring them both back to you. Alive.

01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:21.000
我两小时就能做到
I could do it in two.

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:23.340
我一小时就能做到
I could do it in one.

01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:24.510
打住吧
Let's stop there.

01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:26.180
知道吗  我今早醒来时
You know what? I woke up this morning

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.010
想的是公开处决
thinking about a public execution.

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:31.470
但现在  我可以安于
But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little

01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:33.220
"谁能先抓到他"
"Who's gonna get him first?"

01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:36.690
所以  你们得抓紧了
So, you're on the clock.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:39.730
你做了什么
What have you done?

01:18:39.730 --> 01:18:41.230
我不听命于你  狗腿子
I don't answer to you, lackey.

01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:42.320
是洛基
It's Loki.

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.650
你要听命于宗师
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:50.160
你为什么要帮我哥哥和那个绿傻瓜逃跑
Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.870
我不帮任何人
I don't help anyone.

01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.710
你是个女武神
You're a Valkyrie.

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:06.970
我以为女武神都惨死了
I thought the Valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths.

01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:09.510
接下来要说什么想好了
Choose your next words wisely.

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:12.850
非常抱歉  那记忆一定很痛苦
I'm terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory.

01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:07.570
太阳快下山了  要下山了
The sun's going down. It's getting really low.

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:10.110
太阳快下山了  要下山了
The sun's going down. It's getting real low.

01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:11.490
该死
Oh, shoot.

01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:14.740
-太阳快下山了  -你能不能别念叨了
- Sun's getting low. - Would you stop saying that?

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:15.950
我就是需要你保持冷静
I just need you to stay calm.

01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:18.040
冷静  我在外星球上
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.910
反正就是个星球  星球你也是去过的
This is just a planet. You've been on a planet before.

01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:20.830
是啊  就一个
Yeah. One.

01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:22.830
现在你去过俩了  这是好事
Now you've been on two. That's a good thing.

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:24.380
-这是新体验  -天呐
- It's a new experience. - Oh, my God.

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:25.300
我的神经元
My neurons,

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:28.380
已经在超过我大脑信息处理速度地运作了
they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information.

01:20:28.670 --> 01:20:30.970
这次的感觉完全不一样
The whole thing is totally different this time.

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:32.050
以前  我一直觉得
In the past, I always felt

01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:34.550
我和绿巨人各有一只手把着方向盘
like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel.

01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:36.640
但这次  就好像他拿了车钥匙
But this time, it's like he had the keys to the car

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.270
而我被锁在后备箱里
and I was locked in the trunk.

01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:40.060
你现在回来了  这才最重要
All right, well, you're back now. That's all that matters.

01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:41.100
不  不是的
No, it's not what matters.

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:41.940
我就是想告诉你
What I'm trying to tell you,

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:44.150
如果我再变成绿巨人
is that if I turn into the Hulk again,

01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:45.690
班纳可能就再也回不来了
Banner may never come back.

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:49.320
而且我们还困在一颗一切都让我紧张的星球上
And we're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.110
我们没被困  我会想到办法回家的
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:53.450
谢谢
Thank you.

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:55.910
不是你家  我的家  阿斯加德
Not your home, though. Asgard. My home.

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:56.660
什么
What?

01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:59.330
听着  我的人民身陷危险
Listen, my people are in great danger.

01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:01.750
你和我  我们得去击退一个非常厉害的人
You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being,

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:03.120
碰巧她还是我姐姐
who also happens to be my sister.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.250
好吧  这太离谱了
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:07.960
我不想打你姐姐  这是家庭问题
I don't wanna fight your sister. That's a family issue.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.300
不  她是邪恶化身
No, she's an evil being.

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.220
我不管她怎么样
I don't care what she is.

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:13.800
我不要再打谁了  我受够了
I'm not fighting any more beings. I'm sick of it.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.090
-什么  -我刚跟你说了
- What? - I just told you.

01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:18.310
如果我再变成绿巨人  我会变不回来的
If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again.

01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:19.220
你都不在乎
And you don't care.

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:21.270
不不  我要组建一支队伍
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:22.560
绿巨人是火
The Hulk is the fire.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.690
等等  你是在利用我得到绿巨人
Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:25.400
-什么  -真过分
- What? - It's gross.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.190
什么  不是的
What? No!

01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:28.360
你才不在乎我呢  你不是我的朋友
You don't care about me. You're not my friend.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.570
才不是  我都不喜欢绿巨人  他就...
No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like...

01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:33.030
"砸扁  砸扁  砸扁"
"Smash, smash, smash."

01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:34.610
我更喜欢你
I prefer you.

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:36.370
谢谢
Thanks.

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:40.290
但老实说  在对抗邪恶化身这件事上
But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings,

01:21:40.290 --> 01:21:41.790
他是很强大很有帮助
he is very powerful and useful.

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:43.960
班纳也很强大很有帮助
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:44.580
是吗
Is he though?

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:47.130
好吧  绿巨人有几个博士学位  零
Okay. How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:49.340
班纳有多少个博士学位  七个
How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.

01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:52.260
好吧  你不用打任何人
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:54.130
但我们在这里有危险  我们得走了
But we're in danger here, so we have to move.

01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:58.970
你拿那个做什么
What are you doing with that?

01:21:58.970 --> 01:22:00.560
我需要伪装  我是逃犯
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.810
-我也需要伪装  -你就是伪装
- I need a disguise. - You are the disguise.

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.600
-我装成托尼·斯塔克  -什么
- I'll be Tony Stark. - What?

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.850
嗯  托尼和吉普赛人
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:09.360
不  你不是托尼  你是布鲁斯·班纳
No, no, you're not Tony. You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.820
那你为什么把我打扮成托尼
Then why did you dress me up like Tony?

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.070
因为你光着呢
Because you were naked.

01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:13.490
好吧  这是个好理由
Okay, I'll give you that.

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:15.240
你干什么呢  别乱抓了
What are you doing? Stop doing that!

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.740
托尼的裤子好紧
Tony wears his pants super tight.

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:17.950
-别抓了  -抱歉
- Stop it! - I'm sorry.

01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:20.240
-你为什么怪怪的  -我不知道
- Why are you being so weird? - I don't know.

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.870
或许我在一个怪物体内
Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:26.000
困了两年所以才怪怪的
inside of a monster made me a little weird.

01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:27.420
没事的
It's okay.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.920
你没事的  冷静下来  走吧
You're good. Calm down. Calm down. Come on.

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.630
我们去阿斯加德
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard

01:22:31.630 --> 01:22:33.840
你再也不用去想绿巨人了
and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.010
-好吗  -好
- All right? - All right.

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:42.310
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.180
这可太糟了
This is bad.

01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:50.270
班纳  班纳
Banner! Banner!

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:54.690
班纳
Banner!

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:09.670
班纳
Banner!

01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:11.420
托尔
Thor!

01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:26.310
我正打算那么做呢
I was gonna do that.

01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:27.810
我先做了
Yeah, well, I did it first.

01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:30.440
很好  你在这儿干什么
That's good. What are you doing here?

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.360
你在这儿干什么  你不是要走吗
What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.940
出了点小岔子
I got sidetracked.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.440
这是怎么...
What's with the...

01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:36.740
是我的伪装
It's my disguise.

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:38.150
但我能看到你的脸
But I can see your face.

01:23:38.490 --> 01:23:40.030
我这样你不就看不到了
Not when I do this, you can't.

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:41.700
你发型不错
Your hair looks nice.

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:44.620
我喜欢你的处理  换过吗  还是洗了
I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.460
她眼睛上那个是什么
What are those things on her eyes?

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:52.880
是她杀过的人吗
Are those people that she's killed?

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.670
她好美  强壮又勇敢
She's so beautiful and strong and courageous.

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:55.800
这家伙是谁
Who is this guy?

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.760
-我吗  -我朋友
- Who? Me? - He's a friend.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.220
-我是布鲁斯  -我觉得我认识你
- I'm Bruce. - I feel like I know you.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.260
我也这么觉得
I feel like I know you, too.

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:09.020
听着  我多年来浑浑噩噩  想忘记过去
Look, I've spent years in a haze, trying to forget my past.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.400
萨卡似乎是借酒消愁  忘记过去
Sakaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget,

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.770
混吃等死的绝佳之处
and to die one day.

01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:14.940
我是觉得你喝得太多了
I was thinking that you drink too much,

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.320
可能会因此没命
and that probably was gonna kill you.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.900
我没打算停止喝酒
I don't plan to stop drinking.

01:24:18.570 --> 01:24:19.950
但我不想忘记
But I don't wanna forget.

01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:21.070
我不能再扭头不管了
I can't turn away anymore,

01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:23.990
所以  如果我要死
so if I'm gonna die, well,

01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:25.950
那不如是为了把我的剑
it may as well be driving my sword

01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:27.790
插进那个屠夫婆娘的心脏
through the heart of that murderous hag.

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:29.160
-很好  -嗯
- Good. - Yeah.

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:32.330
所以  我是说  我想加入你的团队
So, I'm saying that I wanna be on the team.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.920
有名字了吗
Has it got a name?

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:37.380
嗯  叫报仇者联盟
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:38.300
报仇者
Revengers?

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.630
因为我要报仇  你也要报仇
Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.

01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:44.430
还有你  你想报仇吗
You, too. What do you... Do you want revenge?

01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:47.220
-我还没决定  -好
- I'm undecided. - Okay.

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.060
另外  我还带了示和礼物
Also, I've got a peace offering.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.310
惊不惊喜
Surprise.

01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:03.110
得确认一下
Just had to be sure.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.370
你好  布鲁斯
Hello, Bruce.

01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:13.460
上次我见你时  你想杀了所有人
So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody.

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:14.710
你现在都在忙什么
Where are you at these days?

01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:16.790
每时每刻都不一样
It varies from moment to moment.

01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:19.300
那是龙牙剑吗
Is that a Dragonfang?

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.260
是的
It is.

01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:22.130
天啊
My God.

01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:24.800
这就是著名的女武神之剑
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.510
萨卡和阿斯加德
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about

01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:28.430
之间离得不能更远了
as far apart as any two known systems.

01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:31.060
最好的办法  是走城外的一个虫洞
Our best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits.

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:35.020
在山达尔补充燃料  18个月后就能回到阿斯加德了
Refuel on Xandar, and we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.110
不行  我们要走大的那个
Nope. We are going through the big one.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.860
魔鬼屁眼
The Devil's Anus?

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:40.820
屁眼
Anus?

01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:42.110
等等  谁的屁眼
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:44.450
声明一下  我选的时候不知道它叫这么个名字
For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.

01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:46.700
看起来像是在爱因斯坦罗森桥[虫洞]内
That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.660
坍缩的中子星
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:51.540
我们需要另找艘船  它会把我的船撕成碎片
We need another ship. That will tear mine to pieces.

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:52.910
她说得对  我们需要一艘能禁得住
She's right. We need one that can withstand

01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:54.870
奇点短程线拉力的船
the geodetic strain from the singularity.

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:56.790
还得有脱机动力转向系统
And has an offline power steering system

01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:59.250
没有机载电脑也能运行
that could also function without the on board computer.

01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:00.800
还得有杯托
And we need one with cup holders,

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.010
因为我们要死了  喝酒吧
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:05.010
我认识你吗  我好像认识你
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.

01:26:05.010 --> 01:26:06.890
我也觉得我认识你  好奇怪
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

01:26:06.970 --> 01:26:07.800
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.850
穿过不稳定的宇宙传送门进行未知总星系旅行
Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway.

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:12.230
这才叫冒险
Talk about an adventure.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:14.270
-我们需要一艘飞船  -没错
- We need a ship. - Need a ship.

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:16.900
有那么一两艘飞船  绝对是最顶尖的
There are one or two ships. Absolute top of the line models...

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:18.400
你们不非得听我的
I don't mean to impose...

01:26:20.730 --> 01:26:23.740
但宗师有很多飞船
But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:27.410
我可能还偷到了他安全系统的密码
I may even have stolen the access codes to his security system.

01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:29.870
还突然难以抑制地想行正义之举吗
And suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.

01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:30.950
天啊  不是
Heavens, no.

01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:32.580
宗师对我的好感已消磨殆尽
I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster,

01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.660
我用飞船和密码
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,

01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:38.080
换安全穿过屁眼
I'm asking for safe passage through the Anus.

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:41.420
你是说  你能让我们进入机库
You're telling us that you can get us access into the garage

01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.210
而不触发警报
without setting off any alarms?

01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:44.590
对  哥哥  我可以
Yes, brother. I can.

01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:47.800
好  我先...提醒你们一下
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.890
我几分钟前跟他说话的时候
I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago

01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:52.220
他很想杀了我们
and he was totally ready to kill any of us.

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:53.140
他确实想杀我来着
He did try to kill me.

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.270
是啊  我也是  好多次呢
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.

01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:56.980
我们小时候  有一次
There was one time when we were children,

01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:58.850
他变成了一条蛇
he transformed himself into a snake,

01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:00.190
他知道我喜欢蛇
and he knows that I love snakes.

01:27:00.190 --> 01:27:02.110
我捡起蛇  好好欣赏
So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it,

01:27:02.110 --> 01:27:03.690
结果他变了回去
and he transformed back into himself

01:27:03.690 --> 01:27:04.900
大喊  "嘿  是我"
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:08.070
然后捅了我  我们当时才八岁
And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.

01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:09.660
我们要偷飞船的话
If we're boosting a ship

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:11.660
得把王宫的守卫引开
we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.620
放出野兽吧
Why not set the beast loose?

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:14.330
闭嘴
Shut up.

01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:15.580
你们有野兽
You guys have a beast?

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.040
没有  没什么野兽  他在胡说
No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid.

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.750
我们要挑起革命
We're going to start a revolution.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.670
-革命  -我过会儿再解释
- Revolution? - I'll explain later.

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:24.050
-他是谁来着 -过会儿再解释
- Who's this guy again? - I'll explain later.

01:27:25.090 --> 01:27:27.590
你拉出来的
Is that some sort of protoplasm,

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:30.220
是原生质吗  还是卵
all the stuff that's coming out of you, or are they eggs?

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.430
看起来像卵
Looks like eggs.

01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.480
我找寇格
I'm looking for Korg.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.440
谁找我
Who's asking?

01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.940
我知道是你
I know you're asking.

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:48.650
还有别人吗  还是只有你
Is there anyone else asking, or is it just you?

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:50.910
雷王向你问好
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:56.080
革命开始了
The revolution has begun.

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:58.620
革命  怎么会这样
Revolution? How did this happen?

01:27:58.710 --> 01:27:59.500
不知道
Don't know.

01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:02.790
但角斗场的服从圆盘主机
But the arena's mainframe for the Obedience Disks

01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:04.050
被关掉了
have been deactivated

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:06.170
奴隶都武装起来了
and the slaves have armed themselves.

01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:07.670
我不喜欢那个词
I don't like that word.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.220
哪个  主机吗
Which? Mainframe?

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.680
不是  我怎么会不喜欢"主机"
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.930
S开头的那个
No, the "S" word.

01:28:13.930 --> 01:28:17.100
抱歉  在职囚犯们都武装起来了
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.770
这样好多了
Okay, that's better. That's better.

01:28:25.690 --> 01:28:27.610
听着  我们应该谈谈
So, listen. We should talk.

01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:30.030
我不同意
I disagree.

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.200
我们家从来就不擅长开诚布公
Open communication was never our family's forte.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.700
可不是呢
You have no idea.

01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:37.410
我们上次谈过后发现的真相很是了不得
Been quite the revelation since we last spoke.

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:38.660
你们好
Hello.

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:49.130
奥丁让我们聚在一起
Odin brought us together.

01:28:50.010 --> 01:28:52.680
他的死让我们分裂  还挺诗意
It's almost poetic that his death should split us apart.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.640
我们现在与陌生人无异
We might as well be strangers now.

01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:04.400
两位王子  各自漂泊
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

01:29:07.570 --> 01:29:08.980
你不是不想谈吗
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:11.700
问题是...
Here's the thing.

01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:13.570
我可能留在萨卡更好
I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.

01:29:13.570 --> 01:29:15.200
我也这么想
That's exactly what I was thinking.

01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:18.700
你刚刚是在同意我说的话吗
Did you just agree with me?

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:20.500
这地方太适合你了
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.370
野蛮  混乱  无法无天
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:23.750
弟弟  你会在这儿如鱼得水的
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:26.380
你就真这么瞧不起我
Do you truly think so little of me?

01:29:28.210 --> 01:29:30.050
洛基  我曾非常看重你
Loki, I thought the world of you.

01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:33.050
我以为我们能永远并肩战斗
I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.

01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:36.640
但最终  你是你  我是我
But at the end of the day, you're you and I'm me.

01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:39.560
我也说不好  或许你还有一丝良心  但
I don't know, maybe there's still good in you, but...

01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:43.140
说实话  我们早已分道扬镳
let's be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago.

01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.770
是啊
Yeah.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.610
或许我们还是再也不要见面了比较好
It's probably for the best that we never see each other again.

01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:54.070
这不是你一直想要的吗
It's what you always wanted.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.580
我们来演"喊救命"吧
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.660
-什么  -"喊救命"
- What? - "Get Help."

01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:02.330
不
No.

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.410
-来嘛  你最喜欢了  -我非常讨厌
- Come on, you love it. - I hate it.

01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:05.250
-这招多棒啊  每次都好使  -太丢人了
- It's great. It works every time. - It's humiliating.

01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:06.500
-你有更好的计划吗  -没有
- Do you have a better plan? - No.

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:07.380
那就这么办
We're doing it.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.880
我才不要演"喊救命"
We are not doing "Get Help."

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.420
救命  求你们了
Get help! Please!

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.590
我弟弟快死了
My brother, he's dying.

01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:15.470
救命  帮帮他吧
Get help! Help him!

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.600
经典
Classic.

01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:20.010
我还是讨厌
Still hate it.

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.220
-太丢人了  -我又不丢人
- It's humiliating. - Not for me, it's not.

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:24.810
好了  她让我们上哪艘船来着
Now, which one's the ship she told us to get?

01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:26.230
司令号
The Commodore.

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:27.610
好的
Right.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.690
不过我觉得应该也没什么用
Though I feel it won't make much of a difference.

01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:37.110
洛基
Loki.

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.870
我知道我背叛过你很多次
I know I've betrayed you many times before,

01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:41.700
但这次真不是针对你
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.870
抓到你的赏金会让我过得很阔绰
The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.

01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:46.460
你果然从不是个重感情的人
Never one for sentiment, were you?

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.080
无情会过得更轻松些
Easier to let it burn.

01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:49.500
我同意
I agree.

01:30:58.050 --> 01:30:59.390
看起来好痛
That looks painful.

01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:03.310
亲爱的弟弟  你越来越好猜了
Dear brother, you're becoming predictable.

01:31:03.310 --> 01:31:05.180
我信任你  你背叛我
I trust you, you betray me.

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:07.480
一遍又一遍
Round and round in circles we go.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.940
洛基  人生  是要成长的
See, Loki, life is about... It's about growth.

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:10.900
是要改变的
It's about change.

01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:14.360
但你好像只想保持原样
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:16.320
我想说的是
I guess what I'm trying to say

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.450
你永远都只是恶作剧之神
is that you'll always be the God of Mischief,

01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:21.450
但你本可不止如此
but you could be more.

01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:25.660
我就把这个留给你了
I'll just put this over here for you.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.670
好了  我们都还有地方要去  所以祝你好运了
Anyway, all got places to be, so good luck, I guess.

01:31:35.130 --> 01:31:37.130
好了  你能搞定的
All right, you can figure this out.

01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:38.720
不过是又一艘宇宙飞船罢了
It's just another spaceship.

01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:53.570
忠诚的萨卡人
Loyal Sakaarians,

01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:57.400
雷王偷了我的飞船和我最爱的冠军
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion.

01:31:58.570 --> 01:32:01.950
萨卡人  升空  把他打下来
Sakaarians, take to the skies. Bring him down.

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:03.830
不要让他离开这个星球
Do not let him leave this planet.

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:18.510
-打得不错  -谢谢
- Good shot! - Thanks.

01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:21.970
开门
Open the doors.

01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:22.890
好
Okay.

01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:30.640
我希望你比看起来要坚强一些
I hope that you're tougher than you look.

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.690
为什么
Why?

01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:46.240
我们不该反击什么的吗
Shouldn't we be shooting back or something?

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.240
是应该
Yes, we should.

01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:49.370
这船上的武器在哪里
Where are the guns on this ship?

01:32:49.410 --> 01:32:50.830
没有武器
There aren't any.

01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:52.710
-这是艘消遣船  -什么
- It's a leisure vessel. - What?

01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:56.000
宗师用它来享乐的  群交派对之类的
Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.

01:32:56.050 --> 01:32:58.590
她刚刚是说宗师用这船办群交派对吗
Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?

01:32:58.590 --> 01:32:59.420
是的
Yeah.

01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:01.050
什么都别碰
Don't touch anything.

01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:22.570
不  不
No! No!

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:27.370
-不  -不
- No! - No!

01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:35.250
进来
Get inside!

01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:36.710
马上
In a minute.

01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:49.850
我该去帮帮她  你过来开
I should probably go and help. Here, take the wheel.

01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:51.680
不行  我不会开这个
No. I don't know how to fly one of these.

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.480
你是个科学家  用你的博士学位去搞明白
You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:57.310
那些学位都不是外星飞船驾驶啊
None of them are for flying alien spaceships!

01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:32.600
好吧  拜托
Okay, come on.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.270
这上面肯定有枪的
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:35.890
那看起来好像是枪
That looks like a gun.

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:40.360
今天我生日  今天我生日
It's my birthday. It's my birthday.

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.780
今天我生日
It's my birthday.

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:50.830
好啊
Yeah!

01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:10.600
伙计们  我们马上就要进入恶魔屁眼了
Guys, we're coming up on the Devil's Anus!

01:35:17.230 --> 01:35:18.520
在那儿
There she is.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:19.980
我们逃离的途径
Our ticket out of here.

01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:22.230
这是什么
Hey, what's this?

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.070
谢谢
Thank you.

01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:31.070
老兄  我们要跳上那艘超大飞船离开这里
Hey, man. We're about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.

01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.870
要一起来吗
You wanna come?

01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:36.750
你们看起来确实急需一位领袖
You do seem like you're in desperate need of leadership.

01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:37.870
谢谢
Why, thank you.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.340
来了
Here we go.

01:35:50.050 --> 01:35:50.930
该死
Shit.

01:36:08.110 --> 01:36:10.030
阿斯加德人民
Asgardians...

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.870
有不知好歹的人
Some misguided soul

01:36:13.410 --> 01:36:15.620
偷走了彩虹桥之剑
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.790
告诉我们它在哪里
Tell us where it is

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.830
否则后果自负
or there will be consequences.

01:36:24.710 --> 01:36:26.300
严重的后果
Bad ones.

01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:29.970
有人说吗
Well?

01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:38.310
你
You.

01:36:41.190 --> 01:36:43.150
不  住手
No! Stop!

01:36:45.690 --> 01:36:46.400
求你们
Please.

01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:18.390
动手啊  处刑人
Well? Executioner?

01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:24.480
等等
Wait!

01:37:25.150 --> 01:37:25.900
等等
Wait!

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:29.690
我知道剑在哪
I know where the sword is.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.200
没想到我还能再回来
I never thought I'd be back here.

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:19.830
我以为会更美一些呢
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.540
倒不是说它不美  只是着火了
I mean, not that it's not nice. It's just, it's on fire.

01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:25.000
看  山上
Here, up here in the mountains.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.330
有热信号  那里聚集了很多人
Heat signatures. People clustered together.

01:38:27.330 --> 01:38:28.420
她要去找他们了
She's coming for them.

01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:30.800
好  把我丢在王宫  我去引开她
Okay, drop me off at the palace and I'll draw her away.

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.960
你想害死自己吗
And get yourself killed?

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.590
困在那里的人才是最重要的
The people trapped down there are all that matters.

01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:34.840
我去应付海拉时
While I'm dealing with Hela,

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.800
你们得疏散阿斯加德的人民
I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard.

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.550
我们要怎么做啊
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:40.600
我在地面上有人接应
I have a man on the ground.

01:38:46.730 --> 01:38:47.810
阿斯加德人民
Asgard.

01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:51.860
她来了
She's here.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.580
这下飞船有火力了
Now the ship has a gun.

01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:06.960
交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:10.670
我在武器库发现了这个
I found this in the armory.

01:39:14.210 --> 01:39:15.010
祝你好运
Good luck.

01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:17.800
陛下
Your Majesty...

01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:21.100
别死了
Don't die.

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:25.100
你懂我意思的
You know what I mean.

01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:26.160
别停步
We must keep moving!

01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:28.870
去彩虹桥
Go to the Bifrost!

01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:12.580
姐姐
Sister.

01:41:15.210 --> 01:41:16.670
你还活着
You're still alive.

01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:20.550
我喜欢你对这里的改造  重装修了啊
I love what you've done with the place. Redecorating, I see.

01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:22.840
看来我们父亲解决
It seems our father's solution

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.930
所有问题的思路都是掩盖
to every problem was to cover it up.

01:41:26.970 --> 01:41:28.390
或驱逐
Or to cast it out.

01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:34.230
他对你说你有资格  他也对我说过这话
He told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.

01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:36.150
你瞧
You see?

01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:38.610
你根本不了解他
You never knew him.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.900
没见过他最辉煌的时刻
Not at his best.

01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:46.200
奥丁和我曾让整个文明淹死在血泪之中
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears.

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.620
你以为这些金子是哪来的
Where do you think all this gold came from?

01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:51.250
然后  有一天
And then, one day,

01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:53.870
他突然决定做个仁慈的君王
he decided to become a benevolent king.

01:41:54.330 --> 01:41:56.710
制造和平  保护生命
To foster peace, to protect life.

01:41:58.130 --> 01:41:59.550
生下你
To have you.

01:42:00.210 --> 01:42:02.170
我能理解你的愤怒
I understand why you're angry.

01:42:02.170 --> 01:42:03.340
你毕竟是我姐姐
And you are my sister,

01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:06.090
严格讲  有权继承王位
and technically have a claim to the throne.

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.720
相信我  我也愿意别人来统治
And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule.

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:09.890
但那不能是你
But it can't be you.

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:13.600
你真是坏透了
You're just the worst.

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.610
好吧  起来
Okay, get up.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.860
你坐在我的位置上了
You're in my seat.

01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:21.900
父亲曾对我说
You know, Father once told me

01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:25.030
一位明君从不挑起战争
that a wise king never seeks out war.

01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:27.950
但必须时刻做好准备
But must always be ready for it.

01:42:59.730 --> 01:43:00.650
回去
Go back!

01:43:06.450 --> 01:43:07.110
回去
Go!

01:43:42.730 --> 01:43:44.900
老实说  我以为你有更大本事呢
To be honest, I expected more.

01:43:48.450 --> 01:43:50.160
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:53.450
剑
The sword!

01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.790
我们的不同之处在于
Here's the difference between us.

01:43:59.790 --> 01:44:01.330
我是奥丁的长女
I'm Odin's firstborn,

01:44:01.330 --> 01:44:04.300
合法继承人  阿斯加德的拯救者
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:05.840
你什么都不是
And you're nothing.

01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:19.310
如此简单  瞎子都看得清
So simple, even a blind man could see it.

01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:24.860
这下你让我想起了爸爸
Now you remind me of Dad.

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:37.450
那只臭狗打不死
The stupid dog won't die!

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.690
没事了  交给我吧
Everything's gonna be all right now. I got this.

01:45:01.690 --> 01:45:03.520
你想知道我是谁
You wanted to know who I am?

01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:06.730
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

01:45:07.110 --> 01:45:08.230
你会看到的
You'll see!

01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:59.450
瞧  谁都别想跑
You see? No one's going anywhere.

01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:00.620
我会拿到那把剑
I'll get that sword,

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.000
哪怕我为此要杀光他们每个人
even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:31.280
伙计
Hey, man.

01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:34.280
我是寇格  这是米克
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:36.320
我们要跳上那艘飞船离开这里
We're gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here.

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.200
要一起来吗
Wanna come?

01:46:46.290 --> 01:46:50.380
你们的拯救者到了
Your savior is here.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:58.720
想我了吗
Did you miss me?

01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:01.390
大家快上船吧
Everyone, on that ship now.

01:47:05.730 --> 01:47:07.980
欢迎回家  我看到你来了
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:08.770
当然了
Of course you did.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.420
虽然是英勇之举  但你们毫无胜算
It's a valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:29.790
瞧
You see...

01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:33.800
我不是女王  或怪物
I'm not a queen or a monster.

01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:37.300
我是死亡女神
I'm the Goddess of Death.

01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:40.640
你是什么的神来着
What were you the god of, again?

01:47:52.110 --> 01:47:54.110
就算是你有两只眼睛时
Even when you had two eyes,

01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:56.440
也只能看清一半
you'd see only half the picture.

01:47:58.110 --> 01:48:01.200
她太强大了  没有锤子  我做不到
She's too strong. Without my hammer, I can't.

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.540
你是托尔  锤子之神吗
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?

01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:12.420
锤子是用来帮你控制力量  集中力量的
That hammer was to help you control your power, to focus it.

01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:15.000
不是你力量的源泉
It was never your source of strength.

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.300
太迟了  她已经夺下了阿斯加德
It's too late. She's already taken Asgard.

01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:21.550
阿斯加德不是一个地方  从来不是
Asgard is not a place. Never was.

01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:24.430
这里就可以是阿斯加德
This could be Asgard.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.770
阿斯加德是我们人民的所在
Asgard is where our people stand.

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:33.440
而现在  那些人民需要你的帮助
Even now, right now, those people need your help.

01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:42.530
我不像你那么强大
I'm not as strong as you.

01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:46.620
是啊
No...

01:48:48.450 --> 01:48:49.290
你比我更强大
You're stronger.

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.090
告诉我  弟弟
Tell me, brother.

01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:02.590
你是什么的神来着
What were you the god of, again?

01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:20.270
-你来迟了  -你缺了只眼睛
- You're late. - You're missing an eye.

01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:21.480
还没打完呢
This isn't over.

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:31.160
我觉得我们该解散报仇者
I think we should disband the Revengers.

01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:33.620
用闪电打她
Hit her with a lightning blast.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:34.540
我刚用史上
I just hit her with the

01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:36.410
最大的闪电打她了
biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning.

01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:37.500
毫无作用
It did nothing.

01:51:41.130 --> 01:51:43.750
我们得抵住她  直到大家都上了船
We just need to hold her off until everyone's on board.

01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:45.470
那也不是个完
It won't end there.

01:51:46.050 --> 01:51:49.430
海拉在阿斯加德待得越久  她就越强大
The longer Hela's on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.

01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:50.680
她会找到我们的
She'll hunt us down.

01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:53.180
我们得在此时此地阻止她
We need to stop her here and now.

01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:54.390
我们怎么办
So what do we do?

01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:56.640
我不要再演"喊救命"了
I'm not doing "Get Help."

01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:11.240
阿斯加德不是一个地方  是人民所在
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

01:52:14.410 --> 01:52:15.200
洛基
Loki,

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:17.370
我们根本不是要阻止诸神黄昏
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

01:52:17.370 --> 01:52:19.750
我们要引发诸神黄昏
This was about causing Ragnarok.

01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:21.580
苏尔特尔的王冠  在地堡里
Surtur's crown, the vault.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:23.840
只能如此
It's the only way.

01:52:25.050 --> 01:52:26.130
真大胆  哥哥
Bold move, brother.

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.720
我都不敢想
Even for me.

01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:33.350
我们来吧
Shall we?

01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:35.720
你先请
After you.

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.250
这真是疯了
This is madness.

01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:17.890
走  快走
Go! Go, now!

01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:20.290
为了阿斯加德
For Asgard.

01:54:34.590 --> 01:54:35.930
海拉
Hela!

01:55:00.370 --> 01:55:04.330
永恒烈火将让你重生
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:17.590
海拉  够了
Hela, enough!

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:23.850
你想要阿斯加德  它是你的了
You want Asgard, it's yours.

01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:27.480
不管你在玩什么把戏  不会成功的
Whatever game you're playing, it won't work.

01:55:27.810 --> 01:55:29.520
你休想打败我
You can't defeat me.

01:55:30.190 --> 01:55:31.150
我知道
No, I know.

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:34.110
但他能
But he can.

01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:39.320
不
No.

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:51.290
在我脚下震颤吧  阿斯加德
Tremble before me, Asgard!

01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:54.130
我是你的末日
I am your reckoning!

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:04.010
人民安全了
The people are safe.

01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:06.100
那才是最重要的
That's all that matters.

01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:10.310
我们实现了预言
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

01:56:10.650 --> 01:56:11.860
我恨这则预言
I hate this prophecy.

01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:13.980
我也是  但我们没别的办法
So do I, but we have no choice.

01:56:14.150 --> 01:56:15.740
苏尔特尔毁掉阿斯加德
Surtur destroys Asgard,

01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:18.320
才能毁掉海拉  我们的人民才能生还
he destroys Hela, so that our people may live.

01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:20.990
但我们得让他做完  否则
But we need to let him finish the job, otherwise...

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.080
不
No!

01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:28.290
绿巨人  停下  你个白痴
Hulk, stop, you moron!

01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.720
绿巨人  停下
Hulk, stop.

01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:41.970
就这一次  别砸了
Just for once in your life, don't smash.

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.010
大怪物
Big monster!

01:56:45.010 --> 01:56:45.930
我们走吧
Let's go!

01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:48.600
好吧
Fine.

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:16.090
我是阿斯加德的末日
I am Asgard's doom!

01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:40.860
毁得还不算太严重
The damage is not too bad.

01:57:41.070 --> 01:57:43.280
只要地基还撑得住
As long as the foundations are still strong,

01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.030
我们还能重建
we can rebuild this place.

01:57:45.490 --> 01:57:48.950
它可以成为全宇宙人民
It will become a haven for all peoples

01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:50.750
和外星人的避难所
and aliens of the universe.

01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.800
这下地基是没了  抱歉
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.

01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:16.190
我做了什么啊
What have I done?

01:58:18.110 --> 01:58:19.730
你让我们免遭灭绝
You saved us from extinction.

01:58:20.650 --> 01:58:22.570
阿斯加德不是一个地方
Asgard is not a place...

01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.990
是人民的所在
It's a people.

01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:55.640
挺适合你
It suits you.

01:58:59.110 --> 01:59:01.610
或许你也没那么坏  弟弟
Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.

01:59:02.190 --> 01:59:03.030
或许吧
Maybe not.

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:05.150
谢谢
Thank you.

01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:08.200
如果你真在这里  我或许还会抱抱你
If you were here, I might even give you a hug.

01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:13.700
我在这儿
I'm here.

01:59:38.690 --> 01:59:39.400
你的王位
Your throne.

01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:58.580
那么  阿斯加德国王
So, King of Asgard.

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:09.470
我们去哪
Where to?

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:11.890
我不确定
I'm not sure.

02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:14.010
有什么提议吗
Any suggestions?

02:00:16.810 --> 02:00:18.690
米克  你是哪来的
Miek, where are you from?

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:20.060
米克死了
Miek's dead.

02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:23.860
是啊  我刚刚在桥上不小心踩到了他
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge.

02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:27.320
我好愧疚  我抱了他一天了
I've just felt so guilty, I've been carrying him around all day.

02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:30.990
米克  你还活着
Miek, you're alive!

02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:33.620
他还活着  你刚问什么来着  哥们
He's alive, guys. What was your question again, bro?

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.200
去地球吧
Earth it is.

02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:44.210
<b>雷神3：诸神黄昏</b>

02:02:53.090 --> 02:02:55.880
你真觉得回地球是个好主意吗
Do you really think it's a good idea to go back to Earth?

02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:59.010
当然  地球人民喜欢我  我很受欢迎
Yes, of course. The people of Earth love me. I'm very popular.

02:02:59.970 --> 02:03:01.560
我换个说法
Let me rephrase that.

02:03:01.930 --> 02:03:05.480
你真觉得带我回地球是个好主意吗
Do you really think it's a good idea to bring me back to Earth?

02:03:05.850 --> 02:03:07.400
老实说  或许不是
Probably not, to be honest.

02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:09.310
别担心  弟弟
I wouldn't worry, brother.

02:03:09.570 --> 02:03:11.690
我觉得一切都会没问题的
I feel like everything's gonna work out fine.

02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:42.710
天呐
Oh, boy.

02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:54.640
我想说  我为你们所有人骄傲
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.

02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:58.930
这场革命非常成功  大家好棒
This revolution has been a huge success. Yay, us!

02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:01.730
鼓励鼓励自己  干得好
Pat on the back. Pat on the back.

02:10:01.730 --> 02:10:03.940
来嘛  不吗
Come on. No?

02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:06.480
我也是  因为我是其中重要的一部分
Me too. 'Cause I've been a big part of it.

02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:09.320
没有人去推翻  哪里来的革命呢
Can't have a revolution without somebody to overthrow.

02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:11.280
所以  不客气
So, you're welcome.

02:10:11.610 --> 02:10:13.990
我们平手了
And it's a tie.

02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:23.330
雷神将在《复仇者联盟3: 无限战争》中回归
