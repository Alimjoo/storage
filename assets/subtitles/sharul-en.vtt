WEBVTT

00:15.471 --> 00:16.671
Namaskar.

00:17.630 --> 00:20.110
I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age,

00:21.408 --> 00:23.664
and I don't use Botox as yet.

00:23.688 --> 00:24.904
(Laughter)

00:24.928 --> 00:29.128
So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw
like a 21-year-old in my movies.

00:30.288 --> 00:31.504
Yeah, I do that.

00:31.528 --> 00:36.424
I sell dreams, and I peddle love
to millions of people back home in India

00:36.448 --> 00:38.704
who assume that I'm
the best lover in the world.

00:38.728 --> 00:40.928
(Laughter)

00:41.888 --> 00:44.544
If you don't tell anyone,
I'm going to tell you I'm not,

00:44.568 --> 00:46.504
but I never let that assumption go away.

00:46.528 --> 00:47.544
(Laughter)

00:47.568 --> 00:49.184
I've also been made to understand

00:49.208 --> 00:51.664
there are lots of you here
who haven't seen my work,

00:51.688 --> 00:53.144
and I feel really sad for you.

00:53.168 --> 00:55.583
(Laughter)

00:55.608 --> 00:58.288
(Applause)

01:00.648 --> 01:03.984
That doesn't take away from the fact
that I'm completely self-obsessed,

01:04.007 --> 01:05.263
as a movie star should be.

01:05.288 --> 01:06.344
(Laughter)

01:06.368 --> 01:09.984
That's when my friends,
Chris and Juliet called me here

01:10.008 --> 01:11.574
to speak about the future "you."

01:11.598 --> 01:14.533
Naturally, it follows I'm going
to speak about the present me.

01:14.558 --> 01:16.878
(Laughter)

01:19.088 --> 01:21.863
Because I truly believe
that humanity is a lot like me.

01:21.888 --> 01:23.104
(Laughter)

01:23.128 --> 01:24.504
It is. It is.

01:24.528 --> 01:26.048
It's an aging movie star,

01:27.248 --> 01:29.824
grappling with all
the newness around itself,

01:29.848 --> 01:32.504
wondering whether
it got it right in the first place,

01:32.528 --> 01:34.544
and still trying to find a way

01:34.568 --> 01:36.648
to keep on shining regardless.

01:37.528 --> 01:40.888
I was born in a refugee colony
in the capital city of India, New Delhi.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.264
And my father was a freedom fighter.

01:44.288 --> 01:47.318
My mother was, well,
just a fighter like mothers are.

01:49.368 --> 01:52.384
And much like the original homo sapiens,

01:52.408 --> 01:54.048
we struggled to survive.

01:54.728 --> 01:56.863
When I was in my early 20s,

01:56.888 --> 01:58.624
I lost both my parents,

01:58.648 --> 02:01.984
which I must admit
seems a bit careless of me now,

02:02.008 --> 02:03.304
but --

02:03.328 --> 02:06.328
(Laughter)

02:08.848 --> 02:10.744
I do remember the night my father died,

02:10.768 --> 02:15.664
and I remember the driver of a neighbor
who was driving us to the hospital.

02:15.688 --> 02:18.504
He mumbled something
about "dead people don't tip so well"

02:18.528 --> 02:19.968
and walked away into the dark.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.703
And I was only 14 then,

02:22.728 --> 02:26.184
and I put my father's dead body
in the back seat of the car,

02:26.208 --> 02:27.424
and my mother besides me,

02:27.448 --> 02:30.024
I started driving back
from the hospital to the house.

02:30.048 --> 02:33.664
And in the middle of her quiet crying,
my mother looked at me and she said,

02:33.688 --> 02:35.488
"Son, when did you learn to drive?"

02:37.848 --> 02:41.104
And I thought about it
and realized, and I said to my mom,

02:41.128 --> 02:42.423
"Just now, Mom."

02:42.448 --> 02:44.704
(Laughter)

02:44.728 --> 02:46.264
So from that night onwards,

02:46.288 --> 02:48.984
much akin to humanity in its adolescence,

02:49.008 --> 02:52.328
I learned the crude tools of survival.

02:52.968 --> 02:56.624
And the framework of life was
very, very simple then, to be honest.

02:56.648 --> 02:59.624
You know, you just ate what you got

02:59.648 --> 03:01.464
and did whatever you were told to do.

03:01.488 --> 03:04.824
I thought celiac was a vegetable,

03:04.848 --> 03:09.384
and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's
lost comrade in "Star Trek."

03:09.408 --> 03:10.504
(Laughter)

03:10.528 --> 03:13.504
You married the first girl that you dated,

03:13.528 --> 03:17.368
and you were a techie if you could fix
the carburetor in your car.

03:18.928 --> 03:22.408
I really thought that gay was
a sophisticated English word for happy.

03:23.648 --> 03:26.904
And Lesbian, of course, was the capital
of Portugal, as you all know.

03:26.928 --> 03:28.184
(Laughter)

03:28.208 --> 03:29.408
Where was I?

03:32.528 --> 03:34.864
We relied on systems

03:34.888 --> 03:38.584
created through the toil and sacrifice
of generations before

03:38.608 --> 03:40.064
to protect us,

03:40.088 --> 03:43.744
and we felt that governments
actually worked for our betterment.

03:43.768 --> 03:45.704
Science was simple and logical,

03:45.728 --> 03:48.048
Apple was still then just a fruit

03:49.128 --> 03:51.064
owned by Eve first and then Newton,

03:51.088 --> 03:53.424
not by Steve Jobs, until then.

03:53.448 --> 03:55.144
And "Eureka!" was what you screamed

03:55.168 --> 03:57.368
when you wanted
to run naked on the streets.

03:58.048 --> 04:01.664
You went wherever life took you for work,

04:01.688 --> 04:03.768
and people were mostly welcoming of you.

04:04.408 --> 04:06.384
Migration was a term then

04:06.408 --> 04:08.968
still reserved for Siberian cranes,
not human beings.

04:09.808 --> 04:12.664
Most importantly, you were who you were

04:12.688 --> 04:14.528
and you said what you thought.

04:15.208 --> 04:16.464
Then in my late 20s,

04:16.488 --> 04:20.224
I shifted to the sprawling
metropolis of Mumbai,

04:20.248 --> 04:21.584
and my framework,

04:21.608 --> 04:24.904
like the newly industrialized
aspirational humanity,

04:24.928 --> 04:26.128
began to alter.

04:26.768 --> 04:29.368
In the urban rush for a new,
more embellished survival,

04:30.207 --> 04:32.224
things started to look a little different.

04:32.248 --> 04:35.048
I met people who had descended
from all over the world,

04:35.968 --> 04:39.184
faces, races, genders, money-lenders.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.328
Definitions became more and more fluid.

04:42.088 --> 04:44.448
Work began to define you at that time

04:45.208 --> 04:47.864
in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,

04:47.888 --> 04:50.744
and all the systems
started to feel less reliable to me,

04:50.768 --> 04:53.904
almost too thick to hold on

04:53.928 --> 04:55.904
to the diversity of mankind

04:55.928 --> 04:57.968
and the human need to progress and grow.

04:59.328 --> 05:02.248
Ideas were flowing
with more freedom and speed.

05:03.208 --> 05:08.544
And I experienced the miracle
of human innovation and cooperation,

05:08.568 --> 05:09.984
and my own creativity,

05:10.008 --> 05:14.503
when supported by the resourcefulness
of this collective endeavor,

05:14.528 --> 05:16.368
catapulted me into superstardom.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.384
I started to feel that I had arrived,

05:19.408 --> 05:22.904
and generally, by the time I was 40,
I was really, really flying.

05:22.928 --> 05:24.183
I was all over the place.

05:24.208 --> 05:26.224
You know? I'd done 50 films by then

05:26.248 --> 05:27.848
and 200 songs,

05:28.608 --> 05:30.864
and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.

05:30.888 --> 05:34.183
I had been given the highest civil honor
by the French government,

05:34.208 --> 05:37.544
the title of which for the life of me
I can't pronounce even until now.

05:37.568 --> 05:38.623
(Laughter)

05:38.648 --> 05:42.064
I'm sorry, France, and thank you,
France, for doing that.

05:42.088 --> 05:45.424
But much bigger than that,
I got to meet Angelina Jolie --

05:45.448 --> 05:48.183
(Laughter)

05:48.208 --> 05:49.704
for two and a half seconds.

05:49.728 --> 05:51.024
(Laughter)

05:51.048 --> 05:53.744
And I'm sure she also remembers
that encounter somewhere.

05:53.768 --> 05:54.984
OK, maybe not.

05:55.008 --> 05:58.544
And I sat next to Hannah Montana
on a round dinner table

05:58.568 --> 06:00.608
with her back towards me most of the time.

06:01.408 --> 06:03.648
Like I said, I was flying,
from Miley to Jolie,

06:04.568 --> 06:07.823
and humanity was soaring with me.

06:07.848 --> 06:10.528
We were both pretty much
flying off the handle, actually.

06:11.088 --> 06:12.808
And then you all know what happened.

06:13.328 --> 06:14.568
The internet happened.

06:15.568 --> 06:17.503
I was in my late 40s,

06:17.528 --> 06:20.168
and I started tweeting
like a canary in a birdcage

06:21.088 --> 06:24.064
and assuming that, you know,
people who peered into my world

06:24.088 --> 06:25.344
would admire it

06:25.368 --> 06:27.464
for the miracle I believed it to be.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.688
But something else
awaited me and humanity.

06:30.568 --> 06:35.464
You know, we had expected
an expansion of ideas and dreams

06:35.488 --> 06:38.088
with the enhanced
connectivity of the world.

06:38.848 --> 06:45.328
We had not bargained
for the village-like enclosure of thought,

06:46.528 --> 06:48.544
of judgment, of definition

06:48.568 --> 06:50.704
that flowed from the same place

06:50.728 --> 06:52.968
that freedom and revolution
was taking place in.

06:54.328 --> 06:56.090
Everything I said took a new meaning.

06:56.728 --> 06:58.688
Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly --

06:59.648 --> 07:02.984
was there for the world
to comment upon and judge.

07:03.008 --> 07:05.608
As a matter of fact,
everything I didn't say or do also

07:06.408 --> 07:07.608
met with the same fate.

07:08.528 --> 07:09.728
Four years ago,

07:10.768 --> 07:14.727
my lovely wife Gauri and me
decided to have a third child.

07:15.808 --> 07:17.488
It was claimed on the net

07:18.608 --> 07:20.704
that he was the love child

07:20.728 --> 07:21.928
of our first child

07:22.528 --> 07:23.808
who was 15 years old.

07:24.608 --> 07:27.704
Apparently, he had sown
his wild oats with a girl

07:27.728 --> 07:29.928
while driving her car in Romania.

07:30.808 --> 07:33.008
And yeah, there was
a fake video to go with it.

07:33.448 --> 07:35.263
And we were so disturbed as a family.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.544
My son, who is 19 now,

07:36.568 --> 07:38.383
even now when you say "hello" to him,

07:38.408 --> 07:39.864
he just turns around and says,

07:39.888 --> 07:42.584
"But bro, I didn't even have
a European driving license."

07:42.608 --> 07:45.064
(Laughter)

07:45.088 --> 07:46.368
Yeah.

07:46.848 --> 07:48.544
In this new world,

07:48.568 --> 07:51.943
slowly, reality became virtual
and virtual became real,

07:51.968 --> 07:53.624
and I started to feel

07:53.648 --> 07:57.184
that I could not be who I wanted to be
or say what I actually thought,

07:57.208 --> 07:59.008
and humanity at this time

08:00.128 --> 08:02.063
completely identified with me.

08:02.088 --> 08:05.088
I think both of us
were going through our midlife crisis,

08:06.128 --> 08:10.224
and humanity, like me,
was becoming an overexposed prima donna.

08:10.248 --> 08:11.944
I started to sell everything,

08:11.968 --> 08:14.864
from hair oil to diesel generators.

08:14.888 --> 08:16.904
Humanity was buying everything

08:16.928 --> 08:19.304
from crude oil to nuclear reactors.

08:19.328 --> 08:23.304
You know, I even tried
to get into a skintight superhero suit

08:23.328 --> 08:25.368
to reinvent myself.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.048
I must admit I failed miserably.

08:28.848 --> 08:33.864
And just an aside I want to say
on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men

08:33.888 --> 08:35.984
and Supermen of the world,

08:36.008 --> 08:37.864
you have to commend them,

08:37.888 --> 08:40.664
because it really hurts in the crotch,
that superhero suit.

08:40.688 --> 08:41.744
(Laughter)

08:41.768 --> 08:44.248
Yeah, I'm being honest.
I need to tell you this here.

08:45.768 --> 08:46.984
Really.

08:47.008 --> 08:50.544
And accidentally, I happened
to even invent a new dance form

08:50.568 --> 08:52.703
which I didn't realize,
and it became a rage.

08:52.727 --> 08:53.943
So if it's all right,

08:53.967 --> 08:57.144
and you've seen a bit of me,
so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.

08:57.168 --> 08:58.624
It was called the Lungi dance.

08:58.648 --> 09:01.744
So if it's all right, I'll just show you.
I'm talented otherwise.

09:01.768 --> 09:02.984
(Cheers)

09:03.008 --> 09:05.088
So it went something like this.

09:05.688 --> 09:08.104
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.

09:08.128 --> 09:10.544
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.

09:10.568 --> 09:13.223
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.904
That's it. It became a rage.

09:14.928 --> 09:16.224
(Cheers)

09:16.248 --> 09:17.448
It really did.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.424
Like you notice, nobody could make
any sense of what was happening except me,

09:23.448 --> 09:25.064
and I didn't give a damn, really,

09:25.088 --> 09:27.304
because the whole world,
and whole humanity,

09:27.328 --> 09:29.247
seemed as confused and lost as I was.

09:30.368 --> 09:31.624
I didn't give up then.

09:31.648 --> 09:34.424
I even tried to reconstruct
my identity on the social media

09:34.448 --> 09:35.704
like everyone else does.

09:35.728 --> 09:38.464
I thought if I put on
philosophical tweets out there

09:38.488 --> 09:40.064
people will think I'm with it,

09:40.088 --> 09:42.664
but some of the responses I got
from those tweets

09:42.688 --> 09:46.024
were extremely confusing acronyms
which I didn't understand. You know?

09:46.048 --> 09:48.104
ROFL, LOL.

09:48.128 --> 09:52.424
"Adidas," somebody wrote back
to one of my more thought-provoking tweets

09:52.448 --> 09:54.784
and I was wondering
why would you name a sneaker,

09:54.808 --> 09:57.704
I mean, why would you write back
the name of a sneaker to me?

09:57.728 --> 10:00.584
And I asked my 16-year-old daughter,
and she enlightened me.

10:00.608 --> 10:03.568
"Adidas" now means
"All day I dream about sex."

10:04.128 --> 10:06.384
(Laughter)

10:06.408 --> 10:07.704
Really.

10:07.728 --> 10:09.223
I didn't know if you know that.

10:09.248 --> 10:13.824
So I wrote back,
"WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas,

10:13.848 --> 10:18.288
thanking secretly that some acronyms
and things won't change at all.

10:19.008 --> 10:20.208
WTF.

10:22.008 --> 10:23.328
But here we are.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.904
I am 51 years old, like I told you,

10:25.928 --> 10:29.504
and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,

10:29.528 --> 10:30.824
I just want to tell you

10:30.848 --> 10:34.064
if there has been a momentous time
for humanity to exist,

10:34.088 --> 10:35.704
it is now,

10:35.728 --> 10:37.968
because the present you is brave.

10:39.128 --> 10:40.464
The present you is hopeful.

10:40.488 --> 10:43.784
The present you
is innovative and resourceful,

10:43.808 --> 10:47.048
and of course, the present you
is annoyingly indefinable.

10:48.128 --> 10:49.768
And in this spell-binding,

10:50.608 --> 10:52.544
imperfect moment of existence,

10:52.568 --> 10:55.144
feeling a little brave
just before I came here,

10:55.168 --> 10:58.168
I decided to take
a good, hard look at my face.

10:59.488 --> 11:03.144
And I realized that I'm beginning
to look more and more

11:03.168 --> 11:05.584
like the wax statue of me
at Madame Tussaud's.

11:05.608 --> 11:07.863
(Laughter)

11:07.888 --> 11:10.384
Yeah, and in that moment of realization,

11:10.408 --> 11:14.648
I asked the most central
and pertinent question to humanity and me:

11:16.088 --> 11:17.968
Do I need to fix my face?

11:19.208 --> 11:22.544
Really. I'm an actor, like I told you,

11:22.568 --> 11:25.944
a modern expression of human creativity.

11:25.968 --> 11:27.503
The land I come from

11:27.528 --> 11:32.488
is the source of inexplicable
but very simple spirituality.

11:33.688 --> 11:35.367
In its immense generosity,

11:36.208 --> 11:38.944
India decided somehow

11:38.968 --> 11:42.944
that I, the Muslim son
of a broke freedom fighter

11:42.968 --> 11:46.808
who accidentally ventured
into the business of selling dreams,

11:47.728 --> 11:51.647
should become its king of romance,

11:52.648 --> 11:55.008
the "Badhshah of Bollywood,"

11:55.688 --> 11:58.448
the greatest lover
the country has ever seen ...

11:59.328 --> 12:00.528
with this face.

12:01.048 --> 12:02.264
Yeah.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.384
(Laughter)

12:03.408 --> 12:06.304
Which has alternately
been described as ugly, unconventional,

12:06.328 --> 12:08.144
and strangely, not chocolatey enough.

12:08.168 --> 12:11.048
(Laughter)

12:13.488 --> 12:15.824
The people of this ancient land

12:15.848 --> 12:18.264
embraced me in their limitless love,

12:18.288 --> 12:19.968
and I've learned from these people

12:20.848 --> 12:23.208
that neither power nor poverty

12:24.048 --> 12:25.744
can make your life more magical

12:25.768 --> 12:27.048
or less tortuous.

12:27.768 --> 12:30.384
I've learned from the people of my country

12:30.408 --> 12:32.504
that the dignity of a life,

12:32.528 --> 12:36.128
a human being, a culture,
a religion, a country

12:37.168 --> 12:39.048
actually resides in its ability

12:40.208 --> 12:41.648
for grace and compassion.

12:42.328 --> 12:44.408
I've learned that whatever moves you,

12:45.088 --> 12:47.784
whatever urges you to create, to build,

12:47.808 --> 12:49.464
whatever keeps you from failing,

12:49.488 --> 12:51.744
whatever helps you survive,

12:51.768 --> 12:56.144
is perhaps the oldest and the simplest
emotion known to mankind,

12:56.168 --> 12:58.048
and that is love.

12:59.328 --> 13:02.223
A mystic poet from my land famously wrote,

13:02.248 --> 13:03.414
(Recites poem in Hindi)

13:12.928 --> 13:14.584
(Poem ends)

13:14.608 --> 13:17.184
Which loosely translates
into that whatever --

13:17.208 --> 13:19.284
yeah, if you know Hindi,
please clap, yeah.

13:19.308 --> 13:20.744
(Applause)

13:20.768 --> 13:22.292
It's very difficult to remember.

13:23.248 --> 13:25.824
Which loosely translates
into actually saying

13:25.848 --> 13:28.304
that all the books of knowledge
that you might read

13:28.328 --> 13:31.223
and then go ahead
and impart your knowledge

13:31.248 --> 13:34.584
through innovation,
through creativity, through technology,

13:34.608 --> 13:37.743
but mankind will never be
the wiser about its future

13:37.768 --> 13:43.888
unless it is coupled with a sense of love
and compassion for their fellow beings.

13:44.528 --> 13:48.104
The two and a half alphabets
which form the word "प्रेम,"

13:48.128 --> 13:49.544
which means "love,"

13:49.568 --> 13:51.464
if you are able to understand that

13:51.488 --> 13:53.064
and practice it,

13:53.088 --> 13:56.288
that itself is enough
to enlighten mankind.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.008
So I truly believe the future "you"

13:59.968 --> 14:01.647
has to be a you that loves.

14:02.448 --> 14:04.488
Otherwise it will cease to flourish.

14:05.448 --> 14:08.808
It will perish in its own self-absorption.

14:10.328 --> 14:11.768
So you may use your power

14:12.488 --> 14:14.184
to build walls

14:14.208 --> 14:15.648
and keep people outside,

14:16.968 --> 14:20.767
or you may use it to break barriers
and welcome them in.

14:21.848 --> 14:23.623
You may use your faith

14:23.648 --> 14:25.088
to make people afraid

14:26.168 --> 14:27.928
and terrify them into submission,

14:29.048 --> 14:31.504
or you can use it
to give courage to people

14:31.528 --> 14:35.264
so they rise to the greatest
heights of enlightenment.

14:35.288 --> 14:37.224
You can use your energy

14:37.248 --> 14:40.584
to build nuclear bombs
and spread the darkness of destruction,

14:40.608 --> 14:44.367
or you can use it to spread
the joy of light to millions.

14:45.368 --> 14:49.384
You may filthy up the oceans callously
and cut down all the forests.

14:49.408 --> 14:51.824
You can destroy the ecology,

14:51.848 --> 14:54.024
or turn to them with love

14:54.048 --> 14:56.288
and regenerate life
from the waters and trees.

14:57.288 --> 14:59.064
You may land on Mars

14:59.088 --> 15:00.848
and build armed citadels,

15:02.488 --> 15:07.408
or you may look for life-forms and species
to learn from and respect.

15:08.248 --> 15:11.984
And you can use
all the moneys we all have earned

15:12.008 --> 15:13.568
to wage futile wars

15:14.928 --> 15:17.824
and give guns in the hands
of little children

15:17.848 --> 15:19.208
to kill each other with,

15:20.288 --> 15:21.488
or you can use it

15:22.248 --> 15:23.984
to make more food

15:24.008 --> 15:25.408
to fill their stomachs with.

15:26.488 --> 15:28.144
My country has taught me

15:28.168 --> 15:32.528
the capacity for a human being to love
is akin to godliness.

15:33.568 --> 15:38.024
It shines forth in a world

15:38.048 --> 15:43.128
which civilization, I think,
already has tampered too much with.

15:44.488 --> 15:47.224
In the last few days,
the talks here, the wonderful people

15:47.248 --> 15:48.984
coming and showing their talent,

15:49.008 --> 15:52.344
talking about individual achievements,
the innovation, the technology,

15:52.368 --> 15:55.704
the sciences, the knowledge
we are gaining by being here

15:55.728 --> 15:58.503
in the presence of TED Talks
and all of you

15:58.528 --> 16:01.544
are reasons enough
for us to celebrate the future "us."

16:01.568 --> 16:03.048
But within that celebration

16:04.208 --> 16:07.767
the quest to cultivate
our capacity for love and compassion

16:09.208 --> 16:12.247
has to assert itself,
has to assert itself,

16:12.968 --> 16:14.808
just as equally.

16:15.768 --> 16:18.008
So I believe the future "you"

16:18.848 --> 16:20.127
is an infinite you.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.608
It's called a chakra
in India, like a circle.

16:24.648 --> 16:27.488
It ends where it begins from
to complete itself.

16:28.888 --> 16:32.584
A you that perceives
time and space differently

16:32.608 --> 16:33.928
understands both

16:36.688 --> 16:40.008
your unimaginable

16:41.328 --> 16:43.744
and fantastic importance

16:43.768 --> 16:49.368
and your complete unimportance
in the larger context of the universe.

16:50.488 --> 16:51.968
A you that returns back

16:52.768 --> 16:54.624
to the original innocence of humanity,

16:54.648 --> 16:56.728
which loves from the purity of heart,

16:57.568 --> 16:59.888
which sees from the eyes of truth,

17:01.128 --> 17:06.728
which dreams from the clarity
of an untampered mind.

17:08.088 --> 17:09.407
The future "you" has to be

17:10.367 --> 17:11.927
like an aging movie star

17:12.887 --> 17:15.823
who has been made to believe
that there is a possibility

17:15.848 --> 17:18.623
of a world which is completely,

17:18.647 --> 17:21.664
wholly, self-obsessively

17:21.688 --> 17:22.888
in love with itself.

17:23.767 --> 17:27.064
A world -- really, it has to be a you

17:27.088 --> 17:29.024
to create a world

17:29.047 --> 17:30.848
which is its own best lover.

17:31.848 --> 17:33.664
That I believe, ladies and gentlemen,

17:33.688 --> 17:35.224
should be the future "you."

17:35.247 --> 17:36.704
Thank you very much.

17:36.728 --> 17:37.944
Shukriya.

17:37.968 --> 17:40.103
(Applause)

17:40.128 --> 17:41.342
Thank you.

17:41.368 --> 17:44.303
(Applause)

17:44.328 --> 17:45.584
Thank you.

17:45.608 --> 17:48.207
(Applause)
