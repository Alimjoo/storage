05:21.260 --> 05:23.080
-是1978年  -不  比利
- It's 1978. - No, Billy,

05:23.080 --> 05:25.410
《如此美好》虽然是1978年登上榜单的
while Feels So Good may have charted in 1978,

05:25.410 --> 05:29.210
但专辑是1977年12月发行的
the album was released in December, 1977.

05:29.210 --> 05:31.790
-不  维基上说是197...  -再看看

05:31.850 --> 05:34.270
这些无用的信息你都储存在哪啊
Where do you store all this useless information?

05:34.270 --> 05:37.700
无用  他单靠粗管短号就能上前十热曲榜
Useless? The man charted a top ten hit with a Flugelhorn.

05:38.270 --> 05:40.490
-怎么样  比利  -1977年
- Status, Billy? - 1977.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.230

Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

05:59.910 --> 06:01.280

06:01.280 --> 06:03.910
我好像发现问题所在了  帕尔默医生
I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.340
你把一颗子弹留在了他的脑子里
You left a bullet in his head.

06:05.340 --> 06:07.180
谢谢  它撞到了髓质
Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

06:07.180 --> 06:09.860
我需要专家意见  尼克已经判了脑死亡
I needed a specialist. Nic diagnose brain death.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.950
但我就是觉得不对劲
Something about that doesn't feel right to me.

06:11.950 --> 06:12.900
我们得跑了
We have to run.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.480
韦斯特医生  你在做什么
Dr. West! What are you doing?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.340
器官采集  他是捐献者
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

06:18.350 --> 06:19.990
别急  我可没同意
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

06:19.990 --> 06:22.180
我不需要你同意  我们已经判定脑死亡了
I don't need you to. We've already called brain death.

06:22.180 --> 06:22.850
话说早了
Prematurely.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.710
得为他准备进行枕下开颅手术
We need to get him prepped for sub-occipital craniotomy.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.390
我不会让你给死人开刀的
Not gonna let you operate on a dead man.

06:26.390 --> 06:27.260
你看到了什么
What do you see?

06:28.150 --> 06:30.150
-一颗子弹  -一颗完好的子弹
- A bullet? - A perfect bullet.

06:30.150 --> 06:30.940
子弹加固过
It's been hardened.

06:30.940 --> 06:33.070
子弹加固是用铅锑合金
You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.260
有毒金属
A toxic metal.

06:34.260 --> 06:37.030
而且子弹直接接触脑脊液
And that's leeched directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.090
立刻造成中枢神经系统停摆
Rapid-onset central nervous system shutdown.

06:39.100 --> 06:39.680
我们得走了
We got to go.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.850
病人没死  但他要死了
The patient's not dead, but he's dying.

06:40.850 --> 06:42.510
还要采集他的器官吗
Still want to harvest his organs?

06:43.700 --> 06:44.570
我来协助你
I'll assist you.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.190
不用  帕尔默医生会协助我的

07:13.560 --> 07:14.910
没那个时间了

07:15.800 --> 07:16.970
你不能直接用手做
You can't do it freehand.

07:16.970 --> 07:17.910
我能  我就要这么做
I can and I will.

07:17.910 --> 07:20.290
这不是炫耀的时候  斯特兰奇
This isn't a time for showing off, Strange.

07:20.290 --> 07:21.270
那十分钟前
How about ten minutes ago,

07:21.270 --> 07:23.200
你错判了死亡时间时呢
when you called the wrong time of death?

07:32.480 --> 07:34.250
颅神经未受损
Cranial nerves intact.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.510
韦斯特医生  盖住你的表
Dr. West, cover your watch.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.250
你没必要当着众人的面羞辱他的
You know, you didn't have to humiliate him in front of everyone.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.330
我还没必要救他的病人呢  但是嘛...
I didn't have to save his patient, either. But, you know, I

08:49.330 --> 08:51.620
我有时候就是忍不住
sometimes just can't help myself.

08:51.620 --> 08:54.110
-尼克是个好医生  -你来找我了
- Nic is a great doctor. - You came to me.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.690
我想听听别人的意见
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

08:55.690 --> 08:56.910
你已经听到了
You had a second opinion.

08:56.910 --> 08:58.470
你想听到好的意见
What you needed was a competent one.

08:58.470 --> 09:00.970
所以你更该当我的待命神经外科医生了
Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.

09:00.970 --> 09:02.290
你可以做出很大贡献
You could make such a difference.

09:02.290 --> 09:04.270
我不能在你的屠宰场工作
I can't work in your butcher shop.

09:04.270 --> 09:06.080
我在做截断脊髓熔合术
Look, I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.480
以及刺激中枢神经的神经发生
I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.440
我的工作在今后的年月里能拯救上千人
The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.650
而在急诊室  至多就是救拿枪的笨蛋醉鬼
In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.950
是啊  我们急诊室的人不过就是在救命
Yeah, you're right. In ER, we're only saving lives.

09:15.950 --> 09:19.470
捞不到名声  没有CNN来采访
There's no fame, there's no CNN interviews...

09:19.710 --> 09:21.650
那我只能继续用尼克了
Well, I guess I'll have to stick with Nic.

09:21.650 --> 09:24.250
等等  你们不是...你俩没...
Oh, wait a minute. You're not... you guys aren't...

09:24.250 --> 09:25.050

What?

09:25.250 --> 09:26.240
上床吧
Sleeping together.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.250
抱歉  我以为我厌恶的口气能暗示我的意思了
Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.650
其实非常明显
Explicit, actually.

09:29.650 --> 09:32.410
没有  我有绝对不能跟同事约会的规矩

09:34.250 --> 09:37.360
太棒了  很高兴有东西是以我命名的
Oh, good! I'm glad something's named after me.

09:37.690 --> 09:39.250
我发明了一种椎板切除术手术
You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure,

09:39.250 --> 09:39.990
但不知为何
and yet, somehow,

09:39.990 --> 09:42.270
似乎没人愿意管它叫"斯特兰奇术"
no one seems to want to call it the Strange technique.

09:42.270 --> 09:44.010
是我们一起发明了那个术式
We invented that technique.

09:44.010 --> 09:47.280
不管怎样  你的准则让我受宠若惊
You know, regardless, I'm very flattered by your policy.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.370
那不是以我们为主  是以你为主
They weren't about us, they were about you.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.510
也不仅仅是我
Not only about me.

10:05.510 --> 10:08.220
斯蒂芬  什么事都是以你为中心的
Stephen. Everything is about you.

17:25.190 --> 17:27.970
还有其他事能让你的生命富有意义
There are other things that can give your life meaning.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.800
什么  你吗
Like what? Like you?

17:32.440 --> 17:34.590
你现在该道歉了
And this is the part where you apologize.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.470
你现在该走了
This is the part where you leave.

17:37.860 --> 17:40.340
好吧  我也看不下去你再这么折磨自己了
Fine. I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore.

17:40.340 --> 17:42.790
-太艰难了  是吗  -没错
- Too difficult for you, is it? - Yes.

17:42.990 --> 17:43.980
是的
It is.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.150
看到你这样令我心碎
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

17:46.150 --> 17:47.050
不  别可怜我
No. Don't pity me.

17:47.060 --> 17:48.150
我不是在可怜你
I'm not pitying you.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.380
是吗  那你为什么来
Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here?

17:49.380 --> 17:50.430
带奶酪和酒来
Bringing cheese and wine

17:50.430 --> 17:52.010
好像我们是去吃野餐的老朋友
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

17:52.010 --> 17:53.580
我们不是朋友  克里斯汀
We are not friends, Christine.

17:53.580 --> 17:54.920
我们连情人都算不上
We were barely lovers.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.960
你就喜欢悲剧故事  是吧
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

17:56.960 --> 17:58.150
你现在就这么看我了吗
Is that what I am to you now?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.810
可怜的斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇  施舍对象
Poor Stephen Strange, charity case.

18:00.810 --> 18:01.790
他终于需要我了
He finally needs me.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.130
又一个你可以拯救的人性渣滓
Another dreg of humanity for you to work on.

18:04.130 --> 18:06.380
把他包扎好  让他重新回归社会
Patch him up and send him back into the world,

18:06.380 --> 18:07.910
心里简直要唱起歌
hearts just humming...

18:07.920 --> 18:11.560
你非常在乎  是吧
You care so much! Don't you?!

18:15.790 --> 18:17.060
再见  斯蒂芬
Goodbye, Stephen.

18:24.120 --> 18:28.120
斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇

18:51.480 --> 18:54.770
<b>我说的吧</b>

19:01.070 --> 19:03.030
<b>乔·潘伯恩</b>

19:13.360 --> 19:15.220
拜托  拿出点真本事来啊
Come on, man! Where is the competition?

19:16.920 --> 19:18.000
你话真多
Talk a lot!

19:19.820 --> 19:24.110
乔纳森·潘伯恩  C7-C8脊椎完全性损伤
Jonathan Pangborn, C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

19:24.950 --> 19:26.930
-你是谁  -胸部以下瘫痪
- Who are you? - Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.830
双手部分瘫痪
Partial paralysis in both hands.

19:28.830 --> 19:29.760
我不认识你
I don't know you.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.130
我是斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇
I'm Stephen Strange.

19:31.130 --> 19:34.010
是个神经外科医生  曾经是
I'm a neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.460
你知道吗  我还真认识你
Actually, you know what, man? I do know you.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.700
我曾经去过你办公室  你拒绝见我
I came to your office once. You refused to see me.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.800
我连你助理那关都没过
I never got past your assistant.

19:44.190 --> 19:45.830
你当时没法医治
You were untreatable.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.920
治不好就得不到荣誉  是吧
No glory for you in that, right?

19:50.080 --> 19:53.050
你从万劫不复的病情中康复了
You came back from a place there's no way back from!

19:56.630 --> 19:58.830
我也想找到我的康复之路
I'm trying to find my own way back.

20:01.810 --> 20:03.720
潘伯恩  你还打不打了
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

20:10.990 --> 20:12.100
好吧
All right.

20:14.450 --> 20:16.370
我本来都放弃我的身体了
I'd given up on my body.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.070
我以为我只剩下思维了
I thought my mind's the only thing I had left.

20:19.070 --> 20:21.010
至少也该努力提升它一下
I should at least try to elevate that.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.360
所以我去见大师
So I sat with gurus,

20:23.730 --> 20:25.130
还有圣女
and sacred women.

20:25.630 --> 20:28.620
陌生人抬着我上山顶去见圣人
Strangers carried me to mountain tops to see holy men.

20:28.660 --> 20:31.810
最终  我找到了我的导师
And finally, I found my teacher.

20:32.570 --> 20:34.530
我的思维得到了提升
And my mind was elevated.

20:35.390 --> 20:37.100
灵魂得到了深化
And my spirit deepened.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.600
-不知如何  -你的身体痊愈了
- And somehow... - Your body healed.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.610
是啊
Yes.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.440
还有更深奥的秘密等着我学习
And there were deeper secrets to learn there,

20:44.440 --> 20:46.460
但我没有体力去接受了
but I didn't have the strength to receive them.

20:46.630 --> 20:49.700
我安于我的奇迹  回家来了
I chose to settle for my miracle, and I came back home.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.340
你找的地方叫卡马塔奇
The place you're looking for is called Kamar-Taj.

20:57.940 --> 21:00.750
-但那里代价[价格]很高  -多少钱
- But the cost there is high. - How much?

21:01.200 --> 21:02.890
我指的不是钱
I'm not talking about money.

21:05.010 --> 21:06.070
祝你好运
Good luck.

21:08.440 --> 21:11.120
玩球吧  来啊
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

21:15.080 --> 21:17.330
<b>尼泊尔  加德满都</b>

21:29.630 --> 21:30.940
不好意思  打扰一下
Excuse me. Excuse me.

21:31.510 --> 21:33.000
卡马塔奇
Kamar-Taj?

21:33.040 --> 21:34.980
你知道卡马塔奇在哪吗
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

21:48.030 --> 21:51.200
<b>找到安宁  找到自己</b>

21:59.360 --> 22:00.740
卡马塔奇
Kamar-Taj?

22:02.040 --> 22:03.400
卡马塔奇
Kamar-Taj...

22:32.290 --> 22:33.590
好吧
Okay.

22:35.910 --> 22:38.810
伙计们  我没有钱
Look guys, I... I don't have any money.

22:39.010 --> 22:40.030
你的手表
Your watch.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.400
不  求你们了
No, please.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.620
-我只剩这个了  -你的手表
- It's all I have left. - Your watch.

22:47.840 --> 22:48.930
好吧
All right.

23:29.430 --> 23:31.030
你在找卡马塔奇
You're looking for Kamar-Taj?

24:01.960 --> 24:02.910
真的吗
Really?

24:03.360 --> 24:04.930
你确定找对地方了吗
Sure you got the right place?

24:06.120 --> 24:07.580
那里看起来更...
That one looks a little more...

24:08.140 --> 24:09.950
卡马塔奇一些
Kamar Taj-y.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.420
我曾经和你一样
I once stood in your place.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.260
我也曾经...
And I, too, was...

24:17.280 --> 24:18.560
很不敬
disrespectful.

24:19.710 --> 24:21.580
我给你点建议
So might I offer you some advice?

24:22.940 --> 24:24.810
忘掉你自以为知道的一切
Forget everything you think you know.

24:27.770 --> 24:29.350
好吧
All right.

24:38.630 --> 24:40.440
这圣殿属于我们的导师
The sanctuary of our teacher.

24:41.270 --> 24:42.610
古一法师
The Ancient One.

24:42.860 --> 24:45.620
古一法师  他真名叫什么
The Ancient One? What's his real name?

24:47.340 --> 24:50.980
对了  忘掉我自以为知道的一切  抱歉
Right. Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

25:02.010 --> 25:03.280
感谢你...
Thank you for...

25:05.710 --> 25:07.730
好吧  这是...规矩吗
Okay, that's, uh... a thing...

25:08.700 --> 25:10.070
谢谢
Thank you for...

25:10.400 --> 25:11.380
你好
Hello.

25:11.870 --> 25:12.990
谢谢
Uh, thank you.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.160
也谢谢你
And thank you.

25:15.620 --> 25:20.350
感谢你  古一法师  愿意见我
Uh, thank you, Ancient One... for... seeing me...

25:20.560 --> 25:21.950
不客气
You're very welcome.

25:25.330 --> 25:27.450
-古一法师  -谢谢  莫多法师
- The Ancient One. - Thank you, Master Mordo.

25:27.450 --> 25:29.090
谢谢  哈密尔法师
Thank you, Master Hamir!

25:29.530 --> 25:30.820
斯特兰奇先生
Mr. Strange!

25:31.910 --> 25:33.550
其实是博士
Doctor, actually.

25:33.550 --> 25:36.210
肯定不再是了
Well, no. Not anymore, surely.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.620
你不正是因此而来的吗
Isn't that why you're here?

25:37.960 --> 25:39.790
你做了许多次手术
You've undergone many procedures.

25:39.790 --> 25:42.180
-七次  对吧  -对
- Seven, right? - Yeah...

25:43.040 --> 25:46.270
-好茶  -是啊
- It's good tea. - Yes.

25:50.350 --> 25:54.560
你是不是治好了一个叫潘伯恩的人  他瘫痪了
Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man.

25:54.560 --> 25:55.620
算是吧
In a way.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.540
你帮了他  他又能走了
You helped him to walk again.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.010
对
Yes.

25:59.020 --> 26:02.830
你是怎么治好C7-C8脊椎完全性损伤的
How did you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

26:02.830 --> 26:04.270
不是治好了
I didn't correct it.

26:04.820 --> 26:07.710
他不能走  我让他相信他能
He couldn't walk; I convinced him that he could.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.620
你不是指身心治疗吧
You're not suggesting it was psychosomatic?

26:09.620 --> 26:11.670
你把断掉的神经接好后
When you reattach a severed nerve,

26:11.670 --> 26:14.330
是你  还是身体让它痊愈
is it you who heals it back together or the body?

26:14.330 --> 26:16.730
-是细胞  -而细胞被设定好
- It's the cells. - And the cells are only programmed

26:16.730 --> 26:19.240
以特定的方式来痊愈
to put themselves back together in very specific ways.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.110
对
Right.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.960
如果我告诉你  你可以说服身体相信
What if I told you that your own body could be convinced

26:22.960 --> 26:26.470
它能以各种各样的方式痊愈呢
to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?

26:27.050 --> 26:29.960
你是说细胞再生
You're talking about cellular regeneration.

26:30.200 --> 26:33.100
这种技术非常尖端
That's... bleeding-edge medical tech.

26:33.100 --> 26:34.310
所以你才在这里工作吗
Is that why you're working here,

26:34.310 --> 26:36.660
脱离医院董事会的监管
without a governing medical board? I mean...

26:36.770 --> 26:38.850
你的治疗方法实验性多强
just how experimental is your treatment?

26:40.060 --> 26:41.050
非常强
Quite.

26:41.970 --> 26:47.140
所以  你有办法让神经细胞重组自愈吗
So, you've figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

26:47.440 --> 26:48.950
不  斯特兰奇先生
No, Mr. Strange.

26:50.030 --> 26:54.400
我知道如何调整精神力量  使身体更好地愈合
I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body.

26:56.150 --> 26:57.800
精神力量...愈合身体
The spirit... to heal the body.

26:57.800 --> 26:58.820
没错
That's right.

27:01.290 --> 27:03.060
好吧
No. Al... Al... All right.

27:03.060 --> 27:05.380
我们要怎么做  从哪开始
How do we do that? Where do we start?

27:11.340 --> 27:12.430
不喜欢那张图吗
Don't like that map?

27:12.430 --> 27:13.950
不是的  它真的很不错
Oh, no. It's... it's really good.

27:13.950 --> 27:16.080
只是...我以前见过这个
It's just... you know, I've seen it before.

27:16.780 --> 27:18.190
在礼品店里
In gift shops.

27:19.540 --> 27:20.820
那这张呢
And what about this one?

27:21.680 --> 27:23.650
-针灸  厉害  -是吧
- Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?

27:24.930 --> 27:26.610
那张怎么样
What about... that one?

27:26.610 --> 27:29.910
你是在给我看核磁共振图吗  难以置信
Showing me an MRI scan? I do not believe this.

27:29.970 --> 27:33.830
画每张图的人  都只能窥视局部
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part,

27:33.860 --> 27:35.030
而看不到全局
but not the whole.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.820
我为来这儿  花了最后的一点钱
I spent my last dollar getting here

27:36.940 --> 27:37.610
买了张单程票
one-way ticket,

27:37.610 --> 27:41.050
你却在跟我说信仰治疗
and you're talking to me about healing through belief?

27:41.050 --> 27:43.540
你是一个通过钥匙孔窥视世界的人
You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole,

27:43.550 --> 27:46.420
你这一生  都在试图扩大那个钥匙孔
you've spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole.

27:46.550 --> 27:48.410
想看到更多  知道更多
To see more, to know more.

27:48.470 --> 27:51.320
而如今听闻  这钥匙孔可以扩大
And now, on hearing that it can be widen

27:51.550 --> 27:54.790
是以你无法想象的方式  你却抗拒这个可能性吗
in ways you can't imagine, you reject the possibility?

27:54.790 --> 27:57.480
不  我拒绝是因为我不信天方夜谭
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales

27:57.480 --> 28:01.020
什么脉轮  能量  信仰的力量
about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief.

28:01.020 --> 28:03.550
根本没有精神力量这东西
There is no such thing as spirit!

28:04.020 --> 28:07.110
我们都由物质构成  别无他物
We are made of matter, and nothing more.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.910
你只是一粒小小的  转瞬即逝的尘埃
You're just another tiny, momentary speck

28:09.910 --> 28:11.730
漂浮在这冷漠的世界里
within an indifferent universe.

28:11.730 --> 28:13.040
你太妄自菲薄了
You think too little of yourself.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.200
你自以为能看穿我  是吗
You think you see through me, do you?

28:15.200 --> 28:16.340
你才不能呢
Well, you don't.

28:16.890 --> 28:19.720
我倒是看穿你了
But I see through you!!

28:37.480 --> 28:38.750
你刚对我做了什么
What did you just do to me?!

28:38.750 --> 28:41.050
我将你的魂体打出了你的肉体
I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.

28:41.050 --> 28:42.150
那杯茶里加了什么
What's in that tea?

28:42.870 --> 28:44.610
裸头草碱[迷幻药]  还是迷幻剂
Psilocybin? LSD?

28:44.710 --> 28:45.760
就是茶
It's just tea.

28:46.580 --> 28:47.760
加了一点蜂蜜
With a little honey.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.250
刚发生了什么
What just happened?

28:49.250 --> 28:52.370
那一瞬间  你进入了精神次元
For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.

28:52.370 --> 28:56.130
-什么  -魂魄与躯壳不共生的地方
- The what? - A place where the soul exists apart from the body.

28:56.130 --> 28:57.930
你为什么要这样对我
Why are you doing this to me?

28:58.040 --> 29:00.470
为了让你明白你有多无知
To show you just how much you don't know.

29:01.630 --> 29:03.550
睁开你的眼睛
Open your eye.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.190
该死
Shit!

29:10.190 --> 29:11.990
上帝啊  上帝啊
Oh god! Oh god!

29:11.990 --> 29:14.170
不不不不不
No. No. No. No. No. No.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.270
怎么回事
What's happening?

29:15.270 --> 29:16.260
这不是真的  不是真的
This isn't real. This isn't real.

29:16.260 --> 29:17.810
不是真的  这是...
This isn't real. This is...

29:23.330 --> 29:24.170
上帝啊
Oh god!

29:24.180 --> 29:26.310
不不不不不
No. No. No. No. No. No.

29:29.070 --> 29:31.200
他的心率太高  有点危险
His heart rate is getting dangerously high.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.980
我看他挺好的
He looks all right to me.

29:40.050 --> 29:42.740
你自以为明白这世界如何运转
You think you know how the world works?

29:43.040 --> 29:46.830
你以为这物质宇宙就是全部了吗
You think that this material universe is all there is?

29:51.100 --> 29:52.760
何为真实
What is real?

29:54.540 --> 29:58.380
你感官无法触及之处  还有怎样的奥秘
What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses?

30:00.400 --> 30:05.320
在万物存在的根源处  思维与物质交合
At the root of existence, mind and matter meet.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.800
思维塑造现实
Thoughts shape reality.

30:21.730 --> 30:25.440
这个宇宙不过无数个宇宙之一
This universe is only one of an infinite number.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.810
无尽的世界
Worlds without end.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.400
有些世界充满仁爱与生命
Some benevolent and life-giving;

30:35.930 --> 30:39.650
有些则满是恶念与饥荒
Others filled with malice and hunger.

30:42.350 --> 30:47.800
还有黑暗之地  存在着比时间更古老的力量
Dark places, where powers older than time lie...

30:48.050 --> 30:49.360
贪婪地
ravenous...

30:50.060 --> 30:51.420
等待着
and waiting.

30:59.150 --> 31:03.030
在浩瀚的多元宇宙间  你是谁
Who are you in this vast multiverse,

31:04.060 --> 31:05.610
斯特兰奇先生
Mr. Strange?

31:25.340 --> 31:27.770
你在礼品店见过这个吗
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

31:35.450 --> 31:36.600
教教我
Teach me!

31:39.500 --> 31:40.490
不
No.

31:46.140 --> 31:47.110
不...
No...

31:47.460 --> 31:48.360
不要
No!

31:48.370 --> 31:50.740
不不不不  不要
No, no, no, no no no no!

31:52.730 --> 31:56.430
不要  开门  求你了
No! Open the door! Please!

31:59.490 --> 32:00.880
谢谢  各位法师
Thank you, Masters.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.940
你觉得我不该赶他走吗
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

32:08.280 --> 32:10.750
五小时了  他还在你门口
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

32:11.850 --> 32:13.400
他身上有股力量
There's a strength to him.

32:13.520 --> 32:18.440
顽固  自负  野心...我都见过
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition... I've seen it all before.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.770
他让你想起了卡西利亚斯吗
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

32:21.110 --> 32:24.120
我不能再教另一个天赋异禀的学生学会强大法术
I cannot lead another gifted student to power,

32:24.120 --> 32:26.260
再看着他被黑暗吞噬
only to lose him to the darkness.

32:28.490 --> 32:29.830
我就没有那样
You didn't lose me.

32:30.690 --> 32:32.630
我想获得力量  打败敌人
I wanted the power to defeat my enemies.

32:32.630 --> 32:36.210
你给了我力量打败心魔
You gave me the power to defeat my demons.

32:36.470 --> 32:39.560
并遵守自然法则
And to live within the natural law.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.040
我们永远不能摆脱心魔  莫多
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

32:42.770 --> 32:45.240
我们只能学会抑制它们
We only learn to live above them.

32:47.380 --> 32:50.130
被偷的几页书还在卡西利亚斯手上
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.780
如果他成功破解  就能毁灭我们所有人
If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin upon us all.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.060
黑暗的日子可能就要到来
There may be dark days ahead.

32:57.700 --> 33:00.580
卡马塔奇或许用得上斯特兰奇这样的人
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.350
别把我挡在外面
Don't shut me out.

33:15.350 --> 33:17.640
我没别的地方可去了
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

33:22.720 --> 33:23.730
谢谢
Thank you.

33:28.950 --> 33:29.980
洗澡
Bathe.

33:31.100 --> 33:32.040
休息
Rest.

33:33.260 --> 33:34.340
或是冥想
Meditate...

33:34.920 --> 33:35.930
如果你可以的话
if you can.

33:36.850 --> 33:38.750
古一法师会派人来找你的
The Ancient One will send for you.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.940
这是什么  我的咒语吗
What's this? My mantra?

33:50.580 --> 33:51.980
是无线网密码
The Wi-Fi password.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.940
我们又不是野蛮人
We're not savages.

34:14.860 --> 34:20.450
时间会表明
我爱你多深
~
克里斯汀

34:27.000 --> 34:31.450
魔法的语言和人类文明一样古老
The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.800
古代的法师
The sorcerers of antiquity

34:34.340 --> 34:36.950
把这种语言的使用称为"咒语"
called the use of this language "Spells".

34:37.390 --> 34:39.520
但如果这个词有违你的现代思维
But if that word offends your modern sensibilities,

34:39.520 --> 34:41.850
你可以把它称作"程序"
you can call it a "Program".

34:42.450 --> 34:45.090
它是塑造了现实的源代码
The source code that shapes reality.

34:45.740 --> 34:47.700
我们汲取能量
We harness energy

34:49.350 --> 34:52.360
来自多元宇宙其他次元的能量
drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse,

34:53.870 --> 34:55.500
来施咒
to cast spells,

34:57.270 --> 34:59.530
变出护盾
to conjure shields

35:00.180 --> 35:01.380
和武器
and weapons

35:03.070 --> 35:05.110
创造魔法
to make magic.

35:17.740 --> 35:18.750
但是
But...

35:19.040 --> 35:22.340
即使我的手指可以做到
even if my fingers could do that,

35:23.050 --> 35:26.110
我的手也只是在胡乱挥舞而已
my hands would just be waving in the air. I mean,

35:26.110 --> 35:28.320
我怎么才能达到你那种程度呢
how do I get from here to there?

35:28.500 --> 35:32.010
那你是如何能连接断裂的神经
How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and

35:32.010 --> 35:34.840
一节一节地修复人的脊椎呢
put a human spine back together bone by bone?

35:34.840 --> 35:37.320
多年的学习和练习
Study and practice. Years of it.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.150
-斯特兰奇先生  -叫我斯蒂芬就好
- Mr. Strange. - Stephen, please.

35:54.090 --> 35:56.030
-那你是  -王
- And you are? - Wong.

35:56.030 --> 35:56.980
王
Wong.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.870
就单一个王吗
Just Wong?

35:59.190 --> 36:00.730
就像  阿黛尔
Like... Adele?

36:02.840 --> 36:04.680
或者  亚里士多德
Or... Aristotle.

36:06.280 --> 36:07.290
德雷克
Drake.

36:07.810 --> 36:08.810
博诺
Bono.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.350
阿姆
Eminem.

36:16.170 --> 36:18.130
《幻日之书》
The Book of the Invisible Sun.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.450
《新天文学》
Astronomia Nova.

36:21.060 --> 36:22.700
《统御法典》
Codex Imperium.

36:23.090 --> 36:24.480
《所罗门钥匙》
Key of Solomon.

36:26.890 --> 36:29.090
-你全都看完了吗  -对
- You finished all of this? - Yup.

36:30.340 --> 36:32.490
-跟我来  -好
- Come with me. - All right.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.750
这个区域仅对法师开放
This section is for Masters only.

36:35.750 --> 36:38.150
但如果有我的允许  其他人也可以看
But at my discretion, others may use it.

36:39.350 --> 36:41.520
从《马克西姆的启蒙》开始看吧
We should start with Maxim's Primer.

36:44.910 --> 36:46.470
你的梵文怎么样
How's your Sanskrit?

36:47.260 --> 36:49.700
我谷歌翻译用得挺溜
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.100
吠陀  古典梵语
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

36:57.310 --> 36:58.480
那些是什么
What are those?

36:59.320 --> 37:01.460
古一法师的私人收藏
The Ancient One's private collection.

37:01.990 --> 37:03.370
所以禁止阅览吗
So they're forbidden?

37:03.790 --> 37:06.010
卡马塔奇没有禁止阅览的知识
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.

37:06.010 --> 37:07.700
只有个别禁施的法术
Only certain practices.

37:08.670 --> 37:10.450
除了至尊法师
Those books are far too advanced

37:10.460 --> 37:13.000
那些书对其他人来说太过深奥
for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.930
这本书有缺页
This one's got pages missing.

37:27.210 --> 37:30.600
那是《卡里奥斯特罗之书》  是研究时间的
That's the Book of Cagliostro. A study of time.

37:31.210 --> 37:34.370
一个前法师偷走了一个法事
One of the rituals was stolen by a former Master.

37:35.270 --> 37:37.570
是个狂热信徒  叫卡西利亚斯
The zealot, Kaecilius.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.150
他还把前任图书管理员吊了起来
Just after he strung up the former librarian,

37:42.600 --> 37:44.360
并砍下了他的首级
and relieved him of his head.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.250
现在我来守卫这些书
I am now the guardian of these books.

37:49.610 --> 37:52.930
所以如果再有一本藏书被偷
So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again,

37:53.270 --> 37:54.570
我都会知道
I'd know it.

37:54.880 --> 37:58.140
你还不及离开这里就会没命
And you'd be dead before you ever left the compound.

38:01.340 --> 38:03.850
那如果只是逾期了呢
What if it's just overdue? You know?

38:03.980 --> 38:06.840
会有什么逾期费吗  打个伤残什么的
Any... late fees I should know about? Maiming, perhaps.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.800
知道吗  以前大家都觉得我很幽默呢
You know, people used to think that I was funny.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.130
他们是你的手下吗
Did they work for you?

38:14.310 --> 38:16.400
好吧  跟你谈话真愉快
All right. Well, it's been lovely talking to you,

38:16.400 --> 38:20.180
谢谢你给我找书  给我讲恐怖故事
thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and

38:20.570 --> 38:22.190
并对我进行人身威胁
for the threat upon my life.

38:53.780 --> 38:57.380
现在我们将得到力量消灭背叛我们的人
We will now receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us.

38:59.990 --> 39:01.740
也是背叛世界的人
The one who betrays the world.

40:01.520 --> 40:05.200
掌握悬戒是学习魔法必不可少的
Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts.

40:05.570 --> 40:08.610
悬戒让我们可以在多元宇宙中穿行
They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.880
你所要做的就是集中精神
All you need to do is focus.

40:11.430 --> 40:12.600
去想象
Visualize.

40:13.210 --> 40:15.400
在脑海中勾勒出目的地
See the destination in your mind.

40:16.670 --> 40:18.930
目光超越你面前的世界
Look beyond the world in front of you.

40:20.370 --> 40:22.740
想象出每个细节
Imagine every detail.

40:23.560 --> 40:27.280
画面越清晰  召唤传送门就会
The clearer the picture, the quicker, and easier,

40:28.150 --> 40:29.600
越快  越容易
the gateway will come.

40:33.380 --> 40:34.450
停下
And stop.

40:34.950 --> 40:37.420
我想和斯特兰奇先生单独谈谈
I would like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.

40:38.350 --> 40:39.290
没问题
Of course.

40:43.410 --> 40:45.840
-都怪我的手  -这和你的手无关
- My hands. - It's not about your hands.

40:45.840 --> 40:48.050
这怎么会和我的手无关
How is this not about my hands?

40:48.170 --> 40:49.450
哈密尔法师
Master Hamir.

41:03.850 --> 41:05.460
有劳了  哈密尔法师
Thank you, Master Hamir.

41:06.550 --> 41:08.920
你无法打得河流服从你
You cannot beat a river into submission.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.810
你得顺应它的流势
You have to surrender to its current,

41:11.810 --> 41:13.780
化其力量为己用
and use its power as your own.

41:13.780 --> 41:16.520
我要放弃掌控  才能掌控它吗
I... I control it by surrendering control?

41:16.520 --> 41:17.660
那根本没道理啊
That doesn't make any sense.

41:17.660 --> 41:20.460
并非凡事都有道理  也并非都必须有道理
Not everything does. Not everything has to.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.850
你的智力引领了你的人生
Your intellect has taken you far in life.

41:23.850 --> 41:25.530
但它不会让你更进一步了
But it will take you no further.

41:25.930 --> 41:27.590
顺从吧  斯蒂芬
Surrender, Stephen.

41:28.220 --> 41:29.740
放下你的自负
Silence your ego

41:30.520 --> 41:32.270
你的力量才会显现
and your power will rise.

41:33.050 --> 41:34.040
跟我来
Come with me.

41:39.610 --> 41:42.680
-等等  这是不是...  -珠穆朗玛峰
- Wait. Is this... - Everest.

41:44.300 --> 41:46.930
-真美  -没错
- Beautiful. - Yeah, right.

41:47.180 --> 41:50.510
很美  很冷  但...很美
Beautiful. Freezing, but... beautiful.

41:50.650 --> 41:54.260
在这种温度下  人只能存活30分钟
At this temperature, a person can last for 30 minutes

41:54.260 --> 41:57.770
-然后就会永久丧失身体机能  -太好了
- before suffering permanent loss of function. - Great.

41:57.790 --> 42:00.860
但前两分钟内你大概就会休克
But you'll likely go into shock within the first 2.

42:02.170 --> 42:02.670
什么
What?

42:02.670 --> 42:06.330
-顺从吧  斯蒂芬  -不不  不要
- Surrender, Stephen. - No, no!!! Don't!

42:15.160 --> 42:17.990
-新来的怎么样了  -即将见分晓
- How's our new recruit? - We shall see.

42:19.190 --> 42:20.750
随时了
Any second now.

42:23.010 --> 42:24.240
不会吧  又来
No, not again.

42:29.620 --> 42:30.690
或许我该...
Maybe I should...

43:45.070 --> 43:46.910
-斯蒂芬  -王
- Stephen. - Wong.

43:46.990 --> 43:49.680
-你要什么  斯特兰奇  -魂体投射的书
- What do you want, Strange? - Books on astral projection.

43:50.650 --> 43:53.940
-你还没准备好  -放马过来  碧昂斯
- You're not ready for that. - Try me, Beyonce.

43:56.920 --> 44:00.330
得了  你听说过她吧  她可是大腕啊
Come on. You've heard of her. She's a huge star, right?

44:02.900 --> 44:04.070
你笑过吗
Do you ever laugh?

44:05.420 --> 44:06.820
得了  把书给我吧
Come on, just give me the book.

44:07.780 --> 44:08.910
不行
No.

44:36.320 --> 44:40.260
就在这个房间  你曾求我教你
Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn.

44:40.980 --> 44:43.280
如今我却听说  你质疑所有教导
Now I'm told you question every lesson,

44:43.280 --> 44:44.960
而更喜欢自学
prefering to teach yourself.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.120
就在这个房间  你曾要我睁开眼睛
Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes.

44:47.120 --> 44:50.870
如今我却听说  要盲目遵守毫无道理的规矩
Now I'm being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense.

44:50.910 --> 44:54.050
比如不能在图书馆里开传送门吗
Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?

44:54.050 --> 44:55.250
王打我小报告
Wong told on me?

44:55.250 --> 44:57.600
你的魔法法术进步很快
You're advancing quickly with your sorcery skills.

44:58.150 --> 45:01.250
你需要一个安全的地方练习咒语
You need a safe space to practice your spells.

45:19.510 --> 45:21.660
你现在处于镜像次元中
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.780
永恒存在但不会被发觉
Ever present but undetected.

45:25.190 --> 45:26.800
这里的事不会影响真实世界
The real world isn't affected by what happens here.

45:27.850 --> 45:31.390
我们在镜像次元中训练  监视
We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil,

45:32.310 --> 45:34.260
也会用它来控制威胁
and sometimes to contain threats.

45:34.750 --> 45:37.040
千万不要没戴悬戒被困在这里
You don't wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring.

45:37.040 --> 45:39.680
等等  抱歉  你刚说的威胁是什么意思
Hold on. Sorry, what do you mean, threats?

45:49.710 --> 45:51.530
了解无穷的多元宇宙
Learning of an infinite multiverse

45:51.530 --> 45:53.990
就也要了解无尽的危险
includes learning of infinite dangers.

45:54.330 --> 45:56.900
如果我把所有你尚不知道的东西都告诉你
And if I told you everything else that you don't already know,

45:56.900 --> 45:58.660
你只会仓皇逃跑
you'd run from here in terror.

46:04.550 --> 46:07.140
话说  她究竟有多老
So, just how ancient is she?

46:09.330 --> 46:11.990
没人知道至尊法师的年龄
No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme.

46:12.710 --> 46:15.430
只知道她是凯尔特人  从不提起往事
Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past.

46:15.500 --> 46:17.570
你不了解她还追随她
You follow her even though you don't know?

46:17.570 --> 46:20.100
我知道她坚定不移  却又高深莫测
I know that she's steadfast, but unpredictable.

46:20.670 --> 46:22.250
无情  却有仁爱之心
Merciless, yet kind.

46:23.540 --> 46:24.820
是她成就了如今的我
She made me what I am.

46:27.130 --> 46:28.310
相信你的导师
Trust your teacher.

46:29.510 --> 46:30.810
切勿迷失方向
And don't lose your way.

46:30.820 --> 46:32.870
-像卡西利亚斯那样吗  -对
- Like Kaecilius? - That's right.

46:38.410 --> 46:39.490
你认识他
You knew him.

46:40.240 --> 46:43.780
他刚来时  失去了所有挚爱之人
When he first came to us, he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

46:43.780 --> 46:45.570
他悲痛欲绝
He was a grieving, broken man,

46:45.570 --> 46:47.700
在魔法中寻找答案
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

46:47.700 --> 46:51.360
他是个才华横溢的学生  但自傲又顽固
A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong.

46:51.650 --> 46:54.310
他质疑古一法师  排斥我们的教导
He questioned the Ancient One, rejected our teaching.

47:01.450 --> 47:02.840
他离开了卡马塔奇
He left Kamar-Taj.

47:03.330 --> 47:05.690
他的门徒如羊群般跟随
His disciples followed him like sheep

47:06.120 --> 47:08.090
被伪教义迷惑
seduced by false doctrine.

47:08.090 --> 47:11.580
-他偷了一个禁忌法事  对吗  -对
- He stole the forbidden ritual, right? - Yes.

47:11.810 --> 47:12.860
那是干什么的
What did it do?

47:15.240 --> 47:16.520
别再问问题了
No more questions.

47:18.080 --> 47:20.250
-那是什么  -这也是问题
- What's that? - That's a question.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.330
这是个法器
This is a relic.

47:24.250 --> 47:26.150
有些魔法太过强大  无法维持
Some magic is too powerful to sustain,

47:26.150 --> 47:28.070
我们唯有将其注入物件之中
so we imbue objects with it.

47:28.460 --> 47:30.890
让它们去承受我们承受不了的负担
Allowing them to take the strain we can not.

47:31.010 --> 47:31.920
这
This

47:32.570 --> 47:35.920
就是生命法庭权杖
is the Staff of the Living Tribunal.

47:39.420 --> 47:40.790
有很多法器
There are many relics.

47:41.170 --> 47:42.490
瓦图姆魔杖
The Wand of Watoomb.

47:42.490 --> 47:44.780
佛多之靴
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

47:44.780 --> 47:47.240
真是朗朗上口  对吧
Really just roll off the tongue, don't they?

47:47.830 --> 47:49.150
我什么时候能有自己的法器
When do I get my relic?

47:49.150 --> 47:51.210
-等你准备好  -我觉得我准备好了
- When you're ready. - I think I'm ready.

47:51.210 --> 47:53.980
法器觉得你准备好了  你才算准备好了
You're ready when the relic decides you're ready.

47:54.790 --> 47:55.760
现在
For now,

47:57.260 --> 47:58.370
变出一个武器来吧
conjure a weapon.

47:59.550 --> 48:00.500
好吧
All right.

48:07.340 --> 48:08.250
战斗
Fight!

48:08.970 --> 48:11.250
就好像你命系于此
Fight like your life depended on it!

48:17.130 --> 48:19.620
因为有一天  或许真会如此
Because one day, it may.

48:39.810 --> 48:42.980
克里斯汀

48:46.980 --> 48:51.650
我再给你发一次邮件

49:30.310 --> 49:31.240
王
Wong?

49:43.980 --> 49:44.940
好了
Okay.

49:45.590 --> 49:48.940
首先  打开阿戈摩托之眼
First, open the Eye of Agamotto.

50:09.220 --> 50:10.270
好吧
All right.

50:33.930 --> 50:34.920
我的天
Oh my.

50:49.500 --> 50:50.460
能不能...
What if...

51:12.830 --> 51:14.040
多玛姆
Dormammu.

51:15.930 --> 51:17.210
黑暗次元
The Dark Dimension.

51:18.210 --> 51:19.600
永生
Eternal life?

51:24.800 --> 51:25.720
怎么...
What the...

51:26.100 --> 51:27.050
停下
Stop!!!

51:30.960 --> 51:33.140
干涉时空连续性是大忌
Tampering with continuum probabilitie is forbidden!

51:33.140 --> 51:35.820
我只是...在照书上的指示操作
I... I wa... I was just doing exactly what it said in the book!

51:35.820 --> 51:36.900
那进行法事的危险
And what did the book say

51:36.990 --> 51:38.670
书上是怎么说的呢
about the dangers of performing that ritual?

51:38.670 --> 51:40.440
我不知道  我还没看到那儿
I don't know. I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

51:40.440 --> 51:43.520
操纵时间会创建出时间分支
Temporal manipulations can create branches in time.

51:43.850 --> 51:46.140
不稳定的次元开口
Unstable dimensional openings.

51:46.360 --> 51:48.670
空间悖论  时间循环
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!!!

51:48.670 --> 51:52.100
你想被困在一遍遍重复的时间段里吗
You wanna get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever,

51:52.110 --> 51:53.820
或是存在完全被抹去
or never having existed at all?

51:54.670 --> 51:56.780
警告真的应该放在咒语前
Really should put the warnings before the spell.

51:57.010 --> 51:59.120
你的好奇心可能会害死你
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.

51:59.120 --> 52:01.580
你不是在操纵时空连续性
You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum,

52:01.580 --> 52:02.840
而是在破坏它
you were breaking it.

52:03.810 --> 52:06.150
我们不打破自然法则
We do not tamper with natural law.

52:06.400 --> 52:07.140
而是保卫它
We defend it.

52:07.140 --> 52:08.650
你怎么做到的
How did you even do that?

52:09.980 --> 52:11.980
你从哪学到的理解它所需要的
Where did you learn the litany of spells required

52:11.980 --> 52:13.010
冗长的咒语
to even understand it?

52:13.010 --> 52:14.310
我过目不忘
I've got a photographic memory.

52:14.310 --> 52:16.420
所以才能同时拿到医学和哲学博士学位
That's how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

52:16.420 --> 52:17.600
你刚刚做到的
What you just did

52:18.780 --> 52:20.540
需要的不仅是好记性
takes more than a good memory.

52:20.540 --> 52:22.290
你就是为魔法而生的
You were born for the mystic arts.

52:22.290 --> 52:26.050
-但我的手还在抖  -暂时还在抖
- And yet, my hands still shake. - For now, yes.

52:26.050 --> 52:28.450
-不会永远如此吗  -我们不是先知
- Not forever? - We're not prophets.

52:28.450 --> 52:30.430
你们什么时候才肯告诉我  我们是什么
When are you gonna start telling me what we are?

52:35.810 --> 52:37.320
复仇者那样的英雄
While heroes like the Avengers

52:37.320 --> 52:39.740
保护世界免受实体伤害
protect the world from physical dangers,

52:40.130 --> 52:43.670
而我们法师捍卫世界  抵御魔法威胁
we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.

52:44.600 --> 52:48.540
古一法师是最新一位继承了至尊法师头衔的人
The Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme.

52:48.820 --> 52:52.150
他们可追溯至千百年前的魔法鼻祖
Going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts,

52:52.320 --> 52:53.700
全能的阿戈摩托
the mighty Agamotto.

52:54.500 --> 52:58.390
就是那个创造了被你鲁莽借用的魔眼法器的法师
Same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.

52:59.800 --> 53:03.610
阿戈摩托在魔力强的地方造了三座圣殿
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power,

53:03.610 --> 53:05.470
这些地方如今都是大城市
where great cities now stand.

53:05.840 --> 53:08.210
那扇门通往香港圣殿
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum,

53:08.790 --> 53:10.700
那扇通往纽约圣殿
that door to the New York Sanctum.

53:11.420 --> 53:13.380
那扇通往伦敦圣殿
That one, to the London Sanctum.

53:13.530 --> 53:15.410
三座圣殿一起
Together, the Sanctums

53:15.410 --> 53:18.520
生成了一面保护世界的盾牌
generate a protective shield around our world.

53:18.890 --> 53:20.740
圣殿保护世界
The Sanctums protect the world,

53:20.750 --> 53:24.130
我们法师保护圣殿
and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums.

53:24.130 --> 53:25.830
抵御什么
From what?

53:25.930 --> 53:29.230
其他次元里威胁我们宇宙的存在
Other-dimensional beings that threaten our universe.

53:29.620 --> 53:30.770
比如多玛姆
Like Dormammu?

53:32.390 --> 53:33.800
你从哪知道的这个名字
Where did you learn that name?

53:34.220 --> 53:37.500
我刚在《卡里奥斯特罗之书》里读到的  怎么了
I just read it in the book of Cagliostro. Why?

53:42.790 --> 53:45.090
多玛姆存在于黑暗次元中
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

53:46.430 --> 53:47.540
超越时间
Beyond time.

53:48.370 --> 53:52.650
他是宇宙征服者  世界摧毁者
He is the cosmic conquerer, the destroyer of worlds.

53:52.740 --> 53:56.360
拥有无尽力量和无限渴望
A being of infinite power and endless hunger,

53:56.440 --> 53:59.080
他想要侵略所有宇宙
on a quest to invade every universe

53:59.120 --> 54:02.300
把所有世界都纳入他的黑暗次元
and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension.

54:02.750 --> 54:05.220
他最渴望地球
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

54:06.730 --> 54:08.710
卡西利亚斯偷的那几页
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.720
一种联系多玛姆
A ritual to contact Dormammu

54:10.720 --> 54:13.170
并从黑暗次元中汲取能量的法事
and draw power from the Dark Dimension.

54:16.960 --> 54:17.900
好吧
Okay.

54:18.410 --> 54:19.370
好吧
Okay.

54:20.740 --> 54:21.980
我退出  我...
I'm out. I...

54:22.170 --> 54:25.070
我是来治手的
I came here to heal my hands,

54:25.500 --> 54:29.000
不是来打什么魔法战争
not to fight in some mystical war.

54:31.580 --> 54:32.520
伦敦
London.

54:36.630 --> 54:37.730
卡西利亚斯
Kaecilius!

54:38.270 --> 54:39.160
不
No!!!

54:45.500 --> 54:47.350
王  莫多
Wong? Mordo?

55:23.790 --> 55:25.420
<b>布里克街117A</b>

55:38.270 --> 55:39.250
有人吗
Hello?

56:08.740 --> 56:09.810
有人吗
Hello?

56:48.590 --> 56:49.470
丹尼尔
Daniel.

56:49.960 --> 56:52.150
他们任命你为这座圣殿的法师了啊
I see they made you Master of this Sanctum.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.420
你知道那意味着什么吗
You know what that means?

56:55.700 --> 56:57.290
你会为保护它而死
That you'll die protecting it.

57:13.710 --> 57:14.700
住手
Stop!

57:25.970 --> 57:28.510
你到卡马塔奇多久了  你叫...
How long have you been at Kamar-Taj, Mister...?

57:28.680 --> 57:29.620
是博士
Doctor.

57:31.320 --> 57:34.290
-博士先生  -我姓斯特兰奇[是挺怪]
- Mr Doctor? - It's Strange.

57:35.870 --> 57:36.810
也许吧
Maybe.

57:37.590 --> 57:38.650
这又不由我来说
Who am I to judge?

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.340
你不知道怎么用  是吧
You don't know how to use that, do you?

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.650
什么
What?

01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:57.920
别说了
Stop it.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.550
叫你别说了
I said, stop it!

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.060
你阻止不了它的  博士先生
You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.350
听着  我都不知道"它"是什么
Why... look, I don't even know what "This" is.

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:06.510
它既是开始也是结束
It's the end and the beginning.

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.090
多数人变成少数人  变成唯一
The many becoming the few, becoming the One.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.000
你要是不想说明白
Look, if you're not gonna start making sense,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.830
我就再给你戴上它
I'm just gonna have to put this thing back on.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.010
告诉我  博士先生
Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:19.630
听着  我叫斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士
All right, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange.

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:21.110
-你是博士  -对
- You are a doctor? - Yeah.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.420
科学家
A scientist.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.790
你懂自然规律
You understand the laws of nature.

01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:27.710
一切事物都会变老死去
All things age. All things die.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.690
最终  太阳将燃尽
In the end, our sun burns out,

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:32.170
我们的宇宙将变冷毁灭
our universe grows cold and perishes.

01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:33.890
但黑暗次元
But the Dark Dimension...

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:36.600
那个地方超越了时间
it's a place beyond time.

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:38.540
够了  我再给你戴上
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.270
这个世界不非得灭亡  博士
This world doesn't have to die, Doctor.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.100
这个世界有权和其他很多世界一样
This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others,

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.200
成为唯一的一部分
as part of the One.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.290
伟大而美丽的唯一
The great and beautiful One.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.880
我们都能永生
And we can all live forever.

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:50.370
是嘛
Really?

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:56.420
这个新时代乌托邦次元对你有什么好处
What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.220
跟你  跟所有人一样
The same as you. The same as everyone.

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.010
生命  永恒的生命
Life. Eternal life.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.390
人们总是从善恶角度思考
People think in terms of good and evil,

01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:05.720
但其实时间才是所有人真正的敌人
when really, time is the true enemy of us all.

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:07.490
时间会杀死一切
Time kills everything.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.510
那你杀死的人呢
What about the people you killed?

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:11.870
那都只是微小  转瞬即逝的尘埃
Tiny, momentary specks

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:13.410
漂浮在这冷漠的世界里
within an indifferent universe.

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:17.010
是的  你明白了吧
Yes. You see,

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.490
你明白我们在做什么了吧
you see what we're doing?

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.320
这世界不是它应该有的样子
The world is not what it ought to be.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.670
人类渴望永恒
Humanity longs for the eternal,

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:27.650
渴望超越时间的世界  因为时间奴役我们
for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us.

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.580
时间是一种侮辱
Time is an insult.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.660
死亡是一种侮辱
Death is an insult.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:34.130
博士
Doctor...

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.230
我们不求统治世界
We don't seek to rule this world.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.480
我们求的是拯救它  把它交给多玛姆
We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu,

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.090
他才是一切进化的目的
who is the intent of all evolution,

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.860
才是一切生命存在的缘由
the Why of all existence.

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.570
至尊法师保卫生命
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:53.330
是什么让你前往卡马塔奇  博士
What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor?

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.960
是教化
Was it enlightenment?

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:56.510
还是力量
Power?

01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:01.320
你是想去被治愈  我们都是
You came to be healed, as did we all.

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:05.620
卡马塔奇吸纳了各种残破的东西
Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.450
我们都是为治愈的希望而来
We all come with the promise of being healed,

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:10.530
但结果  古一只教我们些雕虫小技
and instead, the Ancient One gives us parlor tricks.

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:13.850
真正的魔法被她据为己有
The real magic she keeps for herself.

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:17.320
你就没想过她是怎么活得这么久的吗
You ever wondered how she managed to live this long?

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:25.720
我在《卡里奥斯特罗之书》中看到了那些法事
I saw the rituals in the book of Cagliostro.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.650
看来你知道
So, you know.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.750
法事给了我
The ritual gives me the power

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:33.080
打倒古一  拆毁圣殿的力量
to overthrow the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down,

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.560
好让黑暗次元进来
to let the Dark Dimension in.

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:39.520
因为古一私藏的  多玛姆会无私给予
Because what the Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely.

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.360
生命  永生
Life, everlasting.

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.190
他不是世界的毁灭者  博士
He is not the destroyer of worlds, Doctor,

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:47.510
而是世界的拯救者
he is the savior of worlds.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.970
不  拜托  看看你的脸
No. I mean, come on. Look at your face.

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:53.250
多玛姆把你变成了凶手
Dormammu made you a murderer.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.730
他的王国又能好到哪去
Just how good can his kingdom be?

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.560
你觉得这很有趣
You think that's funny?

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.540
不是因为那个
No. Not that.

01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:04.660
有趣的是  你的悬戒丢了
What's funny is that you've lost your sling ring.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.730
先生  要帮忙吗
Sir, can I help you?

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.180
帕尔默医生  她在哪
Dr. Palmer, where is she?

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.760
-先生  我们得...  -她在哪
- Sir, we need to get... - Where is she?

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.890
在护士站
The nurses station.

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.540
克里斯汀
Christine!

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.440
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.730
天啊  怎么
Oh my god. What...

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:26.300
你得马上带我找个手术室  就你一个人
You need to get me in an operating theater now. Just you.

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:27.970
快  我没时间了
Now! I haven't any time!

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.210
-怎么了  -被刺了
- What happened? - I was stabbed.

01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:31.990
心脏填塞
Cardiac tamponade.

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.770
你穿的是什么
What are you wearing?

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:42.250
胸腔没问题
Chest cavity is clear.

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:46.460
不  血液  积在围心囊
No, the blood... is in the pericardial sac.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.840
不不不
No. No no no no no no no!

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:50.880

再往上一点
Just a little higher.

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:24.160
小心针头
Please be careful with the needle.

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:26.960
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.580
-这是什么  -我的魂体
- What am I seeing? - My astral body.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.100
你死了吗
Are you dead?

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.210
不  克里斯汀  但我要死了
No, Christine, but I am dying.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:39.910
对了
Right.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.380
好吧
Right.

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:44.990
好  好吧
Yeah. All right. Okay.

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:57.340
我从没见过这样的伤口
I've never seen a wound like this.

01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:58.980
你被什么刺伤了
What were you stabbed with?

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:00.450
我不知道
I don't know.

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:23.590
-我现在得消失了  -什么
- I'm gonna have to vanish now. - No, what?

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:25.100
别让我死  好吗
Keep me alive, will you?

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.200
好
Okay!

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.530
好
Okay.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.040
糟了
Oh shit!

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:28.350
<b>充电至200焦</b>

01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:34.810
醒醒  醒醒
Come on, come on.

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:41.000
斯蒂芬  醒醒
Stephen, come on.

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:44.810
再电我一次
Hit me again!

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:47.060
别这样
Stop doing that!

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.650
提高电压  再电我一次
Up the voltage and hit me again.

01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:50.600
-不  你的心脏跳了  -照做吧
- No, your heart is beating! - Just do it!

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:54.180
天啊
Oh my God.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.300
<b>充电至360焦</b>

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:00.750
<b>不要碰触病人  按电击键</b>

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.730
天啊
Oh god! Oh god!

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.780
-你没事吧  -嗯
- Are you ok? - Yeah.

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:28.890
好了
Okay.

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:38.650
过了这么久  你突然出现
After all this time, you just show up here,

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.190
魂体飞出身体
flying out of your body?

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.700
我知道
Yeah, I know.

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.270
我也想你
I missed you too, by the way.

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:50.790
我给你发了邮件  你从来不回
I wrote you emails, but you never responded.

01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:51.690
为什么要回
Why would I?

01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:55.430
克里斯汀  我太抱歉了
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:57.850
我为一切道歉  你说得对
For all of it. I mean, you were right,

01:10:57.850 --> 01:11:02.090
我是个彻头彻尾的混蛋  我对你太不好了
I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.340
你应得到更好的对待
and you deserved so much more.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.940
别说了  你显然是受惊了
Stop. You... you're clearly in shock.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.960
到底怎么回事
I mean, what the hell is happening?

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.840
你去哪了
Where have you been?

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:15.730
西药没能治好我后
Well, after Western medicine failed me,

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:19.220
我去了东方  最终来到加德满都
I headed East, and I ended up in Kathmandu.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.860
-加德满都  -对
- Kathmandu? - Yeah.

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:23.760
鲍勃·西格歌里唱的那个
What, like the Bob Seger song?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.330
1975年的《美丽失意者》A面
1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah.

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:28.490
然后我去了一个叫卡马塔奇的地方
And then, I went to a place called Kamar-Taj

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:31.260
跟一位叫古一法师的人
and I talked to someone

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.790
聊了聊  然后
called the Ancient One, and...

01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:36.560
-所以你加入了邪教  -不是
- So you joined a cult. - No, I didn't.

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.280
不算是
Not exactly. No. I mean,

01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:40.010
他们确实教我挖掘
they did teach me to tap into powers

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:41.560
我之前闻所未闻的能量
that I never even knew existed.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.000
-听起来就像是邪教  -不是邪教
- Yeah, that sounds like a cult. - It's not a cult.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.650
-邪教徒就会这么说  -不
- Well, that's what a cultist would say. - Oh, no.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.630
等等  斯蒂芬
Wait, Stephen, wait.

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:50.070
你想做什么
What do you think you're doing?

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:51.440
邪教集会我要迟到了
I'm late for a cult meeting.

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:57.450
-简直是疯了  -是啊
- This is insane. - Yeah.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.160
你要去哪
Where are you going?

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:01.870
你能跟我说实话吗
Can you tell me the truth?

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:04.600
一位强大的魔法师
Well, a powerful sorcerer,

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.260
把自己献给了一个远古实体
who gave himself over to an ancient entity

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.630
他能打破物理法则
Can bend the very laws of physics,

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:09.040
还拼命想杀了我
tried very hard to kill me,

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.800
但我把他铐在格林尼治村了
but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village,

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.070
回到那个地方最快的办法是走传送门
and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway

01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:14.490
我在清洁间开了一个
that I opened up in the mop closet.

01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:16.310
好吧  不说算了
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.560
我真的得走了
Really do have to go.

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:17.560
斯特兰奇
Strange!

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:21.390
你没事
You're okay.

01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:24.170
相对而言  是的  我没事
A relative term, but yeah, I'm okay.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.360
悬浮斗篷
The Cloak of Levitation.

01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:28.800
它找上你了
It came to you.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.100
了不起
No minor feat.

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.570
它可花心了
It's a fickle thing.

01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:34.840
他逃走了
He's escaped.

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:36.490
-卡西利亚斯  -对
- Kaecilius? - Yeah.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.990
他能随意折叠空间和物质
He can fold space and matter at will.

01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:43.340
他能在镜像次元外折叠物质
He folds matter outside the mirror dimension?

01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:45.480
-在真实世界中  -对
- In the real world? - Yeah.

01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:47.670
-还有几个  -两个
- How many more? - Two.

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:50.440
我把一个丢在了沙漠里
I stranded one in the desert.

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:53.290
-另一个呢  -他的尸体就在大厅里
- And the other? - His body's in the hall.

01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:55.430
多拉姆法师在门厅里
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.490
他被带回卡马塔奇了
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:59.120
伦敦圣殿沦陷了
The London Sanctum has fallen.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.380
只剩下纽约和香港的
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.390
来抵御黑暗次元
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.100
你保卫了遭受袭击的纽约圣殿
You defended the New York Sanctum from attack.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.340
这里的法师走了  需要一位新的
With its Master gone, it needs another,

01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:10.970
斯特兰奇法师
Master Strange.

01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:14.770
不
No.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.940
我是斯特兰奇博士
It is Dr. Strange.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:20.540
不是斯特兰奇法师[硕士]或斯特兰奇先生
Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange,

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.450
是斯特兰奇博士
Doctor Strange.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:27.080
我成为医生时  曾发誓不伤害他人
When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.900
而我刚刚就杀了一个人  我不会做第二次了
And I have just killed a man! I'm not doing that again.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.920
我当医生是为了救人而非杀人
I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.640
你当医生主要是为了救一条生命
You become a doctor to save one life above all others.

01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:37.790
你自己的
Your own.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.620
还是能看穿我  是吧
Still seeing through me, are you?

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:42.360
我看到的是我一直所见的
I see what I've always seen.

01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:44.700
你过于膨胀的自我
Your overinflated ego.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:48.180
你想回到之前  你能够掌控一切的妄想
You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything,

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.650
甚至掌控死亡
even death,

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:51.400
然而没人能控制死亡
which no one can control.

01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:54.410
伟大的斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士也不行
Not even the great doctor Stephen Strange.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.300
多玛姆也不行
Not even Dormammu?

01:14:58.190 --> 01:14:59.760
他能让人永生
He offers immortality.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.500
正是我们对死亡的恐惧给了多玛姆生命
It's our fear of death that gives Dormammu life.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:05.370
-他以此为食  -正如你以他为食
- He feeds off it. - Like you feed on him?

01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:07.890
你跟我说掌控死亡
You talk to me about controlling death.

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.000
我知道你是怎么做的
Well, I know how you do it.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.070
我看过了《卡里奥斯特罗之书》里缺失的法事
I've seen the missing rituals from the book of Cagliostro.

01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:16.170
千万当心你接下来要说的话  博士
Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.320
因为你可能不喜欢听吗
Because you might not like them?

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:21.080
因为你可能不知道你在说什么
Because you may not know of what you speak.

01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:24.270
-他在说什么  -我在说她的长命
- What is he talking about? - I'm talking about her long life.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.990
她不死的缘由
The source of her immortality.

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:31.090
她从黑暗次元汲取能量来维持生命
She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive.

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:34.560
那不是真的
That's not true.

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.940
我见过那些法事  想明白了
I've seen the rituals, worked them out.

01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:39.110
我知道你是怎么做的
I know how you do it.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.950
等他们重组  狂热信徒就会回来
Once they regroup, the zealots will be back.

01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.230
你们会需要支援
You'll need reinforcements.

01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:55.760
她不是你以为的那样
She is not who you think she is.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.380
你没资格那么说
You don't have the right to say that.

01:15:58.010 --> 01:16:00.470
你不知道她肩上担负的责任
You've no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:02.310
对  我也不想知道
No, and I don't want to know.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.250
-你是个懦夫  -因为我不是个杀手吗
- You're a coward. - Because I'm not a killer?

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:07.120
狂热信徒会把我们统统消灭
These zealots will snuff us all out,

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.720
而你却不能振作起来  先消灭他们
and you can't muster the strength to snuff them first?

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.060
-你以为我刚刚做了什么  -你救了你自己
- What do you think I just did? - You saved your own life!

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:16.590
然后像只受伤的狗一样不停抱怨
And then whined about it like a wounded dog.

01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:17.990
而你就能轻松做到吗
You would have done it so easily?

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:19.310
你无法想象
You've no idea,

01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:21.150
我做过的事
the things I've done...

01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:23.980
答案是没错
And the answer is yes.

01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:28.020
-毫不犹豫  -即使还有别的办法
- Without hesitation. - Even if there's another way?

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.430
-没有别的办法  -是你缺乏想象力
- There is no other way. - You lack imagination.

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:32.880
不  斯蒂芬
No, Stephen.

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:36.530
是你缺少骨气
You lack a spine.

01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:42.600
他们回来了
They're back.

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.700
我们得了结此事
We have to end this.

01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:51.700
快
Now!

01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:00.140
斯特兰奇  下来战斗
Strange! Get down here and fight!

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:01.890
不要
No.

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:07.840
镜像次元
The Mirror Dimension.

01:17:08.210 --> 01:17:10.430
你在这里无法影响真实世界
You can't affect the real world in here.

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:13.680
现在是谁得意呢  混蛋
Who's laughing now, asshole?

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:16.980
是我
I am.

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.830
我拿了他的悬戒  他们跑不了的  对吧
I've got his sling ring. I mean, they can't escape, right?

01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.880
快跑
Run!

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.000
他们与黑暗次元的联系
Their connection to the Dark Dimension

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.270
使他们在镜像次元里更为强大
makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension.

01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:58.620
他们不能影响真实世界  但还是能杀了我们
They can't affect the real world, but they can still kill us.

01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:59.950
这并不明智
This wasn't cleverness.

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:01.770
这是自杀
It was suicide!

01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:20.170
真好笑
That is hilarious.

01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:08.050
这是个错误
This was a mistake.

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:42.000
是真的
It's true.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.970
她真的从黑暗次元汲取能量
She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.

01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:51.150
卡西利亚斯
Kaecilius.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.960
我投奔你时
I came to you,

01:20:55.810 --> 01:20:56.690
心碎
broken,

01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:57.920
迷失
lost,

01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:58.890
需要帮助
in need.

01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:02.760
我信任你做我的导师  你却满口谎言
Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.370
我是想保护你
I tried to protect you.

01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:06.640
-真相会伤害我吗  -你自己会
- From the truth? - From yourself.

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:08.370
如今我有新导师了
I have a new teacher now.

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:10.800
多玛姆在欺骗你
Dormammu deceives you.

01:21:11.670 --> 01:21:14.210
你不知道他的真面目
You have no idea what he truly is.

01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:18.130
他所谓的永生并非天堂  而是无尽的煎熬
His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.

01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:19.090
骗子
Liar.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.660
克里斯汀
Christine!

01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:18.370
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.440
我的天
Oh my god.

01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:25.550
不是心房颤动  她心肌顿抑
It's not fibrillation. She has a stunned myocardium.

01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:26.660
-神经性休克吗  -对
- Neurogenic? - Yes.

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.370
拿棉签
Someone get the swabs.

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.080
尼克
Nic?

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.750
我们得降低她的脑压
We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.970
她心率在下降
She's still dropping.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.450
她快不行了
We're losing her!

01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:48.720
得给她加氧
We need to increase her oxygen!

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.020
-急救车推过来  -她的瞳孔放大了
- I need a crash cart! - Her pupils have dilated!

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.330
无反射能力  也读不到脑部活动了
No reflexes. We're not reading any brain activity.

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.300
你在做什么
What are you doing?

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:09.920
别这样  你快死了
Come on. You're dying!

01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:21.520
你得马上回到身体里  你没时间了
You have to return to your body now. You don't have time.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.620
时间是相对的  你的身体还没倒地呢
Time is relative. Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:31.200
我花了太多岁月窥视未来
I've spent so many years peering through time,

01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:33.690
看这一刻
looking at this exact moment.

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.430
却看不到之后
But I can't see past it.

01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:39.410
我阻止了无数种可怕的未来
I've prevented countless terrible futures.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.990
一次接着一次  永无休止
And after each one, there's always another.

01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:44.160
都将我带到这一刻
And they all lead here,

01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.930
但也止于这一刻
but never further.

01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:47.840
你觉得自己死于这一刻
You think this is where you die.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:51.170
想知道我在你的未来看到什么吗
You wonder what I see in your future?

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:52.590
不想
No.

01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:55.650
想
Yes.

01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:59.650
我从未看到过你的未来  只能看到其可能性
I never saw your future. Only its possibilities.

01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:03.280
你有行大善的能力
You have such a capacity for goodness.

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.110
你总是很出众
You always excelled,

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:07.150
但并非因为你渴望成功
but not because you crave success,

01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:10.030
而是因为你害怕失败
but because of your fear of failure.

01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:12.180
正因此我才是一位优秀的医生
That's what made me a great doctor.

01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:15.120
正因此你无法成就伟业
It's precisely what kept you from greatness.

01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:18.270
傲慢和恐惧仍绊着你
Arrogance and fear still keep you

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.510
让你无法学会最简单也最重要的一课
from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:22.880
是什么
Which is?

01:24:25.050 --> 01:24:27.010
你并不重要
It's not about you.

01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:32.210
你第一次来找我时
When you first came to me,

01:24:32.210 --> 01:24:35.700
问我是如何治愈了乔纳森·潘伯恩
you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.800
我没有
I didn't.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.780
他将次元能量引入体内
He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.

01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:47.450
-他靠魔法行走  -时刻如此
- He uses magic to walk. - Constantly.

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:49.670
他可以选择
He had a choice,

01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:52.540
是回到原来的生活
to return to his own life

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.180
还是为比小我更伟大的事业做贡献
or to serve something greater than himself.

01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:57.350
所以我的手能复原吗
So, I could have my hands back again?

01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.470
我能回到从前的生活吗
My old life?

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.400
可以
You could.

01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:05.340
而世界会因此变得更加危险
And the world would be all the lesser for it.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:09.840
我厌恶从黑暗次元汲取能量
I've hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.370
但你知道
But as you well know,

01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:13.870
人有时必须打破规则
sometimes one must break the rules

01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:15.750
才能够成就伟大的事业
in order to serve the greater good.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.480
莫多不会这么觉得
Mordo won't see it that way.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.520
莫多的灵魂刚强不屈
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable,

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.000
那是他青春的火焰锻造的品性
forged by the fires of his youth.

01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:26.990
他需要你的变通  就像你需要他的力量
He needs your flexibility, just as you need his strength.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.950
你们只有共同努力  才有希望阻止多玛姆
Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu.

01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:33.320
我还没准备好
I'm not ready.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.310
没人会准备好
No one ever is.

01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:40.960
时机由不得我们选
We don't get to choose our time.

01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:47.270
是死亡赋予了生命意义
Death is what gives life meaning.

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.750
知道自己生命有限
To know your days are numbered,

01:25:51.170 --> 01:25:52.900
人生苦短
your time is short.

01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.440
按说都这么久了  我应该准备好了
You'd think after all this time I'd be ready.

01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.500
但你看看我
But look at me,

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:03.000
无限延长片刻时间
stretching one moment out into a thousand,

01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:05.640
就为了看雪景
just so that I can watch the snow.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.770
你还好吗
Are you okay?

01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:57.030
-我不明白是怎么回事  -我知道
- I don't understand what's happening. - I know.

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.990
但我得走了
But I have to go away now.

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:08.450
你曾说失去我的手未必是末路
You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end,

01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:10.090
也可以是开端
that it could be a beginning.

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:11.440
对
Yeah.

01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:15.780
因为还有其他方式可以拯救生命
Because there are other ways to save lives.

01:27:18.970 --> 01:27:20.350
更艰难的方式
A harder way.

01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:24.470
更怪异的方式
A weirder way.

01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:28.610
帕尔默医生  请前往急诊室
Dr. Palmer, to the ER, please. Dr. Palmer, to the ER.

01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:34.600
我不希望你走
I don't want you to go.

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:24.040
停下
Stop.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.610
<b>香港</b>

01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:55.460
好好选择武器
Choose your weapon wisely.

01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:01.230
谁都别想闯进圣殿
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:04.730
谁都别想
No one.

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:21.890
卡西利亚斯
Kaecilius.

01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:24.510
你站错了队  王
You're on the wrong side of history, Wong.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.090
-她死了  -你是对的
- She's dead. - You were right.

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.530
她并不是我以为的那样
She wasn't who I thought she was.

01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:45.870
她很复杂
She was complicated.

01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:52.120
复杂
Complicated?

01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:57.540
黑暗次元不稳定
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:58.980
危险
Dangerous.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.570
如果她被控制了呢
What if it overtook her?

01:30:03.230 --> 01:30:05.400
她教导我们那是禁忌
She taught us it was forbidden,

01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:10.160
她自己却汲取其能量  来盗取数世纪的寿命
while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.130
她做了她以为正确的事
She did what she thought was right.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.030
代价终究会来
The bill comes due.

01:30:15.130 --> 01:30:16.240
你还不明白吗
Don't you see?

01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:21.130
她的犯忌导致狂热信徒投向多玛姆
Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu.

01:30:21.130 --> 01:30:22.520
卡西利亚斯
Kaecilius

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.400
是她的错
was her fault.

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:29.330
而我们现在  就在面对她欺瞒的后果
And here we are, in the consequence of her deception.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.800
浴火的世界
A world on fire.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.850
莫多  伦敦圣殿已经沦陷
Mordo,London Sanctum has fallen.

01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:38.360
纽约圣殿也两次遭到袭击
The New York one has been attacked. Twice.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.070
你清楚他们接下来要去哪
You know where they're going next.

01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:41.740
香港
Hong Kong.

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:44.190
你曾叫我战斗  就好像我命系于此
You told me once to fight like my life depended on it,

01:30:44.190 --> 01:30:45.360
因为有一天  或许真会如此
because one day, it might.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.880
那一天已经到来
Well, today is that day.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.620
我不能一个人打败他们
I cannot defeat them alone.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.020
圣殿已经沦陷
The Sanctum's already fallen.

01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:18.300
黑暗次元
The Dark Dimension.

01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:22.150
多玛姆来了
Dormammu is coming.

01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:25.690
太迟了
It's too late.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.420
没有什么能阻止他了
Nothing can stop him.

01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:30.890
未必
Not necessarily.

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:36.130
不
No.

01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:18.840
咒语起效了
The spell's working.

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.300
我们有第二次机会
We've got a second chance.

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.680
不
No!

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:14.270
王
Wong!

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:25.390
打破自然法则  我知道
Breaking the laws of nature, I know.

01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:28.500
别现在停下
Well, don't stop now.

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:31.800
等圣殿复原
When the Sanctum is restored,

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.080
他们会再次发起攻击  我们得守住
they'll attack it again. We've gotta defend it.

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:34.970
走吧
Come on!

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.350
起来  斯特兰奇  起来战斗
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!

01:35:07.170 --> 01:35:08.620
我们可以做个了结
We can finish this.

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.390
你无法抵抗不可避免之事
You can't fight the inevitable.

01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:16.390
多美啊
Isn't it beautiful?

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.500
超越时间的世界
A world beyond time.

01:35:23.370 --> 01:35:24.680
超越死亡
Beyond death.

01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:30.200
超越时间
Beyond time...

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.630
斯特兰奇
Strange!

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.270
他走了
He's gone.

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.850
就连斯特兰奇也抛下你们  屈服于他的力量
Even Strange has left you and surrendered to his power.

01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:44.770
多玛姆  我来谈条件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:48.190
你是来受死的
You've come to die.

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.460
你的世界现在是我的了
Your world is now my world,

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:55.650
就像所有世界一样
like all worlds.

01:37:25.050 --> 01:37:28.180
多玛姆  我来谈条件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:31.410
你是来受死的
You've come to die.

01:37:31.810 --> 01:37:34.870
你的世界现在是我的了...
Your world is now my...

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.250
这怎么回事
What is this?

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.210
幻觉吗
Illusion?

01:37:39.330 --> 01:37:42.430
-不  是真的  -那就好
- No, this is real. - Good.

01:37:52.530 --> 01:37:55.110
多玛姆  我来谈条件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:58.620
你...怎么回事
You've... what is happening?

01:37:59.590 --> 01:38:02.350
就像你给卡西利亚斯你的次元的力量
Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension,

01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:04.650
我也从我的世界带来了一份力量
I brought a little power from mine.

01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:07.660
这是时间
This is time.

01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:11.380
无尽循环的时间

01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:14.430
你好大胆
You dare!

01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:16.040
该死...
Oh, fu...

01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:19.330
多玛姆  我来谈条件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:22.560
你不能永远这么做
You cannot do this forever.

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:24.340
其实  我能
Actually, I can.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.720
现在就这样了
This is how things are now.

01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:31.870
你和我  困在这一刻里  无穷无尽
You and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly.

01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:35.430
那你就永生永世地死吧
Then you will spend eternity dying.

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.270
是啊  但地球上的人都能得以存活
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:40.980
但你会受尽折磨
But you will suffer.

01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.490
痛苦跟我很熟了
Pain's an old friend.

01:38:46.190 --> 01:38:47.220
多玛姆
Dormammu!

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:50.540
-我来谈条件  -停下
- I've come to bargain. - End this!

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.330
多玛姆
Dormammu!

01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:52.110
多玛姆
Dormammu!

01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:53.210
多玛姆
Dormammu!

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.960
你永远不会赢的

01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:14.630
是啊
No...

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.880
但我可以输
But I can lose.

01:39:17.710 --> 01:39:18.810
一遍
Again,

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.400
又一遍
and again,

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.380
无穷
and again,

01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:24.600
无尽  直到永远
and again, forever.

01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:29.580
-那样你就是我的囚徒  -不
- And that makes you my prisoner. - No.

01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:30.850
停下
Stop!

01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:33.610
停下来
Make this stop!!!

01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:36.210
放了我
Set me free!

01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:37.940
不
No.

01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.210
我来谈条件
I've come to bargain.

01:39:42.090 --> 01:39:44.420
你想要什么
What do you want?

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.440
把你的狂热信徒从地球上带走
Take your zealots from the Earth.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.120
结束你对我的世界的袭击
End your assault on my world.

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.170
永远别回来
Never come back.

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.670
照做  我就结束循环
Do it, and I'll break the loop.

01:40:06.850 --> 01:40:08.130
起来  斯特兰奇
Get up, Strange.

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:09.540
起来战斗
Get up and fight!

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.610
我们可以做个了结
We can finish this.

01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:13.640
多美啊
Isn't it beautiful?

01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:17.670
超越时间的世界
A world beyond time.

01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:21.840
超越死亡
Beyond death.

01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:36.760
-你做了什么  -我谈妥了条件
- What have you done? - I made a bargain.

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.400
这是怎么回事
What is this?

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:42.990
这是
Well, it's,

01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:44.750
你想要的一切
it's everything you've ever wanted.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.060
永生  成为唯一的一部分
Eternal life as part of the One.

01:40:50.830 --> 01:40:52.810
你不会喜欢的
You're not gonna like it.

01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:14.670
你真该把整本书偷走的
You know, you really should have stolen the whole book,

01:41:14.670 --> 01:41:16.200
因为警告
because the warnings...

01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:19.420
警告是写在咒语后面的
the warnings come after the spells.

01:41:29.370 --> 01:41:30.650
真好笑
That's funny.

01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.880
我们成功了
We did it.

01:42:01.890 --> 01:42:03.000
是啊
Yes.

01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:05.190
我们成功了
Yes, we did it.

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:09.870
也是靠违反自然法则
By also violating the natural laws.

01:42:10.670 --> 01:42:12.880
看看你周围  都结束了
Look around you. It's over.

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.410
你还是觉得不会产生后果吗  斯特兰奇
You still think there will be no consequences, Strange?

01:42:17.770 --> 01:42:19.300
不会有代价
No price to pay?

01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:22.870
我们跟她一样  打破了法则
We broke our rules, just like her.

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:27.510
代价终究会来
The bill comes due.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.730
总会来的

01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:31.630
总有清算的一天

I will follow this path no longer.

01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:12.920

01:43:22.210 --> 01:43:23.630
明智之举
Wise choice.

01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:26.320
你今后还会有机会戴阿戈摩托之眼
You'll wear the eye of Agamotto

01:43:26.370 --> 01:43:28.310
等你掌握其法力之后
once you've mastered its powers.

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:29.930
在那之前
Until then,

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.010
最好别戴着无限宝石满街乱跑
best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone.

01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:35.100
什么
A what?

01:43:36.170 --> 01:43:38.010
你或许有魔法天赋
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

01:43:38.010 --> 01:43:40.130
但你还有很多要学
but you still have much to learn.

01:43:41.610 --> 01:43:43.100
古一法师的死
Word of the Ancient One's death

01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:45.170
很快将在多元宇宙里传开

01:43:45.450 --> 01:43:48.330
地球没有至尊法师维护了
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it.

01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:50.600
-我们必须做好准备  -我们会的
- We must be ready. - We'll be ready.

01:46:29.190 --> 01:46:32.440
奇异博士

01:46:32.230 --> 01:46:35.740
奇异博士

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:40.690
地球上现在还有魔法师了
So, Earth has wizards now, huh?

01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:43.520
喝茶吗
Tea?

01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:45.610
我不喝茶
I don't drink tea.

01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:46.960
你喝什么
What do you drink?

01:46:47.850 --> 01:46:49.100
不喝茶
Not tea.

01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:55.600

其他世界  可能对这个世界构成威胁的人

01:46:58.250 --> 01:47:01.940
你的领养弟弟  洛基  就是其中之一
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.580
-的确该加上他  -嗯

为什么带他来纽约
So, why bring him here to New York?

01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:13.530
这说来话长
It's a bit of a long story.

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:15.970
家庭闹剧  之类的
Family drama, that kind of thing, but...

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.500
我们在找我父亲
we're looking for my father.

01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:20.870
好吧  如果你们找到了奥丁

他们拿担架把你抬去了卡马塔奇
They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a strecher.

01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:40.840

我离开了数月  想通了一件事
I've been away for many months now and I've had a revelation.

魔法师的真正意图

01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:57.930
就是扭曲事物应有的形态
is to twist things out of there proper shape.

01:53:58.950 --> 01:54:00.360
盗取能量
Stealing power,

01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:02.790
败坏自然

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.550

因为我终于明白这世界的问题出在哪了
Because I see at long last what's wrong with the world.

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:40.430
有太多魔法师

<b>奇异博士还将回归</b>
