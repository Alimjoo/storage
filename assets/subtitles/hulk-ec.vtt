你要去哪里?

我以前出任务也出过差错
I've run into bad situations on crap missions before.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.600
同袍因为
I've seen good men go down

30:10.700 --> 30:14.000
事先不知情白白牺牲
purely because someone didn't let us know what we were walking into.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.400
但我是军人 必须继续战斗
I've moved on to the next one, because that's what we do, right?

30:16.600 --> 30:17.900
这是我们的天职
I mean, that's the job.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.200
但是这玩意?

30:21.200 --> 30:23.900
这件事太诡异了
This is a whole new level of weird.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.800
我不能就这样撒手不管
And I don't feel inclined to step away from it.

30:26.900 --> 30:30.000
如果你要再去抓他 我要参一脚
So if you're taking another crack at him, I want in.

30:30.100 --> 30:33.900
这次一定要事先准备好
And, with respect, you should be looking for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
因为要是那玩意再出现
because if that thing shows up again,

30:37.200 --> 30:40.800
最勇敢的军人也会被吓得尿裤子
you're gonna have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants.

30:41.800 --> 30:42.600

An oversimplification, but yes.

32:38.700 --> 32:42.600
我命令他们再度进行大胆实验
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing serious work again, bold work.

32:42.700 --> 32:45.400
研发部只想制造更好的武器
Across the hall, they were trying to arm you better.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.700
我们则想打造更强的士兵
We were tryin' to make you better.

32:51.100 --> 32:56.400
班纳的实验只达到初步阶段 根本就还不能应用
Banner's work was very early phase. It wasn't even weapons application.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.100
他以为他在研究抗辐射方法
He thought he was working on radiation resistance.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.400
我从来没告诉他真相
I would never have told him what the project really was.

33:02.500 --> 33:07.100
但他太有把握了 竟然私自进行人体实验
But he was so sure of what he was onto, that he tested it on himself.

33:07.200 --> 33:10.000
结果出了大错
And something went very wrong.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.300
或者是完全做对了
Or it went very right.

33:15.200 --> 33:19.200
他的身体是属于美国军方的
As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is the property of the US Army.

33:19.300 --> 33:22.300
你说他不是研发武器 对吧?
You said he wasn't working on weapons, right?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.500
- 是的 - 但你是 是你 对吧?
- No. - But you were. You were, weren't you?

33:24.600 --> 33:26.600
但是你们在进行别的实验
You were trying other things.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.600
我们研发出一种
One serum we developed

33:30.800 --> 33:32.100
很有潜力的血清
was very promising.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.800
- 他为什么要逃亡? - 他是个科学家
- So why did he run? - He's a scientist.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.100
不是军人
He is not one of us.

33:41.400 --> 33:45.400
- 你几岁?45岁? - 39岁
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45? - 39.

33:46.300 --> 33:49.900
- 打仗老得快 对吧? - 没错
- It takes a toll, doesn't it? - Yes, it does.

33:49.900 --> 33:51.200
那就别再出任务
So get out of the trenches.

33:51.300 --> 33:53.700
以你的记录 你可以当上校
You should be a Colonel by now, with your record.

33:53.900 --> 33:57.900
不 我是战士 永远都是
No, I'm a fighter. I'll be one for as long as I can.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.400
如果十年前的我有我现在的经验
You know, if I could take what I know now, put it in the body I had ten years ago,

34:01.500 --> 34:04.200
我绝对不会跟我自己对决
that would be someone I wouldn't want to fight.

34:06.100 --> 34:09.100
我可以让你变得更强
I could probably arrange something like that.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.300

- 她有男友了? - 对 他是精神科医师
- She's with somebody? - Yeah, he's a head shrink.

They say he's one of the best. But a really nice guy.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.400
很好 那很好
Good. That's good.

37:15.500 --> 37:20.300
- 布鲁斯 我能帮你什么忙? - 我需要地方住几晚

37:20.400 --> 37:24.300
- 你可以用楼上的空房间 - 那真是太好了
- You can have the spare room upstairs. - That'd be so great.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.300

我说:"你在哪里?
And he... I go, "So, yeah, I mean, where were you?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
"我不知道你在哪里"
"I can't... I don't know where you were, Cecil."

40:54.000 --> 40:56.500

我有两年没跟他说话

43:55.500 --> 43:56.900
你一定要确定
You have to be sure.

43:57.100 --> 44:02.100
为什么不能一起直接去找他?
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't just go in there together and talk to him.

44:02.100 --> 44:07.100
他跟我说过他想做什么 他要取出我体内的细胞
He told me what he wanted to do. He wants it out of me.

44:07.200 --> 44:10.400
进行分析后再复制它
He wants to dissect it so that he can replicate it.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.700
让它成为武器

First sign of any side effect,

46:45.900 --> 46:49.500
我就喊停 等你恢复以后才能复职
we stop and you're off team until you straighten out.

46:50.300 --> 46:52.100
- 同意吗? - 同意
- Agreed? - Agreed.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.700
你要打两次针
You'll get two separate infusions.

46:58.800 --> 47:02.800

这样比较好看
- It's better like that. - Yeah?

48:18.600 --> 48:20.100
帽子太小了
It feels too tight, huh?

48:20.200 --> 48:22.000
是有点小
- Yeah, a little. - Okay.

48:29.500 --> 48:32.500

她跟他在一起很危险
She'll be in incredible danger as long as she's with him.

58:30.700 --> 58:32.000

看得出谁说谎
that I can always tell when somebody's lying.

58:45.500 --> 58:46.500

我不知道他去哪里

58:51.100 --> 58:55.100
- 我只知道她一定会帮他 - 那她就算是协助逃犯
- I know she'll help him, if she can. - Then she's aiding a fugitive.

58:56.500 --> 58:59.000
我也帮不了他们
And I can't help either one of them.

59:04.100 --> 59:07.200
我一直在想她为什么从不提起你
I used to wonder why she never talked about you.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.000
现在我知道原因了
Now I know!

59:13.900 --> 59:16.200

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.200
布鲁斯
Bruce.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.600
没关系 没有事
It's okay. It's okay.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.500
过来 跟我来
Come here. Come this way.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.300
小心头
Watch your head.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.500
我们没事
We're okay.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.900
没事
It's okay.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.400
只是下雨而已
It's just the rain.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.800
他能再走路吗?
Will he ever walk again?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.500
他全身的骨头支离破碎
Most of the bones in his body look like crushed gravel right now.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:58.400
不过我很佩服他 他的心脏像个机器
I will say this for him. He's got a heart like a machine.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.700
就跟赛马一样强
Never seen anything like it, outside of a racehorse.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.400
来
Here.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.000
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.400
你还好吧?
Are you okay?

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.200
我好多了
Yeah.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.600
事实上 我感觉好多了
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.300
- 那就好 - 我得把资料拿出来
- Good. - I just had to get my data back.

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.000
你把它吃掉?
You ate it?

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:08.100
情况紧急 我总得想办法
Well, you know, the circumstances called for a little improvisation.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.300
款式不多 不过你有一些选择
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection, but I got you some options.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.000
这玩意比较重要
First thing's first.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.700
你在开玩笑吧?
Oh, you're kidding me.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.100
怎么了?
What?

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:34.600
这是最宽松的一件
- No. - They were the stretchiest pair they had.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.900
我宁愿冒险
I'll take my chances.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.600
有关于军队和不明敌人
Rumours continue to swirl about a violent clash

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.600
在卡尔弗大学校园发生激烈战斗的谣言
between forces of the US military and an unknown adversary

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.600
持续延烧
on the campus of Culver University earlier today.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.900
两名大二学生目击整个事件
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.500
那玩意超大的
It was so big.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.400
就像一个绿色巨人
- It was like this huge, like, hulk! - Yeah.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.500
其中一名学生是校报记者
McGhee, who happens to be a reporter for the campus paper,

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.300
他用手机拍下这些画面
captured this on his cell phone.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.100
国家森林下起一阵雷暴雨
Further search for the mysterious "hulk"

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.700
神秘绿巨人的搜寻行动因此拖延
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.100
"汽车旅馆"

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.200
后面不要剪太短
Not too short back there.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.700
我以前帮你剪过头发
I have done this before, you know.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.200
我不知道你自己是怎么剪的
I don't know how you've done this on your own for all this time.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.200
通常都是用电剪
With clippers, usually.

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.700
等一下
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait. - What? What?

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:37.200
我们不能这样
We can't do this.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.400
- 没关系 我想要 - 不
- It's okay. I want to. - No.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.500
不
No.

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.900
我不行
I can't.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.500
我不能太兴奋
I can't get too excited.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.300
一点点都不行吗?
Not even a little excited?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.400
没关系
It's okay.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.900
长官 是布朗斯基
Sir, it's Blonsky.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.300
他有没有家人?
Has anyone found out if he has next of kin or family?

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:12.700
你自己问他
Ask him yourself.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.600
长官?
Sir?

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:41.800
- 很高兴看到你复原 大兵 - 谢谢你 长官
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier. - Thank you, sir.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.000
你觉得怎样?
How do you feel?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.400
超不爽的 我要打第三回合
Pissed off and ready for round three.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.800
这些都不能用 会被追踪
Basically, we can't use any of this, because they can track all of it.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.700
我的唇蜜都会被追踪?
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.800
- 不会 你可以拿去 - 谢了
- No. You can take your lip gloss. - Thank you.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:14.800
- 我也需要眼镜 - 你也可以
- Well, I need my glasses. - Well, you can take

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.100
把眼镜和手表拿去
- your glasses and your watch, okay? - Okay.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.800
大部份都能用 不能用信用卡
We can use most of it. We just can't use the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.100
手机也别开机
- Don't even turn that on. - Okay.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.400
我们只能用现金
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.400
光靠四十块钱该怎么逃亡?
How will we get where we need to go on $40 and no credit cards?

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.300
我们可以典当这条项链
Well, we could sell this.

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.000
不 这是你妈唯一留给你的
No. No, that's the only thing you have left from her. No.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.900
那就一定要赎回来
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.500
调查局在监视手机信用卡
Federal is already monitoring phones,plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,

01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.100
和罗博士的纲路帐号
and local PD have been placed on alert.

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.900
当地警方设下临检站 只要他们出现就会通知我们
They'll pop up somewhere and when they do, it comes straight to us.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.900
他们不会就这样出现
They're not gonna just pop up.

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.100
他这五年来一直在各国游走
He made it five years and got across borders without making any mistakes.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.000
绝对不会使用信用卡
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.100
他想逃早就走远了
If he was trying to escape, he'd be long gone.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.400
这次他不准备逃跑了
He's not trying to escape this time.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.000
如果他想找人帮忙我们就能逮到他
He's looking for help and that's how we're gonna get him.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.500
他有和别人联络
We know what they're after and we know he's been talking to somebody.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.400
你们都看过资料
You all have copies of the correspondence.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:12.900

If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.300
他一现身 我们马上知道
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.800
他一出错 我们就会出动
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800

出售

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.900
笑一个
Smile.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.000
那是什么感觉?
What is it like?

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.600
变身的感觉是什么?
When it happens, what do you experience?

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.000
记得我们在哈佛自愿参与的
Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard?

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.100
引导幻觉实验吗?
Those induced hallucinations?

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:37.300
就像那样 再放大一千倍
It's a lot like that, just a thousand times amplified.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.100
就像把一公升迷幻药倒进我脑袋
It's like someone's poured a litre of acid into my brain.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:48.000
- 你记得什么吗? - 只有零星的画面

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.700
太多噪音 我什么也分不清楚
There's too much noise. I can never derive anything out of it.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.300
- 那么你还是在它里面 - 并没有
- But then it's still you inside it. - No. No, it's not.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.800
我不晓得 但它在山洞 我觉得它就像知道我一样
I don't know. In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.100
也许你的大脑超载
Maybe your mind is in there,

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.800
失去控制
it's just overcharged and can't process what's happening.

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:10.200
我不想控制它 我想消灭它
I don't want to control it. I want to get rid of it.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.900
准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.700
这样才旗鼓相当
Let's even the playing field a little.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.400
开始了
Gentlemen.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.000
布鲁斯 醒醒 情况不妙
Bruce, wake up. There's something going on.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.500
前有路障

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.500
准备停车

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.200
我们得下车 慢慢往后面走
We got to go. Walk toward the back. Just don't move too fast.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.300
好了 来吧
All right. Come.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.400
到上城很远 坐地铁应该最快
It is a long way uptown. I think the subway's probably quickest.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.200
我和几百个人挤在车厢
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.800
肯定会被逼到抓狂
with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world?

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.600
没错 咱们坐计程车
Right. Let's get a cab.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.900
拜托!快点!你开车像个娘儿们!
Come on, now! Let's go! You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.300
看到没?一个大美女
- Very nice. You see her? - Oh, my.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.500
你有没有长眼睛呀?
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.700
呼吸 呼吸
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.700
你疯了吗?
Are you out of your mind?

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.000
怎么?
- What is wrong with you? - What's the matter, baby?

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.800
你不喜欢飙车?
You don't like a good ride?

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:04.900
大混球
Asshole!

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.600
我可以教你怎么控制怒气
You know, I know a few techniques could help you

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:14.700
闭嘴 走吧
- manage that anger very effectively. - You zip it. We're walking.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.800
对不起 史登博士?
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.500
我是伊莉莎白罗斯
- Yes. - I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.400
罗斯博士!
Oh! Dr Ross!

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.400
- 有人想要见你 - 好
- I have someone who'd like to meet you. - Okay.

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.300
蓝先生?
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.600
绿先生?
Mr Green?

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.500
我一直在猜你是不是真有其人
I got to tell you, I've been wondering if you were even real.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.300
如果是 你长什么样子
And if you were, what would it look like?

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.100
一个蕴藏着这么强大力量的人
A person with that much power lurking in him.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.800
竟然像你这么不起眼
Nothing could have surprised me more

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:58.700
让我大吃一惊
than this unassuming man shaking my hand.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:01.500
这并不简单...
But, look. We're not strolling into the park for a picnic, here.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.200
就算一切都顺利
Even if everything goes perfectly,

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:07.200
引导你变身后注射正确剂量
if we induce an episode, if we get the dosage exactly right,

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.100
你会永远被治愈...
is that going to be a lasting cure

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.500
...或者只是暂时被压制而已?
or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare- up?

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.300
我也不知道
I don't know.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.700
要是注射的剂量稍微多一点
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:28.600
就会出现高成份的毒性
we're dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:33.200
- 可能会害死他 - 当然了 我敢肯定
- You mean it could kill him. - Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.000
也可能完全相反
You should know that there's a flip side to this, too.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:40.600
要是剂量太少 无法压制我
If we miss on the low side, if we induce me and it fails,

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.200
你就会陷入危险
this will be very dangerous for you.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
我一向都是个好奇宝宝
Look. I've always been more curious than cautious,

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.200
从来没出过事 到底要不要做呀?
and that's served me pretty well. So, are we going to do this?

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.100
你有什么感觉?
How you feeling, man?

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.400
像个怪物
Like a monster.

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.000
好了 躺上去
Okay. On the table.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:21.200
万一你有强烈反应 这能保护你自己
These will protect you from yourself if you have a strong reaction.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.400
等你觉得太强烈再告诉我
You can tell me later if you thought it was strong.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.000
拜托 那些蠢研究生
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.900
你 你 你
You, you, you.

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.900
这会是很新奇的感觉
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.100
我们开始了
We have begun.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.900
血液析离器会混和解药和你的血液
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood.

01:16:56.100 --> 01:17:00.500
但你要完全变身解药才会起作用
Except the antidote will only take hold once we've achieved a full reaction.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.700
放轻松
Just relax.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.800
好了 作业完成
Okay. We are comprehensive.

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:10.500
拿去
Here you go.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.500
好了 准备好了吗?
All right. We set to pop?

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.200
你最好别碰他
I'd take your hands off him.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
我的老天!
Oh, my God!

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.200
等等 还没结束
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.600
- 现在 现在! - 等一下
- Now. Okay, now! - Wait.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.200
快点!快点!
Now, do it! Do it!

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.300
布鲁斯 看着我
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.800
快注射解药 史登 快呀!
Stay with me. The antidote, now! Sterns, do it now!

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.300
布鲁斯 看着我的眼睛
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes. Please, look in my eyes.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.900
这一定是开玩笑
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.700
布鲁斯
Bruce.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:07.200
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.600
布鲁斯?你听得见吗?
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:26.800
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:39.000
没事了 你没事了
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:43.900
你撑过去了
You did it.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.700
他没事 太棒了
He's fine. This is fantastic.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.100
结束了
It's over.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:05.800
那是我这辈子见过最惊人的事
That was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my entire life!

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.500
别这么兴奋
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.000
我们得讨论刚才发生的事
We need to go back and talk about what just happened in there.

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:13.900
没问题 伽玛脉冲来自大脑的杏仁核
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse came from the amygdala.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.700
- 我想是罗斯博士的核酸链 - 你还好吗?
- I think Dr Ross's primer...- Are you okay?

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.000
核酸链让你的细胞暂时吸收能量 过一阵子能量就减退
...lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily, and then it abates.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.900
所以你多年前才没死于辐射病
That's why you didn't die of radiation sickness years ago!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.700
我们也许中和了这些细胞
Now, maybe we've neutralised those cells permanently,

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.700
或者只是压制这次变身
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.100
我猜是后者吧 但是我不确定
I'm inclined to think the latter, but it's hard to know

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.000
我的实验样本从来没有存活
because none of our test subjects ever survived.

01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.600
- 当然 他们没有得到核酸链 - 等等
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer! - Wait, wait.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.100
- 慢着, 你说什么? - 它们没有吸收
- Wait, what did you just say?- They weren't getting

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:37.000
- 核酸链 - 不 不 实验样本?
- the myostatin primer...- No, no, no. Test subjects?

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.600
什么实验样本?
What test subjects?

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.400
跟我来
Come with me.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:02.400
- 布署得如何? - 狙击手负责A区
- What's the activity level? - Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:04.700
我们先用白老鼠做实验
We started on rats and mice,

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.300
但是都死掉 于是得用大型动物
but it just completely fried them, so we had to go bigger.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.700
我不确定是伽玛或是你的血比较毒
And we still don't know which is more toxic, the gamma or your blood.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.500
- 什么意思? - 这全都是你的血
- What do you mean, my blood? - Bruce, this is all you.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:19.400
你寄给我的并不多 于是我浓缩以后又制造更多
You didn't send me much to work with, so I had to concentrate it and make more.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.700
只要继续研究就有无限的可能
With a little more trial and error, there's no end to what we can do!

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.500
无穷的潜力
This is potentially Olympian!

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.100
这种伽玛科技有数不尽的用途
This gamma technology has limitless applications.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:32.200
我们能发现数百种解药
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.400
让人类对各种疾病完全免疫
We will make humans impervious to disease!

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:51.300
不 我们得销毁它
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.600
- 什么?- 所有
- Wait, what? - All of it.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.200
今晚就得把这一切烧毁
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.500
- 这里的所有? - 什么
- Is this the whole supply? - What...

01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.100
我们可以得到诺贝尔奖耶!
We could get the Nobel for this!

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.400
你不知道这东西的力量
You don't understand the power of this thing.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.100
太危险了 无法控制
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.300
看到目标就开枪
At your discretion, shooter.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.800
我们三个!这是普罗米修斯的圣火!
three of us!This is Promethean fire!

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:08.900
仅仅
It's just...

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:10.300
瞄不准
No shot.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.400
布朗斯基进去了
Blonsky's going in.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.500
不准进去 我女儿在里头
Blonsky, stand down. My daughter's in there!

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.200
我们有解药
We have the antidote now.

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:27.100
他们只想把它当成武器
They don't want the antidote! They want to make it a weapon!

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
如果它被政府抢走就完了
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.200
你不知道它的力量有多强大
You don't know how powerful this thing is.

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.300
我也讨厌政府
I hate the government just as much as anyone,

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.200
不过你也未免太紧张了
but you're being a little paranoid, don't you think?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.500
布鲁斯!布鲁斯!
Bruce! Bruce!

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.400
快走
Get out.

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.500
它在哪里?
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.300
让它现身
Show him to me.

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.100
布朗斯基!
Blonsky!

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.700
小姐
Miss!

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.600
披着吧
Take this.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.800
你敢消灭浩克就得一辈子坐牢
If you took it from me, I'm gonna put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.700
贝蒂
Betty.

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:41.600
我永远不会原谅你这么对他
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.100
他是个逃犯
He's a fugitive.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.100
是你逼他成为逃犯
You made him a fugitive

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.700
为了掩饰你的失败和保护你自己
to cover your failures and to protect your career.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.400
我不屑再当你的女儿
Don't ever speak to me as your daughter again.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:58.100
如果你不是我女儿也会被捕
It's only because you're my daughter that you're not in handcuffs, too.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.200
你能打造出更多浩克?
Are you telling me you can make more like him?

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:09.000
还不行 我有一些资料
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces, but it's not like I can put together

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.500
但是还不能复制出同样的巨人
the same Humpty Dumpty, if that's what you're asking.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:16.400
浩克纯粹是个意外 我的目标是要做得更好
He was a freak accident! The goal is to do it better!

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.400
班纳是唯一的...
So Banner's the only...

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:26.700
- 她真的很烦人 - 你为什么老是在打人?
- She's an annoying bitch. - Why are you always hitting people?

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:34.200
我到底是做了什么惹毛了你?
Now what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression?

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.000
不是你做的事 是你要做的事
It's not what you've done. It's what you're gonna do.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.400
我要你从班纳身上提炼的东西
I want what you got out of Banner. I want that.

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.900
看来你已经注射了一些东西
You look like you've got a little something in you already, don't you?

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:52.900
我要更多 你也看到他变成浩克
I want more. You've seen what he becomes, right?

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.800
没错
I have.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.300
它太美了
And it's beautiful.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.400
就像神一样
Godlike.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.300
我也要变成那样
Well, I want that.

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.600
你要把我变成那样
I need that. Make me that.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:09.400
我不知道你体内有什么
I don't know what you've got inside you already.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.100
混在一起可能变成
The mix could be

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.300
一个大祸害
an abomination.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.800
我没说我不愿意
I didn't say I was unwilling.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.100
我只是需要你的同意
I just need informed consent.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.400
你也同意了
And you've given it.

01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:00.000
"绿先生-效力14.56%"

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.800
这就是我想跟你解释的事
This is what I was trying to explain.

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:18.800
我不知道你注射了什么东西
I don't know what you've been ladling into yourself.

01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:20.900
但是很明显起了效用
But clearly it worked.

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.600
我假设你完全听不懂我的话
Let's assume you don't understand a word I'm saying,

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.600
不过还是请你躺回去
but if you'll just get back on the table,

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.200
好让我把你治好
I can fix this.

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.800
- 开枪! - 嘿
Shoot it! - Hey!

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.600
不
No!

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.300
D4呼叫队长
Delta 4 to Leader.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.100
他们杀死我们两名弟兄
They took out two of our guys, two of our guys!

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.900
布朗斯基和中校还在里头
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.100
快点!快走!
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.600
它在那里!
It's over there!

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.600
离开他们
Drop them!

01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.900
- 那是什么东西? - 向它开枪!
What is that thing? - Shoot it!

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.200
你开车!快!快走!
Okay. All right! You... You, drive! Let's go! Move, move!

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.600
队长
Delta 4 to Leader! - Go, go, go, go, go!

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.600
有个大怪物从这里逃走
Something big just went off down here!

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.300
将军 你最好听听看
General, you should hear this!

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.300
浩克在街上!重复 浩克在街上!
The Hulk is in the street! I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:53.900
不可能 先冷静下来
That's impossible. You get a hold of yourself, young man.

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.900
你在哪里?
You get it together. What is your position?

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:59.300
121街和北向百老汇路口
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:01.000
快掉头
Turn us around.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.100
我们为什么要回去?
We're going back. Why are we going back?

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.800
给我影像
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:14.500
是 长官
Yes, sir!

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.500
那是什么东西?
What the hell was that?

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.400
快 快
Go, go, go!

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.200
不!
No!

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.800
你的实验品吗?
One of yours?

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:06.200
天啊 你做了什么?
Oh, my God. What have you done?

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.400
开火!开火!
Fire at him, fire at him!

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.800
你想它怕子弹吗?
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.400
走吧!
Come on!

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.100
水喔
Sweet.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.600
赶快撤退!
Get out of there, soldier!

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:24.100
给我更强的对手
Give me a real fight!

01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:33.400
长官?
Sir?

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.200
长官?
Sir?

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.700
下令把所有军力调到哈林区
Tell them to bring everything they've got and head for Harlem.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:48.600
让我去 你一定要让我去
It has to be me. You have to take me back there.

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:50.500
你在说什么?
What are you saying?

01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:51.900
你以为你能控制它?
You think you can control it?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.100
不是控制 而是利用它
No, no, not control it, but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.700
要是不行呢?
And what if you can't?

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.000
这东西是我们创造出来的
We made this thing.

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:01.800
我们所有人
All of us.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.000
求求你
Please.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.500
- 降落在它附近 - 不 留在高空
- Land us near it. - No, no. No, keep us high.

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.400
打开后舱门
Open the back door.

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:25.000
布鲁斯 站住 你在做什么?
Bruce! Bruce, stop! Stop! What are you doing?

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:28.800
你要想清楚 你不知道自己会不会变身
Think about this! You don't even know if you'll change!

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:34.000
别这么做 太疯狂了
You don't have to do this! Please, this is insane!

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.900
贝蒂 我得试一试
Betty, I've got to try.

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.400
对不起
I'm sorry.

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:10.500
- 把她拉进来 - 来吧 小姐
- Get her in here! - Come on, miss.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
贝蒂 它在那里
There. Betty!

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:50.700
浩克!
Hulk!

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.100
太好了!
Yeah!

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:42.600
来吧!
Come on!

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:16.800
你只有这点料吗?
Is that all you've got?

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.300
快用机关枪!帮助他!
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:34.700
帮哪一个?
Which one?

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.100
绿色的那一个
Help the green one, damn it! Which one do you think?
