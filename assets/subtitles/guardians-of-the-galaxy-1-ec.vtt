17:35.610 --> 17:37.430
我招惹不起
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

17:37.430 --> 17:38.870
不是吧  那我就可以招惹吗
What? What about my bad side?

17:38.870 --> 17:40.580
再会无期  奎尔先生
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.360

Hey, we had a deal, Bro!

17:50.480 --> 17:51.560
怎么了
What happened?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.580
这家伙翻脸不认账
This guy just backed out of a deal on me.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.730
我最讨厌的就是不守信用的男人
If there's one thing I hate, it's a man without integrity.

17:58.730 --> 18:00.810
彼得·奎尔  大家都叫我星爵
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.310
看得出你是个正人君子
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

18:04.310 --> 18:06.740
我也没那么好啦
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.430
大家倒都这么说我
People say it about me, all the time,

18:09.430 --> 18:12.220
不过我一般不会这么夸自己
but it's not something I would ever say about myself.

18:30.420 --> 18:31.960
这就不能怪我了
This wasn't the plan.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.100
把他装进袋子  把他装进袋子
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

18:36.580 --> 18:38.960
不  不是她  是他
No! Not her, him!

18:38.960 --> 18:40.690

Biting? That's not fair!

18:46.960 --> 18:48.040
放松
Take it easy!

19:17.850 --> 19:19.780
蠢货  你该长点记性
Fool. You should have learned.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.150

I don't learn. One of my issues.

19:29.890 --> 19:30.980

19:35.010 --> 19:38.000

Quit smiling, you idiot. You're supposed to be a professional.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.910
饶了我吧
You gotta be kidding me.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.570
我满足起来很容易
I live for the simple things.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.050

Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

-星爵  -抱歉了爵爷
- Star-Lord. - Sorry. "Lord."

20:43.430 --> 20:45.440
我之前因为小偷小摸抓过他
I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.880
他还有个代号呢
He's got a code name.

20:47.350 --> 20:48.150
请让开
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

20:48.150 --> 20:50.400
拜托  一听就是个大盗的名字啊
Come on, man. It's a... It's an outlaw name.

20:50.410 --> 20:51.810
没事的  小哥
Just relax, pal.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.590
有代号挺酷的  也没有很奇怪了
It's cool to have a code name. It's not that weird.

如果你的目标是杀了罗南
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose,

29:43.330 --> 29:45.430
杀了她也没法帮你实现目标
I don't think this is the best way to go about it.

29:45.430 --> 29:48.550
这贱女人不是也刺杀过你吗
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?

29:48.550 --> 29:49.800
反正她也不是第一个
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first woman

29:49.810 --> 29:51.220
想杀我的女人了
to try and do that to me.

29:51.340 --> 29:54.850
你看  这疤是一个巨火辣的拉贾克妞弄的
Look, this is from a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

29:54.850 --> 29:55.930
拿叉子戳出来的
Stabbed me with a fork.

29:55.930 --> 29:57.490
她不乐意我大清早就离她而去
Didn't like me skipping out on her at sunrise.

29:57.490 --> 30:00.980
这条疤是因为有个克里妞想把我的胸腔破开
I got, right here, a Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax.

30:00.990 --> 30:01.740
我在和新星档案处
She caught me with this

30:01.740 --> 30:02.960
一个瘦瘦的阿斯卡瓦里安妞
skinny little A'askavariian

30:02.960 --> 30:04.950
鬼混时被她抓包了
who worked in Nova Records.

30:04.950 --> 30:05.930
我只是想套些消息而已
I was trying to get information.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.640
你见过阿斯卡瓦里安人吧
You ever see an A'askavariian?

30:07.760 --> 30:09.570
她们长着触角  牙齿跟针一样
They have tentacles, and needles for teeth.

30:09.570 --> 30:12.020
你觉得我真会看上...
If you think I'm seriously interested in that, then...

30:12.900 --> 30:15.830
好吧你不在乎  但我想说的是
You don't care. But here's the point.

30:17.040 --> 30:20.420
她背叛了罗南  他会来追杀她
She betrayed Ronan. He's coming back for her.

30:20.570 --> 30:22.080
等他自己找过来
And when he does,

30:22.210 --> 30:24.080
到时你就可以
that's when you...

30:25.220 --> 30:27.970
我为什么要把手指放在他的喉咙上
Why would I put my finger on his throat?

30:28.410 --> 30:29.300
啥
What?

30:31.550 --> 30:32.740
这只是个手势
No, it's a symbol.

30:32.740 --> 30:36.830
这个手势表示你割了他的喉咙
This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.460
我才不想割他的喉咙
I would not slice his throat.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.980
我会一刀砍了他的脑袋
I would cut his head clean off.

30:41.980 --> 30:44.500
这是通用手势啊  意思是杀人
It's a general expression for you killing somebody.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.110
你听说过  见过这手势  对吧
You've heard of this. You've seen this, right?

30:46.110 --> 30:47.660
-你知道这什么意思吧  -知道  知道
- You know what that is. - Yeah. Yeah.

30:47.660 --> 30:49.990
-人人都知道  -不知道  不知道
- Everyone knows. - No, no.

30:51.590 --> 30:54.710
我就是想说  你最好留她一命
What I'm saying is, you want to keep her alive.

30:55.100 --> 30:56.770
别帮你敌人的忙
Don't do his work for him.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.960
我喜欢你的刀  我收下了
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.160
-那是人家最喜欢的刀  -听着
- That was my favorite knife. - Listen!

31:16.320 --> 31:19.400
我才懒得管你是死是活
I could care less whether you live or whether you die.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.280
-那你拦下那大个子干什么  -简单
- Then why stop the big guy? - Simple.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.080
你知道能把宇宙灵球卖给谁
You know where to sell my Orb.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.480
我们和那东西都困在这里  你怎么卖
How are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here?

31:27.720 --> 31:29.190
我这位火箭老兄
My friend Rocket, here,

31:29.360 --> 31:30.640
成功越狱22次
has escaped 22 prisons.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.530
我们肯定出得去
We're getting out.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.480
然后我们直奔勇度那里去取你的赏金
And then we're headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

31:35.640 --> 31:39.280
你那买家打算花多少钱买我的宇宙灵球
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?

31:40.640 --> 31:41.800
四十亿
Four billion units.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.520
-多少  -我操
- What? - Holy shit.

31:43.960 --> 31:47.480
宇宙灵球是我逃离灭霸和罗南的机会
That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.630
如果你能越狱
If you free us,

31:51.400 --> 31:52.890
我就直接带你去见买家
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

31:52.920 --> 31:54.640
卖的钱我们三个平分
and I'll split the profit between the three of us.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.480
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

31:56.960 --> 31:57.960
四人平分
Four of us.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.170
出事儿了睡大觉  一听见钱就来精神
Asleep for the danger, awake for the money,

32:00.200 --> 32:01.670
死性不改
as per frickin' usual.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.640
你被背叛了  罗南
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.120
我们只知道她被捉住了
We know only that she has been captured.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.970
卡魔拉也许还有机会取回宇宙灵球
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.560
错  我们在克林的线人
No! Our sources within the Kyln

32:13.560 --> 32:15.880
说卡魔拉对宇宙灵球自有打算
say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.090
你跟灭霸的合作
Your partnership with Thanos

32:18.240 --> 32:20.000
已经岌岌可危了
is at risk.

32:20.880 --> 32:24.480
灭霸要见你  现在就见
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

32:29.050 --> 32:31.840
┌

32:29.050 --> 32:31.840
┐

32:29.050 --> 32:31.840
└

32:29.050 --> 32:31.840
┘

32:29.430 --> 32:35.090
<b>圣域</b>

32:29.500 --> 32:35.090
<b>灭霸领地</b>

32:30.440 --> 32:32.400
恕我直言  灭霸
With all due respect, Thanos,

32:32.400 --> 32:34.170
是你女儿惹下的麻烦
your daughter made this mess,

32:34.200 --> 32:35.770
你却传唤我过来
and yet you summon me.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.010
你最好说话小声些  指控者
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

32:38.010 --> 32:39.930
她先是败在一群原始人手下
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.760
灭霸把卡魔拉交由你调遣
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.650
然后还被新星军团送进大牢
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.690
现在空口无凭的人是你
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.

32:46.720 --> 32:50.850
是你的线人说她早已谋划背叛我们
Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time!

32:50.880 --> 32:52.160
放尊重点
Lower your tone!

32:52.360 --> 32:53.360
我虽是你的
I may be your...

33:01.560 --> 33:05.450
我只希望您把这当回事
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.

33:06.560 --> 33:10.280
小子  我不当回事的
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy,

33:10.680 --> 33:11.960
只有你了
is you.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.200
你的政治权术真无聊
Your politics bore me.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.490
你做事像个闹脾气的孩子
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.000
而且很显然
And, apparently,

33:20.650 --> 33:23.470
是你逼走了我最爱的女儿  卡魔拉
you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.850
我会践行我们的约定的  克里人
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

33:28.880 --> 33:30.680
但你务必将宇宙灵球带给我
if you bring me the Orb.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.080
如果下次见我时你再两手空空
But return to me again empty-handed,

33:34.680 --> 33:38.010
我就用你的血染红整个星系
and I will bathe the starways in your blood.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.800
多谢了  父亲  很公平
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.850
这场争斗你赢不了
This is one fight you won't win.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.760
我们去克林吧
Let's head to the Kyln.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.520
如果我们想逃出去
If we're gonna get out of here,

34:00.600 --> 34:02.360
得设法进到那边的瞭望塔里
we're gonna need to get into that watchtower.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.200
为此我需要几件东西
And to do that, I'm gonna need a few things.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.800
警卫都佩戴着安保臂带
The guards wear security bands

34:06.960 --> 34:09.320
来控制人员进出  我要一个
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.160
交给我
Leave it to me.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.170
那边那位  我需要他的假腿
That dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.930
-他的腿  -对
- His leg? - Yeah.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.320
其他的部分我可不需要
God knows I don't need the rest of him.

34:17.330 --> 34:18.160
瞧瞧他  废物
Look at him, he's useless.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.640
好吧
All right.

34:19.800 --> 34:22.030
最后一样  后边的墙上
And finally, on the wall back there

34:22.030 --> 34:24.040
有块黑色面板  闪着黄灯的
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

34:24.200 --> 34:26.250
-瞧见了没  -看见了
- Do you see it? - Yeah.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.430
里面有块柯尼斯电池
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.

34:28.430 --> 34:30.450
紫颜色的  接着绿色电线
Purplish box, green wires.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.690
要想进瞭望塔  我需要这东西
To get into that watchtower, I definitely need it.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.210
要怎么才能拿到
How are we supposed to do that?

34:34.240 --> 34:36.570
这群秃头佬应该觉得你挺美
Well, supposably, these bald-bodies find you attractive.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.290
所以你可以色诱一个
So, maybe you can work out some sort of trade.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.850
你逗乐呢吧
You must be joking.

34:39.850 --> 34:41.410
没有  我真听他们说你挺美
No, I really heard they find you attractive.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.130
你看  那东西离地20英尺
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

34:43.160 --> 34:44.060
而且还处在
and it's in the middle of

34:44.060 --> 34:45.650
一座戒备森严的监狱正中央
the most heavily-guarded part of the prison.

34:45.680 --> 34:48.490
想要不被发现  绝不可能
It's impossible to get up there without being seen.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.610
我想了个计划
I got one plan,

34:49.640 --> 34:51.810
而这计划他妈的还就需要柯尼斯电池
and that plan requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

34:51.840 --> 34:52.970
所以你给我想办法去
so figure it out!

34:54.360 --> 34:56.330
我接着说了哈  多谢
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.330
接下来这点非常重要
Now, this is important.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.970
一旦电池被取下来
Once the battery is removed,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.490
监狱就会进入警戒状态
everything is gonna slam into emergency mode.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.290
所以一旦得手  就必须迅速行动
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

35:05.320 --> 35:08.210
因此务必在最后一步再取下电池
so you definitely need to get that last.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.090
或者先拿电池  再随机应变
Or we could just get it first and improvise.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.200
-我去取臂带  -我去拿腿
- I'll get the armband. - Leg.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.280
囚犯
Prisoner,

35:31.480 --> 35:34.240
立即放下该设备  退回监房
drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell,

35:34.440 --> 35:36.370
否则我们就开火了
or we will open fire.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.400
我  是
I am

35:44.560 --> 35:47.290
格鲁特
Groot!

35:47.440 --> 35:48.800
开火
Fire!

36:01.400 --> 36:03.810
所有囚犯立即返回休息区
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.810
你个白痴
You idiot!

36:10.840 --> 36:13.600
家伙不在手上  我怎么跟这些东西打
How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?

36:19.800 --> 36:21.320
是那动物在指挥
The animal is in control.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.520
听我命令准备开火
Fire on my command!

36:42.960 --> 36:44.320
猥琐的小怪物
Creepy little beast!

36:50.880 --> 36:53.960
这才像话
Yeah.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.720
你想要我的啥
You need my what?

37:23.880 --> 37:25.400
-把这个给我  -请便吧
- I'll need this. - Good luck.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.970
这是内置在体内的
It's internally wired.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.810
我自有办法
I'll figure something out.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.930
把腿放下
Drop the leg!

37:33.960 --> 37:36.560
把腿放下  回到自己监房去
Drop the leg and move back to your cell!

37:51.480 --> 37:52.810
火箭
Rocket!

37:55.600 --> 37:58.000
朝瞭望塔前进
Move to the watchtower!

38:28.960 --> 38:30.000
你
You!

38:31.000 --> 38:32.960
睡过阿斯卡瓦里安人的男人
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

38:34.040 --> 38:36.120
就那么一次而已
It was one time, man.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.490
所有待命警卫请全副武装
We need all available guards in full combat gear...

39:02.840 --> 39:04.330
不要怨恨地盯着我  女人
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.480
这家伙来干什么
Why is this one here?

39:07.040 --> 39:07.920
我们答应了
We promised him he could

39:07.920 --> 39:09.520
让他跟着我们  直到手刃了你老大
stay by your side until he kills your boss.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.970
我向来信守承诺
I always keep my promises,

39:11.000 --> 39:12.690
尤其是面对一个肌肉呆男
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

39:12.720 --> 39:14.360
我不同意就宰了我的时候  给你
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.450
腿我是开玩笑的
I was just kidding about the leg.

39:16.480 --> 39:17.650
我只需要这两样东西
I just need these two things.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.450
-什么  -我就觉着会挺好笑啊
- What? - No, I thought it'd be funny.

39:19.480 --> 39:20.560
多好笑啊
Was it funny?

39:20.720 --> 39:22.450
等等  他单腿跳是个什么样子
Wait, what did he look like hopping around?

39:22.480 --> 39:24.490
我可是花了三万块买的他的腿
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

39:27.320 --> 39:28.600
我们要怎么逃脱
How are we going to leave?

39:30.520 --> 39:32.040
他想好计划了
Well, he's got a plan.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.930
有的吧  难道也是编出来逗人玩的
Right? Or is that another thing you made up?

39:33.960 --> 39:35.480
有计划的  我有计划的
I have a plan! I have a plan!

39:35.680 --> 39:37.250
别再唧唧歪歪的了
Cease your yammering

39:37.400 --> 39:38.970
赶紧带我们冲出这恼人的监牢吧
and relieve us from this irksome confinement.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.480
这回我跟这个活字典
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus

39:40.640 --> 39:42.450
看法相同
on that one.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.960
不准再叫我字典
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

39:45.760 --> 39:46.840
就是个比喻而已  哥们
It's just a metaphor, dude.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.360
他们只能理解字面意思
His people are completely literal.

39:48.360 --> 39:49.890
弄个比喻就绕晕了
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.570
我怎么绕都不晕的
Nothing goes over my head.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.800
我的反应特别快  肯定能走出去
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

39:55.480 --> 39:59.320
我要全银河最蠢的人死在一起了
I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.850
那些枪威力可不小
Those are some big guns.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.320
听我号令
On my command!

40:10.240 --> 40:11.240
第一发
Number one!

40:13.200 --> 40:14.200
耗子  你的计划呢
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

40:14.360 --> 40:16.120
急什么
Hold on!

40:17.160 --> 40:18.960
第二发
Number two!

40:19.840 --> 40:21.690
我认得这种动物
I recognize this animal.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.010
我们小时候会拿来架在火上烤
We'd roast them over a flame pit as children.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.320
肉质相当鲜美
Their flesh was quite delicious.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.600
帮倒忙呢你
Not helping!

40:26.760 --> 40:27.760

52:35.480 --> 52:36.920
什么  不  这只是个...
What? No, that's just a...

52:37.080 --> 52:38.880
-太残忍了  -这只是个俗语
- That is cruel. - It's just a phrase

52:39.040 --> 52:41.240
大家都知道
people use.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.920
旋律挺美的
The melody is pleasant!

53:19.040 --> 53:21.200
-不  -搞什么
- No! - What the hell?

53:21.360 --> 53:22.720
我知道你是什么样的人  彼得·奎尔
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

53:22.880 --> 53:26.080
我是不会中了你的
And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your...

53:26.280 --> 53:28.400
你下贱的巫术的
Your pelvic sorcery!

53:28.600 --> 53:30.000
不是你想的那样
That is not what is happening here.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.920
不是吧
No.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.490
快停下
Stop it!

53:47.880 --> 53:49.120
你在干什么
What are you doing?

53:49.320 --> 53:52.400
这爬虫什么都不懂  还说三道四的
This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!

53:52.560 --> 53:54.480
-我说的都是事实  -他根本不尊重我
- That is true! - He has no respect!

53:54.640 --> 53:57.000
-这也是事实  -慢着  慢着
- That is also true! - Hold on! Hold on!

53:57.160 --> 53:59.160
你再叫我爬虫试试  傻大个
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

53:59.400 --> 54:01.400
你和别人一样都只会嘲笑我
You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!

54:01.560 --> 54:04.130
火箭  你喝醉了  没人嘲笑你
Rocket, you're drunk. All right? No one's laughing at you.

54:04.280 --> 54:07.010
他觉得我是什么可笑的东西  他说的
He thinks I'm some stupid thing! He does!

54:07.160 --> 54:09.160
我也不想被改造啊
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

54:09.680 --> 54:11.680
我也不想被大卸八块
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

54:11.840 --> 54:13.760
然后被拆了又装
and put back together, over and over

54:13.920 --> 54:16.000
最后变成什么
and turned into some...

54:16.280 --> 54:17.280
什么小怪物
Some little monster!

54:17.480 --> 54:19.360
火箭  没人叫你怪物
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

54:19.520 --> 54:21.640
他叫我爬虫
He called me "Vermin"!

54:21.800 --> 54:24.400
她叫我耗子
She called me "Rodent"!

54:24.560 --> 54:25.970
让我们瞧瞧
Let's see if you can laugh

54:26.000 --> 54:29.040
给你脸上来个四五发  你还笑不笑得出
after five or six good shots to your frickin' face!

54:29.240 --> 54:30.650
别  别  别  别
No, no, no, no!

54:30.800 --> 54:32.960
四十亿啊  火箭
Four billion units! Rocket!

54:33.160 --> 54:34.170
想想吧  冷静点
Come on, man. Hey!

54:34.200 --> 54:35.800
忍一忍  再受一晚上的罪
Suck it up for one more lousy night

54:35.800 --> 54:37.010
你就有钱了
and you're rich.

54:45.600 --> 54:46.880
好吧
Fine.

54:47.360 --> 54:48.800
我可不保证这事完了后
But I can't promise, when all this is over

54:48.960 --> 54:50.530
我不会把你们这群混蛋全杀了
I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.

54:50.720 --> 54:54.200
看到没  这就是为什么你们都没朋友
See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends!

54:54.840 --> 54:56.220
跟别的人才认识五秒
Five seconds after you meet somebody,

54:56.220 --> 54:57.530
你就想着要杀了他们了
you're already trying to kill them!

54:57.560 --> 55:01.530
我们穿过了半个星系来到这
We have travelled, halfway across the quadrant.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.680
连罗南的毫毛都没伤着
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

55:06.040 --> 55:08.080
-德拉克斯  -让他去
- Drax! - Let him go.

55:08.280 --> 55:09.480
我们不需要他
We don't need him.

55:12.040 --> 55:13.880
卡魔拉女士
Milady Gamora.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.880
我过来接你去见我主人
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.120
这里一点也不诡异
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

55:24.560 --> 55:27.400
我们的馆藏珍品在整个星系是最多的
We house the galaxy's largest collection

55:28.120 --> 55:30.560
动物  遗骸  不同物种应有尽有
of fauna, relics, and species of all manner.

55:37.240 --> 55:38.800
容我为你们介绍
I present to you,

55:38.920 --> 55:42.600
坦利亚·蒂万  收藏者
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

55:56.400 --> 55:58.520
亲爱的卡魔拉
My dear Gamora.

55:59.320 --> 56:01.720
能见到本尊真是荣幸
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

56:01.960 --> 56:04.440
省掉这些繁文缛节吧  蒂万
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.400
我们有你要的东西
We have what we discussed.

56:08.280 --> 56:12.920
那边那个是什么东西
What is that thing there?

56:13.080 --> 56:14.800
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

56:18.880 --> 56:20.530
我从来没想到能遇见个格鲁特
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

56:20.680 --> 56:22.120
先生
Sir...

56:22.840 --> 56:24.590
请务必把您的尸体卖给我
You must allow me to pay you now

56:24.590 --> 56:26.080
我现在就付款
so that I may own your carcass.

56:26.240 --> 56:29.130
当然了  要等您死后
At the moment of your death, of course.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.520
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

56:30.680 --> 56:33.440
怎么  给你拿去做个椅子吗
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?

56:33.560 --> 56:35.020
这是你的宠物吗
That's your pet?

56:35.880 --> 56:37.530
-他的什么  -蒂万
- His what? - Tivan.

56:38.160 --> 56:41.880
我们穿越大半个银河系  取来了灵球
We have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

56:42.080 --> 56:44.120
非常好  那么
Very well, then.

56:44.280 --> 56:46.760
让我看看你们带来的东西
Let us see what you brought.

57:00.440 --> 57:03.170
三块柯尼斯电池  七箱科他蒂种子
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of Cotati seeds.

57:03.320 --> 57:06.730
不  要七箱  上次你寄过来的
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

57:08.320 --> 57:11.240
你得帮我传达个信息
You shall send a message for me.

57:11.640 --> 57:13.700
我的新朋友们
My new friends.

57:14.440 --> 57:17.560
在宇宙开创之前
Before creation itself,

57:17.720 --> 57:19.440
一共有六个奇点
there were six singularities.

57:21.680 --> 57:25.400
然后宇宙大爆炸创造了万物
Then the universe exploded into existence,

57:25.560 --> 57:27.600
这六个奇点的残留物
and the remnants of these systems

57:27.760 --> 57:31.200
被收集起来凝炼成宝石
were forged into concentrated ingots.

57:31.960 --> 57:34.240
称作无限宝石
Infinity Stones.

57:35.400 --> 57:36.890
这些宝石似乎
These stones, it seems,

57:37.040 --> 57:38.880
只有拥有非凡的力量
can only be brandished

57:39.040 --> 57:42.520
才能驾驭
by beings of extraordinary strength.

57:42.680 --> 57:43.720
请看
Observe.

57:46.920 --> 57:52.810
这些携带者借助宝石能摧毁整个文明
These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations

57:52.840 --> 57:56.360
跟收麦子一样易如反掌
like wheat in a field.

57:57.840 --> 58:00.120
我已经快吓尿了
There's a little pee coming out of me right now.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.160
曾经有那么一次
Once, for a moment,

58:02.320 --> 58:06.370
一个组织成功地共同控制了这股能量
a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves,

58:06.520 --> 58:09.490
但即使是他们也很快被这力量摧毁了
but even they were quickly destroyed by it.

58:15.640 --> 58:17.360
太美了
Beautiful.

58:19.160 --> 58:21.690
无与伦比
Beyond compare.

58:23.800 --> 58:26.270
我们都沉醉其中了  白毛
We're all very fascinated, whitey.

58:26.270 --> 58:27.780
但是快给钱
But we'd like to get paid.

58:29.400 --> 58:30.760
你们希望用什么方式付款
How would you like to get paid?

58:30.920 --> 58:33.510
你说呢  花花公子  当然是现金
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

58:34.440 --> 58:35.520
很好
Very well, then.

58:41.120 --> 58:42.480
卡瑞娜
Carina.

58:42.800 --> 58:43.800
别靠近
Stand back.

58:44.440 --> 58:47.120
我再也不要做你的奴隶了
I will no longer be your slave!

58:47.280 --> 58:48.720
不
No!

59:36.040 --> 59:37.120
我了个
What the...

59:47.040 --> 59:47.860
我怎么会相信蒂万
How could I think Tivan

59:47.860 --> 59:49.360
知道如何控制宇宙灵球里的东西
could contain whatever was within the Orb?

59:49.480 --> 59:51.610
你还拿着是要做什么
What do you still have it for?

59:51.640 --> 59:53.010
不然怎么办  留在那儿吗
What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

59:53.040 --> 59:55.580
你竟然还装进自己的荷包里了
I can't believe you had that in your purse!

59:55.680 --> 59:57.420
这是个背包  不是荷包
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

59:57.420 --> 59:59.170
我们必须把这个交给新星军团
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.000
他们可能知道如何控制它
There's a chance they can contain it.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.280
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.800
我们正在被新星军团通缉
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800
把它交给罗南就是了
Just give it to Ronan!

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.510
然后帮他毁了整个银河系吗
So he can destroy the galaxy?

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:08.320
怎么了你  突然变成圣人了吗
What are you, some saint all of a sudden?

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.020
银河系帮过你吗
What has the galaxy ever done for you?

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.450
你为什么想救它
Why would you wanna save it?

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:13.210
因为我就生活在这里面啊
Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.730
彼得  听我说
Peter, listen to me.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.960
绝不能让宝石落入罗南之手
We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.720
我们现在就回你飞船
We have to go back to your ship,

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.370
然后送去新星
and deliver it to Nova.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.920
好的  就这样  你说得对
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.190
或者我们可以把它交给某个
Or we could give it to somebody

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.640
不会逮捕我们的
who's not going to arrest us,

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.040
大好人
who's really nice

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.880
然后大赚一笔
for a whole lot of money.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:32.970
我觉得这是个
I think it's a really good

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:34.560
能两全其美的好方法
balance between both of your points of view.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.720
你太卑鄙
You're despicable.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.400
太无耻
Dishonorable.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.040
毫无信用
Faithless!

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.330
-不  -终于
- No. - At last!

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.360
我要面对我的仇敌并且亲手解决他了
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.240
是你叫来了罗南
You called Ronan?

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.120
奎尔  别想跑  小子
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.400
你敢跑  别挡道
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.810
指控者罗南
Ronan the Accuser!

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.570
是你传送的信息吗
You are the one who transmitted the message?

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:09.770
你杀了我妻子
You killed my wife.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.520
你杀了我女儿
You killed my daughter!

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.760
我都说了  你进不来的
I told you, you can't fit.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.800
在这儿等我回来
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.760
是卡魔拉  她带着宇宙灵球逃走了
It is Gamora. She is escaping with the Orb.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.210
不
No!

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.320
星云
Nebula,

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.810
去夺回宇宙灵球
retrieve the Orb.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.240
宝石在最前面那个作业舱里
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.200
击落它
Bring it down!

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.920
火箭  掩护卡魔拉到米拉诺号
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.480
怎么掩护  这上面又没有武器
How? We've got no weaponry on these things.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.500
这些作业舱都是工业级的
These pods are industrial grade.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.120
基本上坚不可摧
They're nearly indestructible.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.390
那也吃不消死灵炮啊
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.160
我可不是那个意思
That's not what I'm saying.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.320
借你飞船用一用
Let me borrow your ride.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.920
我不记得杀过你家人
I don't recall killing your family.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.600
大概也不会记得杀过你
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.080
奎尔  我被困住了  到不了米拉诺号
Quill, I'm trapped. I can't make it to the Milano.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.960
只能冲去外层空间了
I have to head out.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.160
等等  这些作业舱不能飞到外层空间去
Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there.

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.120
你太让我失望了  姐姐
You are a disappointment, sister.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.800
在所有姐妹当中
Of all our siblings,

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.160
我最不讨厌的就是你
I hated you least.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.840
星云  别这样
Nebula, please.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.640
如果罗南得到了宝石
If Ronan gets this stone

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.800
-他会杀光我们所有人  -不是所有人
- He'll kill us all. - Not all.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.200
你活不到那时候
You will already be dead.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.760
罗南  东西到手了
Ronan, it is done.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.800
奎尔  算了
Quill, come on.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.840
她的身体改造过  大概能撑几分钟
Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
可我们没办法救她
but there's nothing we can do for her.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.720
这些作业舱在外面坚持不了多久的
These pods aren't meant to be out here.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.240
很快  我们也会像她一样
In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.080
去他的
Aw, damn it.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.840
奎尔
Quill?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.760
勇度  勇度
Yondu! Yondu.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.210
我是奎尔
This is Quill!

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.800
-我现在的坐标是227K324  -奎尔
- My coordinates are 227K324. - Quill.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.200
奎尔  你在干什么
Quill, what are you doing?

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.810
就在无存知地外面
Just outside Knowhere.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.080
如果你在的话  就来抓我吧
If you're there, come get me.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.290
我随你处置
I'm all yours.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.720
奎尔  别犯傻
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.440
回你的作业舱里去
Get back into your pod!

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.880
里面装不下两个人  你会死的
You can't fit two people in there. You're gonna die.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.960
你马上就会死的
You'll die in seconds!

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.440
奎尔
Quill.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.170
奎尔
Quill?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.330
怎么了
What happened?

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.520
我看见你漂浮在外面
I saw you out there.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.400
我也不知道自己怎么了
I don't know what came over me.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.200
我不能眼睁睁让你死
But I couldn't let you die.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.440
我突然感受到了内心深处的一种
I found something inside of myself.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.050
一种
Something

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.980
难以置信的英雄气概
incredibly heroic.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.440
我不是在夸自己
I mean, not to brag,

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.920
可是  客观地说
but, objectively...

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.040
宇宙灵球呢
Where's the Orb?

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.120
他们把宇宙灵球抢走了
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.320
什么
What?

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.520
欢迎回家  彼得
Welcome home, Peter.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.160
蠢货  全是无可救药的蠢货
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.760
奎尔竟然自投罗网了
Quill just got himself captured.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.560
要不是你
None of this ever would have

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.200
一意孤行  非要去单挑罗南
happened if you didn't try to single-handedly

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.600
这一切都不会发生
take on a frickin' army!

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.600
你说得没错
You're right.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.400
我是个傻瓜
I was a fool.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.560
所有的愤怒
All the anger,

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.040
所有的怨气
all the rage,

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.520
都是为了掩饰我的伤痛
was just to cover my loss.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:59.440
"我的老婆孩子都死了"
Boo-hoo-hoo. "My wife and child are dead."

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.200
我才不在乎这有多残忍
I don't care if it's mean!

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.240
谁家没死过人
Everybody's got dead people.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.570
不代表你就有理由让大家
It's no excuse to get everybody else

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.640
陪你一起送死
dead along the way!

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.120
好了  格鲁特  罗南拿到了宝石
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.400
我们现在唯一能做的
The only chance we got

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.610
就是赶紧飞往宇宙另一头去
is to get to the other side of the universe

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.520
越快越好
as fast as we can and maybe,

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.300
也许趁着那神经病还没打过来
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.320
能安稳的过一辈子
before that whack-job ever gets there.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.160
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.600
救他们  怎么救
Save them? How?

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.520
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.420
我知道他们是我们唯一的朋友
I know they're the only friends that we ever had,

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.170
可他们现在落在掠夺者军队手里
but there's an army of Ravagers around them.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.970
我们只有两个人
And there's only two of us!

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.240
是三个
Three.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.560
我都被你们气得
You're making me

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.290
只能  拿草
beat...up

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480
撒气了
grass!

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.720
宇宙灵球已经在我手里了
The Orb is in my possession,

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.360
我说到做到
as I promised.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.040
把它送到我这里来
Bring it to me.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.520
没错  这是我们之前约定好的
Yes, that was our agreement.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.930
我帮你拿来宇宙灵球
Bring you the Orb,

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.640
你帮我毁灭山达尔
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.360
不过  既然我知道了它装有无限宝石
However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone,

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.520
我很好奇我还要你做什么
I wonder what use I have for you.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.200
小子
Boy,

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.110
你最好给我想清楚了
I would reconsider your current course.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.360
主人  你不能这么做
Master! You cannot!

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.040
灭霸是这宇宙中最强大的存在
Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.330
不再是了
Not anymore.

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.400
你竟然叫我"小子"
You call me "Boy!"

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.800
我会代表克里
I will unfurl

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.120
对千年来山达尔的所作所为进行审判
1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar,

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.800
让它消失殆尽
and burn it to its core!

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.920
之后  灭霸
Then, Thanos,

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.040
我就去找你算账
I am coming for you.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.320
毁灭山达尔之后  你会杀掉我父亲吗
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.640
你想反抗我吗
You dare to oppose me?

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.690
你也看到他对我做了些什么
You see what he has turned me into.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.960
你杀了他  我会再帮你毁灭一千个星球
If you kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.280
你敢背叛我?
You betray me?

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.200
偷我的钱?
Steal my money?

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.920
住手  放开他
Stop it! Leave him alone!

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.400
你小时候刚被我捡到的时候
When I picked you up as a kid,

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.880
这些小子想吃了你
these boys wanted to eat you.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.480
他们还没尝过地星人的味道呢
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.410
是我救了你
I saved your life!

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.590
还有完没完啊  天哪
Will you shut up about that? God!

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.130
二十年了  一直给我说这些陈芝麻烂谷子
Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face,

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.930
好像没有吃掉我是件多么伟大的事
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.520
正常人哪会每天想着吃人啊
Normal people don't even think about eating someone else!

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.160
不吃我难道我还得谢你吗
Much less that person having to be grateful for it!

01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.960
是你劫持了我
You abducted me, man.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.720
把我从家里掳走  害我无亲无故
You stole me from my home and from my family.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.000
你他妈才不是因为在乎你们地星
You don't give a damn about your Terra!

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520
你害怕
You're scared

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.850
不过是因为内心太懦弱了
because you're soft in here.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.960
这里  就在这里
Here, right here!

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.320
勇度
Yondu!

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.770
听我说
Listen to me.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.040
罗南掌握着一块叫无限宝石的东西
Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.960
我知道他手里有什么  小姑娘
I know what he's got, girl.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.440
那你就该知道  我们必须把它抢回来
Then you know we must get it back!

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.000
他会用宝石摧毁掉山达尔
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.550
我们得警告他们
We have to warn them.

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:26.250
否则无数的人会因此丧命
Billions of people will perish.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.970
她就是这样给你洗脑的吗  小子
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.120
多愁善感
Sentiment?

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.490
蛆虫一样蚕食掉你的大脑
Eating away your brain like maggots!

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.490
就这样吧
That's it.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.200
不
No!

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.760
抱歉了  小子
Sorry, boy.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.710
身为队长  必须杀一儆百
But a captain's gotta teach his men

01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:46.440
让手下知道背叛会是什么下场
what happens to those what cross him.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.200
队长要以身作则
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.920
如果你现在杀了我
If you kill me now,

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.210
就别想做成这辈子最大一笔生意了
you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen.

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.770
无限宝石吗
The Stone?

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.480
你最好能想出个别的
I hope you got something better than that.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.290
没有人能从罗南手里偷东西
Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.770
我们有秘密武器
We got a ringer.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.370
是吗
Is that right?

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.880
她清楚有关罗南的一切
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.280
他的舰队
His ships,

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.010
他的部下
his army.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.000
他也有弱点
He's vulnerable.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.170
你觉得怎么样  勇度
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.760
我和你  还跟以前一样  携手作战
Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:36.560
放开他
Let him go!

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.800
你小子一向有种
You always did have a scrote, boy!

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.730
所以我当时才留你在身边
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.960
队长  这种攻击不痛不痒的
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.320
请注意  蠢货们
Attention, idiots.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.200
飞船上这个疯子手里拿着的是强子枪
The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.080
我独家设计的武器
It's a weapon of my own design.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.360
这是在搞什么
What the hell?

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.520
要是你们不赶紧交出我朋友
If you don't hand over our companions now,

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.000
他就把你们的飞船轰出个新鲜的洞
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.920
又大又新鲜的洞
A very big new one!

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.920
-老子才不买你的账  -我倒数五下
- I ain't buyin' it. - I'm giving you to the count of five.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.600
-5  4  3  -别  等一下
- 5, 4, 3... - No! Wait, hold on!

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.520
火箭  是我  真是的
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:23.680
已经谈拢了  我们没事了
We figured it out! We're fine!

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.400
奎尔  怎么回事
Hey, Quill. What's going on?

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.650
这就叫"谈拢了"
You call that "Figured it out"?

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.830
要从那群把我们
We're gonna rob the guys

01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:31.240
打得屁滚尿流的家伙手里抢东西
who just beat us senseless.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.650
你还有脸说屁滚尿流
You want to talk about senseless?

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:35.050
你到底是想救我们还是想把我们炸飞
How about trying to save us by blowing us up?

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.750
他们要是不交出你们
We were only gonna blow you up

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:37.970
我才会把他们炸飞
if they didn't turn you over!

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.800
你只数五下
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.520
他们哪有时间交出我们
when you only gave them a count of five?

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.960
我们又没空考虑倒数时间
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.170
那些细节
of the plan.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.570
我们为朋友两肋插刀就这下场
This is what we get for acting altruistically.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.680
-我是格鲁特  -他们根本不领情
- I am Groot. - They are ungrateful.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.960
重点是
What's important now

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.770
我们说服了掠夺者军队
is we get the Ravagers' army

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.170
帮我们拯救山达尔
to help us save Xandar.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.730
然后我们再把宝石交给勇度
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.780
好让他卖给一个更邪恶的家伙吗
who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.200
这个之后再议
We'll figure that part out later.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.010
我们必须阻止罗南
We have to stop Ronan.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.480
怎么阻止
How?

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.770
我有个计划
I have a plan.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.800
你有个计划?
You've got a plan?

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.320
没错
Yes.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:07.920
首先  那句话是我说的
First of all, you're copying me from

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.450
-你算是抄袭  -哪有
- when I said I had a plan. - No, I'm not.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.860
这话谁都会说
People say that all the time.

01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.570
又没什么特别的
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.440
其次  我不相信你有什么计划
Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:17.330
我有一部分计划
I have part of a plan!

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.000
一部分是多少
What percentage of a plan do you have?

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.570
鉴于你在无存知地的表现
You don't get to ask questions

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.320
你没有权利提问
after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.130
我可救了奎尔
I just saved Quill.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.210
我们已经讨论过了
We've already established

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.080
你们想炸了我乘坐的飞船  那可不是在救我
that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.130
我们什么时候讨论过了
When did we establish it?

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:29.160
就几秒钟以前
Like three seconds ago!

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.400
我没在仔细听  那会儿正走神
I wasn't listening. I was thinking of something else.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.520
她说得没错  你没有发表意见的权利
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.000
你有百分之多少的计划
What percentage?

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.570
我不知道  百分之十二吧
I don't know. Twelve percent.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.010
百分之十二?
Twelve percent?

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.080
你笑得真假
That's a fake laugh.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.050
-是真的  -太假了
- It's real! - Totally fake.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.340
这是我这辈子笑得最真实
That is the most real, authentic,

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:47.680
最歇斯底里的一次了
hysterical laugh of my entire life

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.190
因为你这是狗屁计划
because that is not a plan.

01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:50.450
只能算是一个想法
It's barely a concept.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.600
你站到他们那一边去了吗
You're taking their side?

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.960
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.530
是比百分之十一要强点  又怎样
So what, it's better than 11%?

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.130
你那狗屁计划能有什么用
What the hell does that have to do with anything?

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.360
谢谢你  格鲁特  谢谢
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.320
格鲁特是你们当中唯一一个明事理的
See? Groot's the only one of you who has a clue.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360
伙伴们
Guys.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.280
拜托
Come on.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.530
勇度马上就要过来了
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.040
他还想听听我们的大计划呢
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.360
我需要你们的帮助
I need your help.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.400
看看我们
I look around at us.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:23.920
知道我看到了什么吗
You know what I see?

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.320
一群失败者
Losers.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.130
我们就像
I mean, like,

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.290
一群失魂落魄的家伙
folks who have lost stuff.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.480
确实如此  我们所有人都失去过
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.930
失去了家
Our homes,

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.050
失去了家人
our families,

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.080
失去了正常的生活
normal lives.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.980
没错  生活本来就是付出比回报更多
And, usually, life takes more than it gives.

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.210
可今天不是
But not today.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.320
今天我们得到了眷顾
Today, it's given us something.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.050
生活给了我们一个机会
It has given us a chance.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.560
什么机会
To do what?

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.760
去拼一回
To give a shit.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.320
仅此一回
For once.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.520
不要逃避
Not run away.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.890
罗南要屠杀无数无辜的生命
I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.000
而我  绝不会袖手旁观
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.720
可是  奎尔  想要阻止罗南
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.840
是不可能的
it's impossible.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.640
你是在叫我们去送死
You're asking us to die.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.200
是啊  应该是吧
Yeah, I guess I am.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.160
奎尔
Quill.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.680
我活了这么久  只跟敌人打过交道
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:54.930
我愿意和朋友共生死
I will be grateful to die among my friends.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.380
你是个有担当的男人  奎尔
You are an honorable man, Quill.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.080
我愿意跟你并肩作战
I will fight beside you.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.800
最后
And in the end,

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.800
我就能和我的妻女团聚了
I will see my wife and daughter again.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:20.920
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:34.480
随你们吧  反正本来我也活不长
What the hell. I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.720
我也站起来了  你们满意了吧
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.360
现在我们都站起来了
We're all standing up now.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.850
一群傻缺  站成个圈圈
Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.560
宝石会对任何有机体产生反应
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.810
目标越大  威力越强
The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:00.890
罗南只需要让宝石
All Ronan's got to do is

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:03.000
接触到星球的表面  它就会毁掉一切
touch the Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.810
所有的植物  动物
All plants, animals,

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.720
-新星军团  -一切都将被毁灭
- Nova Corps. - Everything will die.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.040
所以不能让罗南登陆
So Ronan does not make the surface.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.960
火箭带领一队人马在暗黑星号右舷
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.280
轰开一个洞
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.570
这样我们和勇度的飞船就可以攻进去了
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.450
里面有上百个萨卡士兵把守吧
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.320
萨卡士兵都是纸做的
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.640
他们一旦得知我们登陆了
Once they know we're on board,

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.020
罗南会关上舱内的安全门
Ronan will isolate himself

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:37.170
把自己隔离起来
behind impenetrable security doors on deck.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.640
我可以通过破坏动力系统解锁
Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.570
接着我们进到驾驶舱
We'll make it to the flight deck,

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.020
用强子枪把罗南轰上天
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.240
罗南一死我们就回收宝石
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.280
记得要把它装进这些装置里
Use these devices to contain it.

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:54.990
别直接触摸
If you touch it,

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.620
不然小命就没了
it will kill you.

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.620
我会联络之前逮捕过我们的新星警官
I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.780
但愿他们相信我们是来帮忙的
Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.

01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:05.670
正在呼入

01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:05.670
彼得·奎尔

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:09.240
完成计划还需要最后一步
There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.200
那家伙的眼睛
That guy's eye.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.590
不  瞎说什么呢
No! No, we don't.

01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:16.130
我们不需要那家伙的眼睛
No, we don't need that guy's eye.

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:19.840
不  说真的  对我来说相当重要呢
No, seriously, I need it! It's important to me.

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.250
已发现罗南舰队
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.280
预计十五分钟后抵达
and will arrive in T-minus fifteen minutes.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.050
听好了  小子
Remember, boy.

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:33.360
这事完了之后
At the end of all this,

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.950
宝石归我
I get the Stone.

01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:37.780
敢耍我就砍死你们
You cross me, we kill you all.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.370
准备大干一场吧  小子们
Let's go get 'em, boys!

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:11.940
这计划烂死了
This is a terrible plan.

01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:14.720
不是你说要和朋友共生死的吗
Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:20.990
新星至尊
Nova Prime.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.620
一个掠夺者刚刚给我传达了一则消息
I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.880
他说罗南得到了一颗什么无限宝石
He says Ronan's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.370
正冲着山达尔来
and he's headed toward Xandar.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.250
老天爷
Good God.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.680
不过是个幌子  别忘了他是罪犯
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.170
他有说我们为什么要相信他吗
Did he say why we should believe him?

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.560
他说他们一帮人刚刚越狱
He said his crew just escaped from prison,

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.730
如果不是为了拯救山达尔没理由冒险
so he'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.140
他说他确实是个
He says that he's an...

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:44.980
"混球"
"A-hole."

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.360
但不是一个
But he's not...

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.280
引用他原话就是
and I'm quoting him, here,

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.600
"彻头彻尾的混蛋"
"100% a dick."

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.270
你信他吗
Do you believe him?

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.650
我也不知道有没有彻头彻尾的混蛋  夫人
I don't know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.800
我是问  你相信他是来帮忙的吗
I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.520
信啊
Yeah.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.090
不明舰队逼近中
A fleet approaches.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.120
看起来像是掠夺者
They appear to be Ravagers.

01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:29.400
开火
Fire!

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.800
掩护就位
Cover it down.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.880
全体下潜
Submerge!

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.380
火箭  快上
Rocket, hurry!

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.770
全体飞行员下潜
All pilots, dive!

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.080
他们在我们正下方
They're beneath us!

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.330
疏散全体市民
Evacuate the city.

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:20.960
我们的首要任务是确保人民安全撤离
Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.790
全速推进  动作快
Forward thrust, now!

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.520
加把劲儿
Come on!

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.840
奎尔  勇度  趁现在
Quill! Yondu! Now!

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.650
妈的
Aw, hell!

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.280
我被击落了  奎尔
I'm going down, Quill!

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.160
别给我耍花招  小子
No more games with me, boy!

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:16.920
完事之后我们再会
I'll see you at the end of this!

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.300
他们人太多了  火箭
There are too many of them, Rocket!

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.440
我们没法突围
We'll never make it up there!

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.600
彼得·奎尔
Peter Quill.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.160
我是新星军团的丹纳利安·萨尔
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:49.600
先声明一下  我始终认为不该相信你
For the record, I advised against trusting you here.

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.120
看来我的"混蛋"消息他们收到了
They got my "Dick" Message!

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.720
用事实证明我错了吧
Prove me wrong.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.080
爽
Yes!

01:26:23.490 --> 01:26:24.650
够嗨
Yes!

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.560
我们和凯文·贝肯差不多厉害吧
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.410
右舷核心部位受创
The starboard kern has been breached!

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:36.740
他们闯进来了
We have been boarded.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.170
继续向前推进
Continue our approach.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.600
但是新星军团也掺合进来了
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:42.410
着陆之后一切就都不是问题了
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.520
关闭所有安全门
Seal security doors!

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.850
赶紧
Now!

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.010
别挡老娘的路
Get out of my way!

01:26:59.730 --> 01:27:01.610
老天
Oh, man.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.360
所有新星飞行员听令
All Nova pilots,

01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:06.200
全体对接形成封锁网
interlock and form a blockade.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.120
务必阻止暗黑星号着陆
The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.840
已锁入
Locked in!

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.840
已锁入
Locked in.

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.400
已锁入
We're locked in.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.880
我什么都看不见
I can barely see.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.960
你什么时候学了这一招
When did you learn to do that?

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.600
我猜答案肯定是
Pretty sure the answer is

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.360
"我是格鲁特"
"I am Groot."

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.040
飞行甲板就在前方300米处
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:47.920
我希望你们知道
I want you all to know that

01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:49.690
感谢你们  不在意我的鲁莽之举
I am grateful for your acceptance

01:28:49.690 --> 01:28:50.730
依然接受我
after my blunders.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.400
再次有朋友相伴的感觉...
It is pleasing to once again have...

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.040
真棒
friends.

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.050
奎尔  你是我朋友
You, Quill, are my friend.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.280
谢了
Thanks.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.210
这颗蠢树也是我朋友
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.920
还有这个绿婊子也
And this green whore, she, too...

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.560
给我闭嘴
You must stop!

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.200
卡魔拉  看看你干的好事
Gamora, look at what you have done.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.880
你还是一如既往的软弱
You have always been weak.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.280
愚蠢  背信弃...
You stupid, traitorous...

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.760
不要这么跟我朋友说话
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.000
你们去飞行甲板
Head to the flight deck.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.810
我去切断安全门的动力
I'll shut down the power to the security doors.

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.600
勇度·尤冬塔
Yondu Udonta.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.810
命令自己的手下向新星军团投降
Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps.

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.560
玩够了没  掠夺者
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.520
你的死期到...
Time to die...

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.870
星云  别这样
Nebula, please.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.460
够了  死灵舰队飞行员
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.010
开始自我献祭吧
enact immolation initiative.

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.850
他们冲下去轰炸城市了
They're dive-bombing the city!

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.680
丹纳利安·萨尔  需要解除连锁吗
Denarian Saal, should we break formation?

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.490
不行  保持阵形
No! Hold your positions.

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.510
拖住罗南  萨尔
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.370
下面市民的安全交给我们了
We'll take care of the people down here.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.600
我居然要听命于一只小仓鼠
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.350
星爵
Star-Lord.

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:49.690
终于记住了
Finally.

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.480
你个卑鄙的贼
You thief!

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:16.200
你们休想攻到罗南那儿去
You will never make it to Ronan.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:24.200
在死灵舰着陆之前就把他们轰下来
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.200
来吧
Come on!

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:20.520
手指划过喉咙就是杀人
Finger to the throat means death.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.770
我用比喻了
Metaphor.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.200
差不多吧
Yeah, sorta.

01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.520
不是吧
Oh, no.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:59.930
山达尔
Xandar!

01:34:00.210 --> 01:34:03.250
接受制裁吧
You stand accused.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:08.370
可悲的和平条约也救不了你们了
Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now.

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.580
跟条约一起葬身火海吧
It is the tinder on which you burn.

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:37.760
火箭
Rocket!

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.720
坚持住  萨尔  再坚...
Hold on, Saal, just...

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.680
奎尔  你得快点了
Quill, you gotta hurry.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.530
市民倒是都被疏散了
The city's been evacuated,

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:11.890
可我们还在苦战呢
but we're getting our asses kicked down here.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.680
卡魔拉还没把门打开
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:39.960
星云
Nebula!

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:43.800
妹妹  帮我们一起打败罗南吧
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.460
你很清楚他就是个疯子
You know he's crazy.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.470
你们俩都是疯子
I know you're both crazy.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.000
不
No!

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:52.300
什么鬼...
What the...?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:54.890
滚出去
Get out!

01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:38.390
你成功了
You did it!

01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:05.970
之前我错了
I was mistaken.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.090
我确实记得你家人
I do remember your family.

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:09.960
她们临死时的叫声
Their screams were

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.240
那么可悲  我
pitiful. I...

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.480
不  格鲁特
No, Groot!

01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:12.250
别这样
You can't.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.770
你会死的
You'll die.

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.160
为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:17.430
为什么
Why?

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.180
我们
We...

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.600
是
are...

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.190
格鲁特
Groot.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:36.000
真是个白痴
I called him an idiot.

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.640
是你杀了格鲁特
You killed Groot!

01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:06.130
看吧
Behold!

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.330
看这支银河护卫队
Your guardians of the galaxy.

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.960
你们护卫了什么
What fruit have they wrought?

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:17.290
现在我终于得偿所愿
Only that my father and his father

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:20.880
为我父亲和爷爷报了仇
shall finally know vengeance.

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.280
山达尔的子民
People of Xandar,

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.260
背弃你们卑微的信仰
the time has come to rejoice

01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:31.300
迎接我的时刻到了
and renounce your paltry gods!

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.440
你们即将得到救赎
Your salvation is at hand.

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:49.200
听这几句
Listen to these words.

01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:00.050
用力舞起来
Now bring it down hard!

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.680
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.770
比舞啊  老兄  就我们俩
Dance-off, Bro. Me and you.

01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:12.060
卡魔拉
Gamora.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.190
委婉拒绝  收回邀请
Subtle. Take it back.

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.360
你到底在搞什么鬼
What are you doing?

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:21.050
分你的心啊  大蠢蛋
I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.730
不
No!

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:17.000
彼得  握住我的手
Peter! Take my hand!

01:43:21.130 --> 01:43:23.210
握住我的手  彼得
Take my hand, Peter.

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:25.300
妈妈
Mom.

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:28.640
握住我的手
Take my hand!

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.940
你们只是凡人
You're mortal!

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:25.900
怎么可能
How?

01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:28.450
你不是说过吗  婊子
You said it yourself, bitch.

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.890
我们可是银河护卫队
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.190
不错  不错
Well, well, well.

01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:04.480
好一场光影盛宴
Quite the light show.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.900
大团圆结局啊
Ain't this sweet.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.320
不过在你们嘿咻嘿咻之前
But you got some business to attend to

01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:14.160
先给我把正事办了
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.040
彼得  你不能给他
Peter, you can't. Peter.

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:20.240
你得三思  勇度
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.210
我不知道你要把它卖给谁
I don't know who you're selling this to,

01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:24.250
不过能让宇宙安定平稳的唯一方法
but the only way the universe can survive

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:26.670
就是把它交给新星军团保管
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.760
都说我长得像菩萨
I may be as pretty as an angel,

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.760
可我没有菩萨心肠
but I sure as hell ain't one.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.680
快交给我吧  孩子
Hand it over, son.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:54.360
勇度
Yondu.

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.330
决不能打开宇宙灵球  你知道的吧
Do not open that Orb. You know that, right?

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:03.800
你也看见它的威力了
You've seen what it does to people.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:16.800
奎尔这小子还挺懂事
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:19.930
当初没有按他爹的要求把他送过去
It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad

01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:21.400
也许是个正确的决定
like we was hired to do.

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:24.250
是啊  他爹就是个混球
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.110
等他发现宇宙灵球被我掉包了
He is gonna be so pissed when he realizes

01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:32.730
非气炸不可
I switched out the Orb on him.

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:37.530
他一定会砍死你  彼得
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:40.160
是啊
Oh, I know.

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.460
不过他也算是我唯一的亲人了
But he was about the only family I had.

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.600
不
No.

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:50.080
不止是他
He wasn't.

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.890
你们怎么连这个都知道
Why would you even know this?

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:40.900
当初抓你回来后
When we arrested you,

01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:42.810
我们发现你的神经系统有些异常
we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system,

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.520
于是帮你做了检查
so we had it checked out.

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.230
所以我不是地星人
I'm not Terran?

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:48.840
有一半血统来自地星
You are half Terran.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.640
你母亲是地球人  至于你父亲
Your mother was of Earth. Your father, well,

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.360
他是某种我们从未接触过的远古生灵
he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:57.400
怪不得
That could be why

01:47:57.430 --> 01:48:00.240
你握着宝石那么久却没事
you were able to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:03.200
你的朋友们来齐了
Your friends have arrived.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.080
我谨代表新星军团
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:10.040
向你们致以最真诚的谢意
we'd like to express our profound gratitude

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:12.880
谢谢你们拯救了山达尔
for your help in saving Xandar.

01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:16.510
你们可以跟随丹纳利安·戴
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.160
他有东西要带你们看
he has something to show you.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.630
谢谢了  新星至尊
Thank you, Nova Prime.

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.060
你帮妻女报了仇
Your wife and child shall rest well

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.400
现在她们能安息了
knowing that you have avenged them.

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:34.840
是啊
Yes.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.920
不过说到底罗南只是个傀儡
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.200
得杀掉灭霸才算报仇
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:45.280
我们想保留它原本的样子
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible.

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.840
已经尽全力做了相关修复了
We salvaged as much as we could.

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:51.960
我
I...

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.080
多谢了
Thank you.

01:48:56.710 --> 01:48:58.210
我也有妻儿
I have a family.

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.630
多亏你她们才能活下来
They're alive because of you.

01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:07.350
你们的犯罪记录已经被抹掉了
Your criminal records have also been expunged.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.520
不过还是得提醒你们
However, I have to warn

01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:11.480
遵纪守法才是好公民
you against breaking any laws in the future.

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:12.730
问一下
Question.

01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:14.440
如果我拿了一件很想要的
What if I see something that I want to take,

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.850
刚好又属于别人的东西呢
and it belongs to someone else?

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.210
你会被逮捕
You will be arrested.

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:19.480
可如果我比物主更想要那东西呢
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:21.780
-还是违法的  -说不通啊
- It's still illegal. - That doesn't follow.

01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:23.660
我更想要啊  长官  你懂吗
No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand?

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:24.620
笑什么
What are you laughing at?

01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:26.610
干嘛拉我走  我不能和这位先生聊聊吗
Why? I can't have a discussion with this gentleman?

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.480
如果谁把我惹毛了
What if someone does something irksome

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:31.000
然后我决定要抽了他的脊椎呢
and I decide to remove his spine?

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.480
那个
That's...

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.380
那个应该算谋杀了
That's actually murder.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.170
最恶劣的犯罪之一
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:44.160
所以  也是违法的
So... also illegal.

01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.390
他们会老实待着的  戴
They'll be fine, Dey.

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:50.810
我会看好他们的
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:51.840
你
You?

01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.690
对啊  我
Yeah. Me.

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:18.760
彼得
Peter,

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:22.880
我知道最近几个月对你来说很痛苦
I know these last few months have been hard for you.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.570
其实我只是要去个更好的地方
But I'm going to a better place.

01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:29.200
我会照顾好自己的
And I will be okay.

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:33.080
我会永远陪在你身边
And I will always be with you.

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:37.480
你是我生命的曙光
You are the light of my life.

01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:39.880
我挚爱的儿子
My precious son.

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:43.760
我的小星爵
My little Star-Lord.

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.480
永远爱你的妈妈
Love, Mom.

01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:16.480
劲歌金曲  第二辑

01:52:46.930 --> 01:52:48.690
那么接下来做什么呢
So, what should we do next?

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.740
干点好事
Something good?

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.410
干点坏事
Something bad?

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:54.330
还是都干一点
A bit of both?

01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:58.840
你说了算  星爵
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.
