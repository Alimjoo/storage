00:06.160 --> 00:10.710
在最初

00:10.910 --> 00:14.830
在六个奇异点和创世黎明之前

00:15.040 --> 00:18.050
天神族至尊阿里瑟姆便已出现

00:18.210 --> 00:22.090
创造了第一个太阳 将光带入宇宙

00:22.260 --> 00:25.890
生命开始蓬勃发展 万物处于平衡

00:26.050 --> 00:30.140
直到一种不自然的掠食物种出现

00:30.310 --> 00:33.690
以智慧生命为食

00:33.850 --> 00:38.400
它们叫变异族 宇宙因而陷入浑沌

00:38.570 --> 00:40.400
为了恢复自然秩序

00:40.570 --> 00:42.400
阿里瑟姆派出永恒族

00:42.570 --> 00:44.820
来自奥林匹亚星的不死英雄

00:44.990 --> 00:47.280
歼灭变异族

00:47.450 --> 00:52.370
永恒族原本对阿里瑟姆深信不疑

00:52.540 --> 00:55.000
直到永恒族至尊艾贾克

00:55.170 --> 00:57.670
所领导的一项任务改变了一切

「在我们广阔的地球上
"In this broad Earth of ours,

08:08.180 --> 08:11.520
在无数的污秽与火山渣之间
"Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,

08:11.690 --> 08:14.900
安定尘封于地心之中
"Enclosed and safe within its central heart,

08:15.060 --> 08:17.650
完美的种子静静窝藏」
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

08:18.480 --> 08:21.400
这位诗人对人性的希望和乐观
The poet's hope and optimism in humanity

08:21.570 --> 08:26.030

谢谢惠特曼先生 抱歉我迟到了
Thank you, Mr. Whitman. Sorry I'm late, everyone.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.550
今天我们要学顶级掠食者
Today, we'll be learning about the importance

08:40.720 --> 08:43.760
在平衡生态系中的重要性
of apex predators in a balanced ecosystem.

08:45.090 --> 08:46.100
念诗
Poetry?

08:46.260 --> 08:49.810
我不知该说什么 这些孩子让我紧张
I completely ran out of things to say, and these kids make me nervous.

08:49.970 --> 08:52.190

Well, I thought you were very charming, Professor.

08:52.770 --> 08:53.810

所以…
So...

09:02.320 --> 09:04.740
谁能告诉我什么是顶级掠食者
who can tell me what an apex predator is?

09:05.200 --> 09:06.910
追捕猎物为食的动物
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.240
非常好
Very good.

09:08.410 --> 09:12.080
顶级掠食者像其他掠食者一样猎食
Apex predators do hunt their prey for food, like all predators.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.120
但它们有一点与众不同
But one thing that sets them apart

09:14.290 --> 09:18.920
栖地中没有其他动物强到能猎杀它们
is that there are no other animals in their habitat strong enough to hunt them.

09:20.170 --> 09:21.510
谁能给我举个例子
Who can give me an example?

09:21.670 --> 09:22.670
狮子
Lions.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.590
狼　-没错
- Wolves. - Correct.

09:27.220 --> 09:28.430
地震
Earthquake.

09:30.930 --> 09:32.850
蹲下…
Get down. Get down!

09:33.020 --> 09:35.850
是地震 蹲在桌子底下
It's an earthquake, everyone. Get down!

09:36.020 --> 09:36.850
躲在桌子底下
Under the tables!

Let me help you. Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

09:48.070 --> 09:49.990

You're all right. You're all right.

我喜欢这首歌
I like this song.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.000

Me, too.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.380
想跳舞吗
Do you wanna dance?

10:43.340 --> 10:44.510
怎么搞的
Wait, what the hell?

10:45.460 --> 10:46.670
你的手
Your hand!

10:47.430 --> 10:51.260
你喝太多了 我该走了
You've had too much to drink. I gotta go.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.240

11:19.120 --> 11:20.670
这是中世纪的吗
Is this from the Middle Ages?

11:20.830 --> 11:22.130
有你的家族徽章
It has your family crest.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.750
一定很贵吧
It must have cost a fortune.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.550
我是网络下标高手
I'm a good eBay bidder.

11:26.710 --> 11:27.720
谢谢
Thank you.

11:28.380 --> 11:29.680
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

11:33.260 --> 11:37.930
所以你有考虑过同居的事吗
So, have you given any more thought to us moving in together?

11:38.100 --> 11:40.270
有 我考虑过了
Yeah, I... I thought about it.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.440
我不能搬去和你住
I can't move in with you.

11:43.610 --> 11:45.440
我也觉得你会这么说
Yeah. Thought you'd say that.

11:45.610 --> 11:46.440
对不起
I'm sorry.

11:46.610 --> 11:49.110
我想我知道为什么
And I think I know why.

11:51.070 --> 11:52.490
你是巫师吗
Are you a wizard?

11:52.990 --> 11:53.990
什么
What?

11:54.160 --> 11:55.950
对 就像奇异博士
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.120
不 我…
No. I'm...

11:57.290 --> 11:59.580
我发现在你身边时会发生不寻常的事
I've noticed some unusual things happen when I'm around you.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.830
例如服务生不理我们 水就变成咖啡
Like our water always turns to coffee whenever the waiter ignores us.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
因为你对咖啡因上瘾了
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

12:04.170 --> 12:06.420
丝派克也会透露口风
And Sprite says things...

12:07.050 --> 12:10.090
像你和前男友在一世纪前分手
...like you and your ex-boyfriend broke up a century ago.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.720
她说的
She said that?

12:11.880 --> 12:13.090
而且他会飞
And he can fly.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.180
他是飞行员
He's a pilot.

12:16.060 --> 12:18.140
去开房间啦
Get a room, you two.

12:18.310 --> 12:20.770
能走了吗 我睡觉时间过了
Can we go now? It's past my bedtime.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.940
你真的恋爱了吗
Are you really in love?

12:27.110 --> 12:28.360
如果是呢
What if I am?

12:28.530 --> 12:30.700
那你最好跟他说实话
You better tell him the truth, then.

12:30.860 --> 12:32.490
我会找机会
I'm working on it.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.500
你们想吃披萨吗
You guys wanna get pizza?

12:45.670 --> 12:46.920
不了 谢谢
No, thank you!

12:48.800 --> 12:52.260
他不会长生不老 和他同居吧
He won't live forever, you know. Move in with him.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.140
我跟你一起住啊
I live with you.

12:56.430 --> 12:57.560
戴恩
Dane.

13:00.390 --> 13:02.140
靠 那是变异族吗
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

13:02.310 --> 13:03.940
戴恩 快跑
Dane, run!

13:15.410 --> 13:16.580
瑟希 　-我们走
Sersi? Let's go.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.660
那是什么东西 　-变异族
What is that thing? A Deviant!

13:20.830 --> 13:22.000
你说你们杀光它们了
You said you killed them all!

13:22.160 --> 13:23.160
你跟他说的
You told him that?

13:23.330 --> 13:24.960
你相信我 　-现在信了
You believed me? I do now!

13:31.670 --> 13:33.220
你想干嘛
What are you doing?

13:33.380 --> 13:34.430
保护戴恩
Keep Dane safe!

13:34.590 --> 13:36.470
瑟希 等等 什么
Sersi, wait! What?

13:44.940 --> 13:46.060
你没事
You're fine, dude.

13:46.230 --> 13:47.360
丝派克
Sprite!

13:52.570 --> 13:54.490
不行 爬楼梯
No. Stairs.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.240
快跑 快…
Run! Go! Go!

14:34.400 --> 14:35.780
快　-快点
- Go! - Come on!

14:43.450 --> 14:44.830
它知道我们在哪
It knows where we are!

14:45.250 --> 14:46.080
怎么会
How?

14:46.250 --> 14:47.750
我不知道
I don't know!

14:49.210 --> 14:50.210
丝派克
Sprite!

14:56.170 --> 14:57.170
丝派克
Sprite!

15:16.360 --> 15:17.450
伊卡利斯
Ikaris!

15:19.070 --> 15:20.530
晚安 两位小姐
Evening, ladies.

15:22.370 --> 15:23.450
小心
Watch out!

15:39.680 --> 15:40.970
巫师
Wizard.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.600
我以为死定了

15:44.760 --> 15:45.850
对不起
Sorry.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.960
它自愈了吗
Did it just heal itself?

16:28.390 --> 16:29.600
伊卡利斯
Ikaris.

16:30.980 --> 16:33.270
好高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

16:33.730 --> 16:35.570
我也很高兴见到你 丝派克
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

16:41.780 --> 16:43.490
我是戴恩
I'm Dane.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.070
你好 戴恩
Hello, Dane.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.790
我猜你就是那个飞行员
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

17:01.340 --> 17:04.510
我们是永恒族 来自奥林匹亚星
We're Eternals, from a planet called Olympia.

17:05.180 --> 17:08.100
七千年前搭多摩号星舰前来
We came here 7,000 years ago on the Domo,

17:08.260 --> 17:11.690
保护人类免于变异族侵害
our starship, to protect humans from the Deviants.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.600
我们以为在五世纪前杀光了它们
We thought we killed them all five centuries ago,

17:14.770 --> 17:16.860
如今它们又回来了
but now they're back.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.400
如果你不想搬来跟我住 可以直说
Look, if you don't want to move in with me, you could just say.

17:21.570 --> 17:23.030
戴恩 我是认真的
Dane, this is serious.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.200
我知道 我还不能接受你不是巫师
Oh, I know. I'm just still getting over the fact you're not a wizard.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.370
本来希望你能把我变成长颈鹿
I was hoping you could change me into a giraffe.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.040
小时候我想当长颈鹿
I always wanted to be a giraffe when I was a kid.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.500
可惜我不能改变有感情的动物
It's too bad I can't change sentient beings.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.000
你会是很可爱的长颈鹿
You would have made a very cute giraffe.

17:39.170 --> 17:41.210
你们怎么不帮忙对抗萨诺斯
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

17:41.510 --> 17:44.590
阻止战争 或史上其他可怕的事
Or any war? Or all the other terrible things throughout history?

17:45.090 --> 17:47.340
我们接获指示 不能介入人类冲突
We were instructed not to interfere in any human conflicts

17:47.510 --> 17:48.560
除非有变异族出现
unless Deviants were involved.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.930
为什么
Why?

17:50.100 --> 17:55.270
如果七千年来我们一直保护人类
If we'd protected humanity from everything for 7,000 years,

17:55.440 --> 17:59.320
你们永远没机会以自己的方式发展
you'd never have had the chance to develop in the way you were meant to.

17:59.480 --> 18:03.700
如果变异族很久以前就消灭了
But if the Deviants were eradicated a long time ago,

18:03.860 --> 18:05.200
你们为何还在这里
why are you still here?

18:05.360 --> 18:06.450
我们一直在等待
We've been waiting...

18:06.910 --> 18:08.950
可以回家的通知
to be told we can go home.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.000
所以…
So...

18:12.830 --> 18:14.040
伊卡利斯
Ikaris.

18:14.870 --> 18:16.790
飞得离太阳太近的男孩
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

18:17.290 --> 18:19.630
我们住雅典时 丝派克编了这故事
Sprite made that story up when we lived in Athens.

18:19.790 --> 18:22.090
公元前5世纪
In the fifth century BC?

18:22.250 --> 18:23.920
你们俩在一起多久了
How long were you two together?

18:24.090 --> 18:25.590
五千年
5,000 years.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.970
那算长期交往了
I guess you can call that long-term.

18:30.140 --> 18:31.470
发生了什么事
What happened?

18:31.850 --> 18:33.560
他离开了
He left.

18:34.020 --> 18:37.310
我一直以为他会回来 可是…
I always thought he'd come back, but...

18:37.810 --> 18:39.560
从来没有
he never did.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.520
所以我放下了
So, I moved on.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.360
很高兴你放下了
I'm glad you did.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.400
对不起
I'm sorry.

18:46.910 --> 18:48.320
我该走了
I have to go.

18:57.540 --> 19:00.000
今天早上 一场史无前例的全球地震
This morning, an unprecedented global earthquake

19:00.170 --> 19:01.750
席卷世界各国
swept nation-states across the world,

19:01.920 --> 19:03.960
造成损害和恐慌
causing damage and panic.

19:04.130 --> 19:06.720
许多人猜测它与弹指事件有关
Many have speculated its connection with the Blip.

19:07.170 --> 19:09.140
联合国呼吁召开紧急会议…
The UN has called for an emergency meeting...

19:09.300 --> 19:11.430
那个变异族有办法自愈
That Deviant healed itself.

19:12.430 --> 19:14.470
它们以前根本做不到
They could never do that before.

19:16.230 --> 19:19.650
它不找人类却冲着我们来 怎么了
And it was coming after us instead of humans. What's going on?

19:19.810 --> 19:22.520
我是因为地震才来看你们
I came to check on you because of the earthquake.

19:22.690 --> 19:24.780
没听说过那个变异族
That Deviant is news to me.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.610
地球出事了
Something's happening to Earth.

19:30.910 --> 19:32.700
这不可能是巧合
Can't be a coincidence.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.950
我们需要找到其他族人
We need to find the others.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.540
有些人几百年没见了
I haven't seen some of them for centuries.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.630
应该没多大变化
I doubt much has changed.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.640
抱歉我伤害了你 瑟希
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.150
但我们需要团结
But we need to stick together.

20:02.650 --> 20:04.610
只要确定你安全 我就不烦你
And once I know you're safe, I'll leave you alone.

20:05.820 --> 20:07.900
我们先去找艾贾克
Let's go to Ajak first.

20:08.860 --> 20:10.780
她知道该怎么做
She'll know what to do.

20:14.620 --> 20:16.330
听到了吗 丝派克
You hear that, Sprite?

20:17.080 --> 20:19.000
家人团圆
Family reunion.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.870
也该是时候了
It's about time.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.260
那个是我的 算了
Hey, that one was mine! Oh, never mind.

20:44.350 --> 20:45.570
不要害怕
Do not fear.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.820
快到大门里面
Quickly, inside the gate!

21:40.160 --> 21:44.920
（公元前575年 巴比伦）

22:10.480 --> 22:11.610
艾贾克
Ajak.

22:12.690 --> 22:13.780
阿里瑟姆
Arishem.

22:14.650 --> 22:17.820
我们继续保护巴比伦不受变异族侵害
We continue to keep Babylon safe from the Deviants.

22:17.990 --> 22:20.490
越来越多的人前来寻求庇护
More people have come to seek refuge.

22:20.660 --> 22:23.410
它现在是地球上最大的城市
It is now the largest city on Earth.

22:23.580 --> 22:26.420
在各银河系执行任务的永恒族
The Eternals serving their missions across the galaxies

22:26.580 --> 22:28.290
将以你们的成功为榜样
will learn from your success.

22:28.710 --> 22:29.840
谢谢
Thank you.

22:32.880 --> 22:36.090
我尊重你的宏伟计划 阿里瑟姆
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

22:37.180 --> 22:40.890
但我注意到这个星球的特别之处
But I have noticed something special about this planet.

22:43.020 --> 22:46.310
我担心或许这一次的代价…
And I fear that maybe this time the cost may...

22:46.480 --> 22:49.190
不要对这个星球动感情
Do not become attached to this planet.

22:49.360 --> 22:53.190
你必须专注于任务真正的使命
You must focus on the true purpose of your mission.

22:54.610 --> 22:56.110
我明白
I understand.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.200
我不会让你失望
I will not let you down.

23:23.890 --> 23:24.930
费斯托斯
Phastos.

23:25.100 --> 23:28.020
昨晚有没有听我的话去跑趴
Did you go to the party last night like I told you to?

23:28.190 --> 23:29.190
跑趴 有
The party, yeah.

23:29.350 --> 23:30.860
他熬夜工作
- Yeah, it was... - He worked all night.

23:31.270 --> 23:32.270
谁在跟你说话
Who was talking to you?

23:32.440 --> 23:34.610
要有自己的生活 瑟希呢
Get a life. And where is Sersi?

23:34.780 --> 23:35.780
照常迟到
Late as usual.

23:35.940 --> 23:38.950
抱歉 我有令人兴奋的东西给你看
I'm sorry, but I have something very exciting to show you, okay?

23:39.990 --> 23:41.820
等著瞧
Wait till you see this.

23:45.620 --> 23:46.620
它是什么
What is it?

23:46.790 --> 23:48.330
一具引擎
It's an engine.

23:48.500 --> 23:51.540
它将蒸汽从高压转移到低压
It moves steam from high pressure to low pressure.

23:52.170 --> 23:54.750
帮助他们以超高速耕田
Uh, it'll help them till their fields at an incredibly fast rate.

23:55.130 --> 23:56.300
会吓坏他们
It's gonna freak them out.

23:56.710 --> 23:59.300
他们发明轮子才一千年
I mean, they only have had the wheel 1,000 years, so...

24:00.550 --> 24:04.390
我们可以用你的意念控制他们
You know, we could do that thing where you use your mind to control them

24:04.560 --> 24:05.560
他们就能进步得更快
and then they could do it quicker.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.980
艾贾克 你有在听吗
Ajak, you listening to this?

24:07.140 --> 24:09.980
费斯托斯 这蒸汽…
Phastos, this steam...

24:10.140 --> 24:12.150
引擎 是蒸汽引擎　-太早了
Engine. It's a steam engine. It's too soon.

24:12.730 --> 24:13.730
她来了
And there she is.

24:14.150 --> 24:15.610
我错过什么
What did I miss?

24:15.860 --> 24:19.820
没什么 只有我大失所望的尖叫声
Nothing. Just the screams of my deep disappointment.

24:19.990 --> 24:21.910
我相信你有更简单的东西
I am sure you have something simpler.

24:22.070 --> 24:22.910
简单
Simple.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.660
好吧 我看看
Okay, let's see. Uh...

24:25.990 --> 24:28.960
各位先生女士 向你们介绍
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you

24:30.290 --> 24:31.620
犁
the plow.

24:32.630 --> 24:34.590
那就是它的功用
'Cause that's what it does.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.050
犁土
Plows dirt.

24:36.210 --> 24:39.470
我遇到一群移居者在北部田野盖住家
I met another group of settlers who are building their homes in the northern fields.

24:39.630 --> 24:41.010
他们会需要种自己的作物
They'll need to plant their own crops.

24:41.550 --> 24:43.140
谢谢你 瑟希　-听我说
- Thanks, Sersi. - Listen,

24:43.720 --> 24:47.180
人类比我们有些人希望的发展更慢
humanity may be coming along slower than some of us want.

24:48.140 --> 24:52.900
或许他们在进步过程中会发现奇迹
But there is no telling what wonders they will discover as they advance.

24:54.230 --> 24:59.490
世界的奇迹等着你
The wonders of the world await you.

25:00.530 --> 25:03.740
跟随吉尔伽美什与恩奇都加入战争
Follow Gilgamesh and Enkidu into battle.

25:03.910 --> 25:08.120
永远受他们的勇敢和力量所鼓舞
Be forever inspired by their bravery and strength.

25:08.290 --> 25:11.750
你和你的同胞…
You and your fellow man...

25:11.910 --> 25:14.790
将踏上伟大的冒险之旅
...will go on great adventures.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.050
成为你们自己的传奇
And become legends of your own!

25:23.050 --> 25:24.050
我看到了
I just saw that.

25:24.220 --> 25:26.100
明明还有很多椅子
There's so many other chairs, man.

25:26.260 --> 25:27.430
我能用我的能力…
You know, I could use my powers...

25:27.600 --> 25:29.180
过来陪我喝一杯
Come and have a drink with me.

25:29.640 --> 25:30.640
不了
No.

25:30.810 --> 25:32.560
我不能让你独自对抗变异族
I can't let you go and fight Deviants on your own.

25:32.730 --> 25:34.900
我们需要守护这座城市　-让开
We need to guard the city. Get out of my way.

25:35.650 --> 25:38.520
我来这个星球不是为了缩在墙后
I didn't come to this planet to cower behind walls.

25:39.030 --> 25:42.450
我们得相信阿里瑟姆对这星球的安排
We need to trust Arishem's design for this planet.

25:44.910 --> 25:45.870
圣娜
Thena.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.700
与你并肩作战是我的荣幸
It's an honor to fight alongside you.

25:52.330 --> 25:53.580
我也一样
And you.

25:57.130 --> 26:00.170
美丽的玛卡瑞 你迟到了
My beautiful Makkari. You're late.

26:00.420 --> 26:04.720
我要有足够的工艺品才能换到好东西
I needed to get enough artifacts to make a good trade.

26:09.010 --> 26:10.430
骗她就好了
Just lie to her.

26:15.270 --> 26:19.400
我能感觉到振动
I can sense vibrations. I can sense vibrations.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.280
即使是最微小的动作
Even the tiniest movement.

26:21.730 --> 26:26.070
包括你们说话的声音
Including your voices when you speak.

26:26.570 --> 26:30.160
你们俩在浪费我的时间吗
Did you two just waste my time?

26:30.540 --> 26:33.200
你正在寻找的《翠玉录》
The Emerald Tablet you're searching for...

26:33.370 --> 26:34.370
是个谜
...is a myth!

26:49.720 --> 26:51.390
当人类发生冲突时
When humans have conflict,

26:51.560 --> 26:54.930
艾贾克告诉我们不要干涉
Ajak tells us not to interfere.

26:55.100 --> 26:59.150
她还说偷窃非常非常糟糕
Well, she also says that stealing is very, very bad.

27:03.030 --> 27:03.900
如果你不说
If you don't tell,

27:04.070 --> 27:05.530
我也不会说
I won't tell.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.360
一言为定
Deal.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.920
我保证不让我对瑟希的感情影响任务
I promise I won't let my feelings for Sersi distract me from my mission.

27:22.090 --> 27:25.260
人类无力保护自己免受变异族侵害
Humans are far from being able to protect themselves from the Deviants.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.340
我们还有很多事要做
We still have much to do.

27:29.010 --> 27:31.010
你对阿里瑟姆的信心很坚定
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.100
我感觉得到
I can feel it.

27:34.850 --> 27:37.310
但你也能过自己的生活 知道吗
But you are allowed to live a life, you know?

27:38.020 --> 27:40.350
告诉瑟希你的感受
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

28:06.550 --> 28:07.760
试试看
Try.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.390
对不起 我搞砸了
Sorry. I'm making a mess.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.020
嗯 还不错
Well, not bad.

28:19.730 --> 28:20.690
再见
See you.

28:21.810 --> 28:23.150
我来帮你
Let me help you.

28:50.130 --> 28:51.300
它和你的眼睛很搭
It matches your eyes.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.100
你真好心
You are very kind.

28:54.260 --> 28:56.180
你在学他们的语言了
You're learning their language now?

28:56.350 --> 28:58.470
如果我想花更多时间陪你
If I want to spend more time with you,

28:58.640 --> 29:00.600
就需要了解他们
I need to get to know them.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.940
我非常漂亮
I am very beautiful.

29:06.980 --> 29:07.980
等等 我说了什么
Wait, what did I say?

29:08.150 --> 29:11.360
你说「我非常漂亮」
You said, "I am very beautiful."

29:14.530 --> 29:15.580
你…
You...

29:18.370 --> 29:21.080
你非常漂亮 瑟希
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

29:33.010 --> 29:34.550
我是你的 瑟希
I'm yours, Sersi,

29:35.720 --> 29:36.720
只要你愿意接受我
if you'll have me.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.270
我爱你 伊卡利斯
I love you, Ikaris.

30:26.060 --> 30:27.690
我爱你 瑟希
I love you, Sersi.

30:38.580 --> 30:42.450
（公元400年 笈多帝国）

30:47.380 --> 30:51.050
愿诸神在此见证你们结为连理
May the gods hereby bond you in matrimony.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.300
恭喜
Congratulations.

31:20.410 --> 31:25.200
（今日 南达科他州）

31:35.130 --> 31:36.420
有人在吗
Hello?

31:40.090 --> 31:41.260
艾贾克
Ajak?

32:06.040 --> 32:07.660
艾贾克
Ajak!

32:33.610 --> 32:35.270
是变异族干的
It was a Deviant.

32:42.700 --> 32:45.120
我们的爱
Our love

32:45.280 --> 32:48.620
还有我们的忠诚
And our devotion

32:49.290 --> 32:54.290
如海洋一样深
Were as deep as any ocean

32:59.220 --> 33:01.300
那是我最后一次见到她
It was the last time I saw her.

33:03.180 --> 33:07.350
艾贾克请我看看瑟希 所以我去伦敦
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi, so I went to London.

33:09.560 --> 33:12.980
原来我们俩都很寂寞 需要彼此
Turned out, both of us were lonely and we needed each other.

33:14.770 --> 33:16.820
我想艾贾克一直…
I guess, in her way,

33:16.980 --> 33:19.990
用她的方式照顾着我们
Ajak never stopped trying to take care of us.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.910
再见 艾贾克
Bye, Ajak.

33:34.500 --> 33:37.000
这是我们七千年来第一次有人死亡
It's the first time in 7,000 years one of us has died.

33:37.550 --> 33:40.090
我想在伦敦攻击我们的那个变异族
I think the Deviant that attacked us in London

33:40.260 --> 33:42.050
杀死了艾贾克 并吸取她的力量
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.930
变异族从未这么做过
Deviants have never done that in the past.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.140
它就像艾贾克一样自愈
It healed itself just like Ajak.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.220
我发誓 我几乎听到它说话
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.080
阿里瑟姆
- Arishem.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.210
瑟希
- Sersi.

34:18.380 --> 34:20.010
时间差不多了
It is almost time.

34:21.880 --> 34:24.090
瑟希…你还好吗
Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?

34:24.680 --> 34:26.140
怎么了 瑟希
What happened, Sersi?

34:29.350 --> 34:31.770
艾贾克用来和阿里瑟姆交谈的球
The sphere that Ajak used to talk with Arishem,

34:31.930 --> 34:34.440
从她的身体飘出来 进入我体内
it came out of her body and went inside me.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.310
你和阿里瑟姆谈过
Did you talk with Arishem?

34:36.940 --> 34:38.570
对 他说…
Yes. He said

34:39.150 --> 34:40.900
时间差不多了
it's almost time.

34:42.150 --> 34:43.860
你能设法再跟他说话吗
Can you try talking to him again?

34:44.820 --> 34:46.240
我不知道怎么做
I don't know how.

34:46.410 --> 34:48.280
但她选择了你来接替她
But she chose you to replace her.

34:48.950 --> 34:50.200
她给了你那颗球
And she gave you the sphere.

34:50.370 --> 34:51.450
等等 丝派克
Hold on, Sprite.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.580
你确定你和阿里瑟姆谈过
Are you sure you talked with Arishem?

34:54.750 --> 34:56.040
不然会是什么
What else would it be?

34:57.290 --> 34:58.540
永魔症
Mahd Wy'ry.

35:04.880 --> 35:09.680
（1521年 特诺奇蒂特兰）

35:34.830 --> 35:36.080
其他人在哪里
Where are the others?

35:37.210 --> 35:39.250
我们不得不分开
We had to split up.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.500
变异族比你说的还多
There were more Deviants than you said.

35:41.670 --> 35:43.340
相信你们玩得很尽兴
Well, I'm sure that was a lot of fun for you.

35:43.670 --> 35:44.880
没错
It was.

35:47.050 --> 35:49.140
等其他人杀死最后的变异族
Once the others kill these last Deviants,

35:49.890 --> 35:52.140
就把它们从这星球上彻底歼灭了
we will have eliminated them all from the planet.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.570
不要
Don't.

36:12.910 --> 36:15.370
我们不干涉他们的战争
We don't interfere in their wars.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.040
这不是战争
This isn't war.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.000
是种族灭绝
It's genocide.

36:20.370 --> 36:22.420
他们的武器变得太致命了
Their weapons have become too deadly.

36:23.800 --> 36:26.970
帮他们进步并非好主意 费斯托斯
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea helping them advance, Phastos.

36:27.170 --> 36:30.720
科技是他们演化过程的一部分 诸克
Technology is a part of their evolutionary process, Druig.

36:30.890 --> 36:32.430
那不是我能阻止的
It's not exactly something that I can stop.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.600
对 你不能 但我可以
No, you can't. But I can.

36:34.930 --> 36:36.270
坚强点
Stay strong.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.350
太迟了
It's too late.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.980
圣娜 　-每个人都会死
Thena? Everyone is going to die.

36:42.110 --> 36:43.110
你还好吗
Are you okay?

36:44.520 --> 36:45.520
圣娜
Thena?

36:48.780 --> 36:50.610
圣娜…不　-圣娜
Thena? Thena, no! Thena!

37:19.810 --> 37:22.150
不要听你脑中的指示 圣娜
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

37:23.150 --> 37:25.110
听我的声音
Listen to my voice.

37:26.820 --> 37:28.480
你很安全
You are safe.

37:29.610 --> 37:32.200
你感受到爱
You are loved.

37:33.110 --> 37:34.910
你是我们的圣娜
You're our Thena.

37:42.210 --> 37:43.370
圣娜
Hey, Thena!

37:43.540 --> 37:45.790
住手…
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

38:04.100 --> 38:05.690
她还好吗 　-嗯
- Is she okay? - Yeah.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.110
瑟希
Sersi.

38:08.270 --> 38:09.280
圣娜 求求你
Thena, please.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.360
回到我们身边
Come back to us.

38:12.030 --> 38:13.070
好
Okay.

38:29.630 --> 38:31.760
我以为永魔症是没根据的说法
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

38:35.180 --> 38:36.850
无药可救
There is no cure...

38:37.720 --> 38:39.180
所以没人真的去谈它
so no one really talks about it.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.020
发生了什么事
What happened?

38:45.190 --> 38:46.270
圣娜
Thena.

38:46.440 --> 38:47.980
你攻击所有人
You attacked everyone.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.780
你打伤瑟希、费斯托斯
Wounded Sersi, Phastos,

38:50.940 --> 38:52.900
差点杀死玛卡瑞
you nearly killed Makkari.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.200
我不记得了
I don't remember.

38:57.360 --> 38:59.450
你得了永魔症
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

38:59.620 --> 39:03.790
你的意念因记忆的重压逐渐瓦解
Your mind is fracturing under the weight of your memories.

39:03.960 --> 39:08.210

我必须通知阿里瑟姆 带你回舰上
I will have to inform Arishem and take you back to the ship

39:12.760 --> 39:15.590
那里有科技能帮你

但她就不再是圣娜了
But she won't be Thena anymore.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.140
如果再发生呢 她差点杀了你
What if it happens again? She could've killed you.

39:20.310 --> 39:21.810
差点杀了我们所有人
She could have killed all of us.

39:21.970 --> 39:22.970

39:24.640 --> 39:27.150

39:38.280 --> 39:40.030
你的精神会留存下来

39:40.200 --> 39:42.990
内心深处永远都是圣娜

39:43.450 --> 39:44.450
相信我

39:44.620 --> 39:45.870
她凭什么相信你
Why should she trust you?

39:47.670 --> 39:50.290
你要她让你清除她的身份
You're asking her to let you erase who she is.

39:50.460 --> 39:52.300
诸克 我知道你很不满 但是…
Druig, I know you're upset, but...

39:52.460 --> 39:53.500

我们相信你七千年 看看我们的处境

40:00.220 --> 40:02.970
我目睹人类互相残杀
I've watched humans destroy each other

40:03.140 --> 40:05.220
而我明明能出手阻止
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

40:07.020 --> 40:09.770
知道千百年后这对一个人的影响吗
Do you know what that does to someone after centuries?

40:11.060 --> 40:13.150
我们的任务会不会是一个错误
Could our mission have been a mistake?

40:13.940 --> 40:17.150
我们真在帮这些人建立更好的世界
Are we really helping these people build a better world, huh?

40:26.200 --> 40:28.580
我们跟底下的士兵没两样
We're just like the soldiers down there.

40:29.420 --> 40:31.580
不过是他们领袖的棋子
Pawns to their leaders.

40:32.250 --> 40:34.340
被忠诚所蒙蔽
Blinded by loyalty.

40:37.380 --> 40:39.090
现在结束了
It ends now.

40:56.860 --> 40:57.860

You're gonna have to make me.

40:59.530 --> 41:00.530

Stop.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.620
如果你想阻止我
If you wanna stop me,

41:09.910 --> 41:11.790
就得杀了我
you're gonna have to kill me.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.360
我会照顾圣娜
I'll watch over Thena.

41:38.070 --> 41:39.150
让她保留她的记忆

41:40.400 --> 41:42.450
有一天当她攻击你
One day, when she attacks you,

41:43.070 --> 41:45.120
你可能必须杀了她

41:51.250 --> 41:53.000
我们愿意冒险
We'll take that chance.

42:02.800 --> 42:03.970
你们都可以走了

42:06.430 --> 42:08.140
变异族消失了
The Deviants are gone.

42:09.020 --> 42:11.980
你们没必要待在我身边
There is no reason for you to stay with me.

42:12.140 --> 42:13.730
你不该先问问阿里瑟姆吗
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

42:13.900 --> 42:15.730
我们是一个团队 应该待在一起
We're a team, we should stay together.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.820
我没有问你的意见 伊卡利斯
I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris.

42:18.980 --> 42:21.320
不要忘记你的身份

42:24.530 --> 42:26.780
我们就在这里道别吧

42:27.910 --> 42:29.490

42:33.210 --> 42:35.960
为自己而活
And live a life for yourselves.

42:36.130 --> 42:37.880
不是以军人的身份
Not as soldiers.

42:38.590 --> 42:41.550
不是为了原本的使命
Not with the purpose you were given.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.720
去寻找自己的目标

42:45.590 --> 42:49.760
有一天 当我们再次聚首

现在接近她得小心
She's no fun to be around right now.

51:47.550 --> 51:49.050
圣娜
Hey, Thena.

51:49.470 --> 51:51.350
你看谁来了
Look who's here.

51:52.220 --> 51:53.390
把你的手给我
Give me your hand.

51:56.140 --> 51:57.190
圣娜
Thena.

51:57.600 --> 52:00.360
仙图里六的每个人都会死
Everyone in Centuri-6 is going to die.

52:01.070 --> 52:02.110
把你的手给我
Give me your hand.

52:02.270 --> 52:04.490
太迟了 我们救不了他们
It's too late. We can't save them.

52:04.650 --> 52:05.530
圣娜
Thena.

52:12.580 --> 52:13.830
圣娜
Thena.

52:14.540 --> 52:17.250
我们一起搭星舰来到地球
We came to Earth together on our ship.

52:19.540 --> 52:21.250
你是永恒族
You're an Eternal.

52:22.090 --> 52:24.840
奥林匹亚星最伟大的战士
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

52:25.010 --> 52:27.090
传奇的雅典保护者
The legendary protector of Athens.

52:28.590 --> 52:30.510
女战神
The goddess of war.

52:32.510 --> 52:34.850
记住你的身份
Remember who you are.

52:42.900 --> 52:44.360
记住
Remember.

53:00.250 --> 53:02.210
圣娜　-你好
Thena. Hi.

53:03.170 --> 53:04.170
哈啰
Hello.

53:04.550 --> 53:06.510
你的园丁是谁
Hey, who's your gardener?

53:08.010 --> 53:10.220
这就是你们每天吃的东西
This is just what you guys eat every day?

53:10.380 --> 53:11.970
对 太棒了　-每天
Yeah, this is amazing. Every day.

53:12.140 --> 53:14.220
谢谢你的招待　-不客气
Thank you for this. Oh, you're welcome.

53:14.390 --> 53:15.560
自己动手
Help yourself.

53:15.720 --> 53:18.890
这是葡萄酒、啤酒和蜂蜜酒混成的
This one is a trio of wine, beer, and mead.

53:19.060 --> 53:21.520
为特洛伊战争的士兵调制的
Made for all the soldiers in the battle of Troy.

53:22.190 --> 53:23.770
真是太周到了
That's so thoughtful.

53:30.570 --> 53:32.160
她该喝酒吗
Should she be drinking?

53:33.410 --> 53:36.830
不 她的不含酒精 小孩喝的
No, hers is non-alcoholic. For kids.

53:38.910 --> 53:41.080
我给了你一样的 丝派克
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

53:43.710 --> 53:44.710
小孩喝的
For kids.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.260
我开玩笑的
I was just kidding.

53:48.420 --> 53:51.800
你喝的是奥丁教我的密酿
Yours is a secret brew Odin taught me as a thank-you

53:51.970 --> 53:55.100
感谢我们在滕斯贝格击败劳菲的军队
after we helped defeat Laufey's army in Tonsberg.

53:55.260 --> 53:56.350
什么
What?

53:56.510 --> 53:57.510
（吉尔伽美湿）

53:57.680 --> 53:58.680
我是个大宝宝
I'm a big baby.

53:58.850 --> 54:00.730
真不幼稚 可以停了吗
Very mature. Can you stop?

54:01.600 --> 54:02.940
别闹了　-说到奥丁
- Stop. - Speaking of Odin...

54:03.100 --> 54:05.690
索尔小时候常跟在我屁股后面
Thor used to follow me around when he was a little kid.

54:05.860 --> 54:08.480
现在他是知名的复仇者 不回我电话
Now he's a famous Avenger and won't return my calls.

54:08.650 --> 54:10.990
既然罗杰斯队长和钢铁人都走了
So, now that Captain Rogers and Iron Man are both gone,

54:11.150 --> 54:13.110
你想谁能带领复仇者联盟
who do you think is gonna lead the Avengers?

54:13.780 --> 54:15.280
我可以带领他们
I could lead them.

54:15.450 --> 54:16.660
我认为我会很出色
I figure I'd be good at that.

54:16.830 --> 54:17.660
对 你会
Yeah, you would.

54:17.990 --> 54:20.040
艾贾克竟然没选你来领导我们
Ajak didn't even choose you to lead us.

54:20.790 --> 54:22.620
吉尔 唉唷
Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

54:22.790 --> 54:23.790
好狠哦　-我当你没说
Harsh. I'm gonna let that one slide

54:23.960 --> 54:26.500
你一向受不了我能飞 而你不能
because, you know, you've always been bitter that I can fly and you can't.

54:26.670 --> 54:27.880
你能飞又怎样
Oh, so what, you can fly.

54:28.050 --> 54:29.760
大家都知道我长得比较好看
I'm better-looking, everybody knows that.

54:29.920 --> 54:30.920
你去哪
Where you going?

54:32.930 --> 54:34.590
出去透透气
I'm just gonna get some air.

54:40.470 --> 54:41.850
真的很好喝 吉尔
Mmm. This is really good, Gil.

54:42.020 --> 54:45.230
我能拿来卖 把我的脸放上面当卖点
You know, I could sell this. Put my face on it, move some units.

54:45.400 --> 54:46.690
我用玉米做的
I made it from corn.

54:46.860 --> 54:50.690
我亲自咀嚼玉米粒 再用口水发酵
I chew each kernel myself and ferment it in my spit.

55:04.750 --> 55:07.590
这就是圣娜说的仙图里六吗
Is this the Centuri-6 Thena was talking about?

55:07.920 --> 55:09.710
对 它是一颗星球
Yeah, it's a planet.

55:10.630 --> 55:14.260
她认为她住过那里 直到它被摧毁
She thinks she used to live there until it was destroyed.

55:14.420 --> 55:18.100
常谈到瓦解它的那些超大震动
Always talks about massive quakes ripping it apart.

55:18.260 --> 55:20.180
每个人都死了 包括她自己
Everyone died, including herself.

55:20.600 --> 55:23.270
三天前发生了史无前例的全球大地震
We had an unprecedented global earthquake three days ago.

55:23.940 --> 55:25.770
原来如此
Oh, that's what that was.

55:25.940 --> 55:27.690
我以为我喝醉了
I thought I was drunk.

55:28.400 --> 55:30.610
艾贾克选择我来领导我们 但是…
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

55:31.360 --> 55:33.900
我根本不懂如何和阿里瑟姆对谈
I can't even figure out how to speak to Arishem.

55:34.070 --> 55:35.950
我试过好多次
I've tried so many times.

55:37.160 --> 55:39.240
也许你试得太用力了
Maybe you're trying too hard.

55:40.200 --> 55:42.790
有时你只需要倾听
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

56:30.250 --> 56:31.380
瑟希
Sersi.

56:32.250 --> 56:33.340
阿里瑟姆
Arishem.

56:33.920 --> 56:35.800
艾贾克被一个变异族杀害
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

56:35.970 --> 56:38.380
我们认为它吸取了她的力量
We think it absorbed her power.

56:38.550 --> 56:41.300
地球发生了一件不寻常的事
And something unusual is happening to Earth.

56:41.470 --> 56:44.470
这是神现的副作用
It is a side effect of the emergence.

56:45.890 --> 56:47.520
神现
The emergence?

56:48.270 --> 56:52.440
是该让你了解任务的真正目的了
It is time for you to learn the true purpose of your mission.

56:52.610 --> 56:57.950
你们被派到地球是为催生天神蒂亚穆
You were sent to Earth to bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

56:59.160 --> 57:03.830
每十亿年 新的天神族必须诞生
Every billion years, new Celestials must be born.

57:04.410 --> 57:06.040
我将天神族种子
I plant Celestial seeds into host planets

57:06.200 --> 57:08.920
散播于宇宙各创决星球
across the universe.

57:11.040 --> 57:14.920
地球被选来创决天神蒂亚穆
The planet Earth was chosen to host the Celestial Tiamut.

57:20.300 --> 57:21.930
为了成长
In order to grow,

57:22.100 --> 57:25.930
蒂亚穆需要大量来自智慧生命的能量
Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy from intelligent life.

57:26.930 --> 57:30.440
变异族食用人类 阻碍了这一点
The Deviants prevented this by consuming humans

57:30.600 --> 57:33.270
直到永恒族消灭它们
until the Eternals eliminated them.

57:33.900 --> 57:39.820
如今这个星球的人口已达到所需数量
Now, the human population of this planet has reached the required amount.

57:39.990 --> 57:43.030
该是神现开始的时候了
It is time for the emergence to begin.

58:03.010 --> 58:04.100
可是…
But...

58:05.390 --> 58:07.140
地球上的每个人都会死
everyone on Earth will die.

58:08.810 --> 58:11.890
瑟希 一个生命的终结
The end of one life, Sersi,

58:13.270 --> 58:16.070
是另一个生命的开端
is the beginning of another.

58:28.910 --> 58:32.790
我们的宇宙就是不断的能量交换
Our universe is a constant exchange of energy.

58:33.790 --> 58:37.840
创造与毁灭的无限循环
An infinite cycle of creation and destruction.

58:38.760 --> 58:41.010
天神族运用
Celestials use energy

58:41.170 --> 58:44.260
创决星球聚集的能量来创造太阳
gathered from host planets to create suns,

58:44.930 --> 58:48.180
产生重力、热和光
generating gravity, heat, and light

58:48.350 --> 58:50.850
以形成新的银河系
for new galaxies to form.

58:55.860 --> 58:57.480
没有我们
Without us,

58:57.650 --> 59:00.820
我们的宇宙将陷入黑暗
our universe will fall into darkness.

59:03.570 --> 59:05.450
所有生命都会死去
All life will die.

59:06.660 --> 59:08.410
艾贾克知道真相吗
Ajak knew the truth?

59:08.830 --> 59:13.710
数百万年来 她协助许多天神族出现
She has helped many Celestials to emerge over millions of years.

59:13.870 --> 59:15.580
你也是
So have you.

59:16.420 --> 59:20.300
但地球是我的第一次任务
Earth was my first mission.

59:21.710 --> 59:25.430
我原本在家乡 奥林匹亚星
I was home, on Olympia.

59:26.800 --> 59:29.220
根本没有奥林匹亚星
There is no Olympia.

59:47.320 --> 59:50.370
这才是你真正的家乡 瑟希
This is your true home, Sersi.

59:51.410 --> 59:53.120
世界熔炉
The World Forge.

59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.210
我在这里创造并设计了永恒族
It is here that I built and programmed the Eternals.

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:38.210
除了我们 一切都会死去
Everything dies except us

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.550
因为我们从未活过
because we were never alive.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.550
我怎么一点都不记得
Why don't I remember any of this?

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.610
你的记忆在每次神现后会清除与重置
Because your memories are erased and reset after each emergence.

01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:05.280
它们储存在这里
They are stored here.

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:09.620
你为何保留它们
Why do you keep them?

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.700
我保留它们是为了研究变异族
I keep them in order to study the Deviants.

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:17.410
我创造了变异族 瑟希
I created the Deviants, Sersi,

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.500
目的跟我创造你们是一样的
for the same purpose I created you.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:25.420
每个天神族创决星球有自己的掠食者
Every Celestial host planet has its own predators.

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:32.300
我最初派变异族去消灭它们
I first sent the Deviants to exterminate them

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:35.010
好让智慧生命可以生长
so intelligent life could grow.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.230
但它们的设计里出现瑕疵
But there was a flaw in their design.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.780
它们逐渐演化
They evolved.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.990
自己变成掠食者
Became predators themselves.

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:52.160
我失去了对它们的控制力
And I lost control of them.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.250
我创造并设计你们 永恒族
I built and programmed you, Eternals,

01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:01.250
成为无法演化的合成体
to be synthetic beings and incapable of evolution,

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.590
以纠正我的错误
to correct my mistake.

01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:10.010
瑟希 艾贾克选择你来接替她
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you to take her place

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:12.430
担任永恒族至尊
as the Prime Eternal.

01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:14.800
不要让我失望
Do not fail me.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.910
你是说我们基本上是酷炫的机器人
So, you're saying we're basically fancy robots?

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.370
我们过去的记忆储存在太空中…
And our past memories are stored somewhere

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.750
某个地方
in space?

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:44.250
阿里瑟姆也创造了变异族
And Arishem made the Deviants.

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:47.840
对不起 圣娜
I'm sorry, Thena.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.420
你曾试图警告我们
You tried to warn us.

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:52.010
上次阿里瑟姆重置你的记忆
The last time Arishem reset your memories,

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:53.590
一定出了差错
something must have gone wrong.

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:55.390
什么意思
What do you mean?

01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:58.890
这不就是永魔症吗
Well, that's what Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.560
圣娜始终记得我们被派往其他星球
All this time, Thena was remembering all the other planets we were sent to

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:04.810
每个人都在神现期间死去
and everyone dying during the emergence.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:06.730
我以为我们是英雄
I thought we were heroes.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.730
原来我们是坏人
Turns out we're the bad guys.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.190
我们不是坏人 好吗
We're not the bad guys, okay?

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.240
我们帮助天神族在宇宙中扩展生命
We've helped the Celestials expand life across the universe.

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:17.580
这不是坏人的作为 好人才这么做
That's not what bad guys do. That's what good guys do.

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.660
每次无辜生命为更大的利益牺牲
Every time innocent lives have been sacrificed for the greater good,

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.870
结果都是错误
it turns out to be a mistake.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.170
我们必须阻止神现
We have to stop the emergence.

01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:28.960
瑟希 我们无权阻止天神族诞生
Sersi, we have no right to stop the birth of a Celestial.

01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:32.010
一定能让蒂亚穆出现又不摧毁地球
There has to be a way Tiamut can emerge without destroying the Earth.

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.300
我们只要让它延后 直到想出办法
We just have to delay it until we figure out how.

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.350
诸克能控制它的意念吗
Could Druig control its mind?

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:41.770
也许让它睡着
Maybe put it to sleep?

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:43.060
让它睡着
"Put it to sleep"?

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.640
你是认真的吗
Are you serious?

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:47.310
吉尔伽美什曾要诸克让我睡着
Gilgamesh asked Druig to put me to sleep once.

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:50.360
所以我能到斐济度假
So I could take a vacation to Fiji, you know?

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.240
我们在讲天神族　-我们必须试试
We're talking about a Celestial, okay? We have to try.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.740
我们不会让地球上所有人死掉吧
Come on, we're not gonna let everyone on Earth die, right?

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:58.240
对
Right.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.080
我是人类 我有点偏心
I'm human. I'm a little biased.

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:05.000
世界末日快来了
The world is ending.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.630
你得回家去
You need to go home.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.960
做什么
And do what?

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:11.210
看电视吗
Watch TV?

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.880
在我能和地球最初的超级英雄
When I could be with the Earth's original superheroes

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:17.470
一起拯救世界时
as they try to save the world?

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.510
好
Fine.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.220
如果你想 就留下
If you want to, stay.

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:24.140
非常谢谢你 先生
Thank you very much, sir.

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:27.060
吉尔伽美什
Gilgamesh,

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:28.770
能请你拿走口水啤酒吗
could you please get rid of the saliva beer?

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.230
我以为你喜欢
I thought you like it, man.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.400
我们该走了 现在
We need to go. Now.

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:34.610
去找其他人
Find the others.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.200
一旦我们聚在一起
Once we're all together,

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.070
就能决定如何处理神现
we'll decide what to do about the emergence.

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:48.420
（亚马逊雨林）

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.900
午安
Good afternoon.

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.610
这里感觉真好 先生
It's very nice here, sir.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.070
不要被耍了
Don't be fooled.

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:19.280
无知就是福
Ignorance is bliss.

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:23.540
嗨 我们在找诸克
Hey. We're looking for Druig.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.660

你怎么认识诸克
How do you know Druig?

我们是朋友
We're friends...

大学认识的
...from college.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:36.460
你好 丝派克

01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:46.180
我想念你们大家
I missed all of you.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:53.060
请 就当自己家
Please, make yourselves at home.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.910
你一口气给了我很多坏消息 小姐
You've given me a lot of bad news in one go, my lady.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.820
你愿意帮我们吗
Will you help us?

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.330
我很高兴…
I am glad that...

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:10.460
（戴恩惠特曼）

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:12.580
你用哪家电信
Hey, what's your service?

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.540
我没讯号
I'm not getting any bars.

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:19.590
还记得这片森林吗 好美
Do you all remember this forest? Beautiful.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.800
我们同住的最后一个地方
It was the last place we all lived together.

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:27.220
我保护这些人20代了
I've protected these people for 20 generations now

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:30.390
不受外界和他们自己侵害
from the outside world and from themselves.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.270
朋友 人类未来要为自己的灭绝负责
Your kind, my friend, you will be responsible for your own extinction one day.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.360
你不觉得吗
Don't you think?

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.990
我们必须从错误中学习 做得更好
I think we must learn from our mistakes and do better, sir.

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:43.030
你不能放弃希望
You must not give up hope.

01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:47.370
不会吧
Oh, no, you didn't.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.040
新规定 不能再附身别人的助理
Okay, new rule, no more possessing people's valets.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.670
你的幽默感哪去了 金勾
Oh, where is your sense of humor, Kingo?

01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:52.830
对不起 先生
I'm sorry, sir.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.210
不要道歉 不是你的错
Don't apologize, it's not your fault.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.590
你不是神 你知道吧
You are not a god. You know that, right?

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.380
真讽刺 金勾 电影明星
How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:04.130
我也导过几部片
I've directed some things, too.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.680
是吗 像什么
Oh, yeah? Like what?

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:07.890
一些网络视频
Some Internet content.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.640
多少次点阅
How many views?

01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:11.730
我不是为了点阅数拍的
I don't do it for the views.

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:13.690
走吧 他在浪费我们时间
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:16.150
我们需要他　-伊卡利斯
- We need him. - Ikaris.

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:18.270
我很想你
I missed you.

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:21.280
你是要迷惑我还是威胁我
Are you gonna charm me or threaten me?

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.490
如果你愿意 有第三种选择
I mean, there's a third option, if you prefer that.

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:26.530
发现你不是妈妈的最爱 一定很难过
It must be heartbreaking to find out that you're not Mother's favorite.

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.370
她一定为你所做的感到骄傲
And I'm sure she'd be real proud of what you've been up to.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:29.540
诸克 这件事很严重
Druig, this is serious.

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.500
我告诉你什么叫严重
I'll tell you what's serious.

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:36.380
原来七千年来我都在执行自杀任务
I've just been told I've been sent on a suicide mission for the past 7,000 years,

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.920
我的存在是一则谎言
and that my entire existence is a lie.

01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:46.430
所以原谅我现在不想鸟你的计划
So, excuse me for not giving a shit about your plan right now.

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:52.730
诸克烂透了
Druig sucks.

01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:54.520
真的 先生
He does, sir.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.750
我不喜欢这个地方
I don't like this place.

01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:20.420
诸克需要思考 瑟希要我们等
Druig needs to think, and Sersi wants us to wait, so...

01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:21.800
我们只好等
we wait.

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:27.510
我在丝派克的幻象中认不出自己
I couldn't recognize myself in Sprite's illusions.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.810
那是美好的往日时光
Those were the good old days.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.230
如果我再也无法战斗了呢
What if I can't fight anymore?

01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:37.940
你当然可以
Of course you can. Mm.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:41.020
要是我又伤害你们呢
What if I hurt you again?

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:46.610
你知道自己是谁 你是女战神圣娜
Come on. You know who you are. You're Thena, goddess of war.

01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:52.870
谢谢
Thank you.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.580
谢什么
For what?

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.670
一直照顾我
For always taking care of me. Oh.

01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:03.760
我会再做一次
I'd do it again.

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:08.550
在任何星球上
On any planet.

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.160
我也喜欢死盯着他
I like watching him, too.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.490
天啊
Jeez.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.240
我觉得一点也不诡异
I don't think it's creepy at all.

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:37.710
你读过《彼得潘》吗
Have you read Peter Pan?

01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:41.000
对我来说 伊卡利斯就是彼得
Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter,

01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:43.290
瑟希是温蒂 你是奇妙仙子
Sersi is Wendy,

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.500
原因显而易见
you are Tinker Bell, for obvious reasons,

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.130
我们其他人则是走失的男孩
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:51.090
你想说什么
What's your point?

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:54.100
奇妙仙子一直爱着彼得
Tinker Bell's always been in love with Peter.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.730
她很难受 因为她不可能和他在一起
And it's hard for her 'cause she can never be with him.

01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:05.150
真遗憾 丝派克
I'm sorry, Sprite.

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:08.320
金勾
Kingo...

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.410
阿里瑟姆为何让我变这模样
why did Arishem make me this way?

01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:16.950
我不知道
I don't know.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.920
我以为你把它弄坏了
I thought you broke it.

01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:27.880
我随身带备用机
Always bring backups.

01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:34.800
先生 你家人很爱气噗噗
You have a very angry family, sir.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.430
这是个大问题
Yeah, it's a big issue.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.520
迈达斯王呢 他碰的东西都会变黄金
What about King Midas? Everything he touched turned to gold.

01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:41.690
那是你吗 　-戴恩
Was that you? Dane.

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:43.770
孔子 亚里士多德 　-打给你叔叔
Confucius? Aristotle? Call your uncle.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.520
什么 我叔叔 不
What? My uncle? No.

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:47.860
你一直想跟他和解吧
You've always wanted to make amends with him, right?

01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:50.400
时候到了 相信我
Now is the time. Trust me.

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:52.160
瑟希 你好奇怪
Sersi, you're so weird.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.570
戴恩 戴恩
Dane? Dane?

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:54.740
（讯号不良）

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.450
你断断续续的
You're breaking up.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.660
你要跟他断了
You're breaking up?

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:03.000
他能接受吗
How did he take the news?

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.000
我无法告诉他世界末日到了
Couldn't bring myself to tell him it was the end of the world.

01:11:06.170 --> 01:11:08.420
他也无能为力
There's nothing he could do.

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:09.590
瑟希
Sersi.

01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:14.680
我很担心你
I'm worried about you.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.640
如果阿里瑟姆发现你试图阻止神现
If Arishem finds out you're trying to stop the emergence...

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.520
我的力量不足以保护你不受他惩罚
I'm not powerful enough to protect you from him.

01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.570
我不怕
I'm not afraid.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.240
这个暴力循环必须划下句点
This violent cycle has to end.

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.580
别再担心我了
Hey, stop worrying about me.

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:43.000
习惯了
Old habit.

01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:52.300
你为什么离开
Why did you leave?

01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:55.220
我告诉自己
I told myself

01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:58.100
你一定出了什么事
something must have happened to you.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.270
所以我开始等
So, I waited.

01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:02.890
好多天变成好多年
Days became years,

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.270
你始终没回来
and you never came back.

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:08.730
瑟希
Sersi,

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.320
我好想你
oh, I've missed you.

01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:15.990
我也不想离开
I didn't want to leave.

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.290
有件事我必须…
There's something I have to tell...

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:22.120
伊卡利斯
Ikaris!

01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:23.960
伊卡利斯

01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:30.040

你还好吗
You're ok?

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:34.630
小心
Watch out!

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.380
撤离营地
Clear the camp!

01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:40.760
躲在我身后
Get behind me!

01:12:40.930 --> 01:12:41.930
有一个带走伊卡利斯
One of them took Ikaris.

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.270
这是偷袭
It's an ambush!

01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:54.240
好棒棒 先生
Very nice, sir!

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:56.110
你起肖了吗 躲起来
Are you mental? Hide!

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.660
我们需要动作场面
We need action sequences.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.490
先生
Sir!

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.870
丝派克 带卡伦离开
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:08.000
年轻人 你带了几台摄像头
How many cameras did you bring, young man?

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.260
金勾
Kingo!

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.840
快走

This way!

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:28.100
快
Quickly! Come on!

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:34.980
进去…
Get in! Get in!

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:13.770
伊卡利斯
Ikaris!

01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:33.170
我跟那个对打过 它比其他的强
I've fought that one before. It's stronger than the others.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.500
不
No.

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:40.880
时机不对 圣娜
Terrible timing, Thena.

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:42.720
圣娜
Thena!

01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:52.480
住手 圣娜
Stop, Thena!

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:29.060
放它们走
Let them go.

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.770

Now is not the time, Sersi.

01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:34.100
拜托 我知道你没这么傻
Please. I know you're better than this.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.490

01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:54.600
你能快点吗
Can you hurry up?

01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:57.650
好了
Now!

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.480
砰
Dishoom.

你怎么做到的
How did you do that?

01:19:30.670 --> 01:19:32.430
我不知道
I don't know.

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.320
停…
Stop, stop, stop.

01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:50.190

01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:09.650
阿里瑟姆利用我们
Arishem used us

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:14.280
每次神现就任我们死去
and left us to die with each emergence.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.070
我们只想活下去
We just wanted to survive.

01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:20.660
然后他派你们来
And then he sent you.

01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:26.120
我会为你们对我族的恶行杀光你们
I will kill you all for what you have done to my kind.

01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:29.080
你们不是救世主 永恒族
You are not saviors, Eternals.

01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:31.290
你们是凶手
You are murderers.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.720
伊卡利斯
Ikaris!

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.310
圣娜
Thena.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.570
嘿
Hey.

01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:00.070
记住
Remember.

01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:09.830
不
No.

01:22:11.710 --> 01:22:13.000
不
No.

01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:17.920
我会记住的
I'll remember.

01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:19.630
我会记住的
I'll remember.

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:44.740
我会记住
I'll remember.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.750
当我离开时
When I left,

01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:34.080
我想过接管这星球上每个人的意念
I thought about taking over the minds of every human on this planet.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.300
暴力、恐惧、贪婪
Violence, fear, greed,

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:40.010
全都没了
all gone.

01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:41.340
为什么没做
Why didn't you?

01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:44.090
因为没有了缺点
Because without their flaws,

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.560
他们就不是人类
they wouldn't be human.

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.560
拜托 诸克 你不能再留在这里
Please, Druig. You can't stay here anymore.

01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:56.770
这些变异族想阻止我们杀死它们同类
These Deviants are trying to keep us from killing their own kind.

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:59.780
它们现在有了良知 因而更危险
They have a conscience now. That makes them more dangerous.

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:01.860
不 瑟希
No, Sersi.

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:05.360
这使它们成了我们
That makes them us.

01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:08.030
永恒族与变异族
Eternals and Deviants.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.870
都是阿里瑟姆的孩子
Arishem's children.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:15.790
但你要我控制一个天神族的意念
But you are asking me to take control of a mind of a Celestial.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.210
我没有那种能力
I do not have that kind of power.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:21.090
我们需要费斯托斯
We'll need Phastos.

01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:25.050
祝你好运
Well, good luck.

01:24:25.890 --> 01:24:28.810
他很久以前就放弃人类了
He gave up on humans a long time ago.

01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:42.440
（1945年8月 广岛）

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:02.760
是我害的
I did this.

01:25:04.670 --> 01:25:07.010
如果我的科技没帮助他们进步…
If my technology hadn't helped them advance...

01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:14.310
诸克说得对
Druig was right.

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:17.270
我们的任务是一个错误
Our mission was a mistake.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.480
这些人
These people...

01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:22.520
他们不值得拯救
they're not worth saving.

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:24.530
费斯托斯
Oh, Phastos.

01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:26.150
他们不值得拯救
They're not worth saving.

01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:40.090
谢谢　-传过来
- Thanks. - Give me a good one.

01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:41.630
好　-这边
- All right. - Over here.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:42.420
再来…
And...

01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:44.420
太棒了　-耶
Oh, that's great, man! - Yeah! - Yeah!

01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:45.720
耶　-赞
- Oh, yeah! - Nice.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:47.550
漂亮　-不错 准备 接好
Good one. All right, ready? Throw!

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.680
（今日 芝加哥）

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.680
差一点
Oh, so close.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.930
爸比…你看　-好
Daddy, Daddy, watch this. Yeah, okay.

01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:53.060
注意　-传过来…
Watch this. Let me see. Let me see it.

01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.770
爸 我才刚开始学
Dad. I'm only a starter.

01:25:55.930 --> 01:25:56.940
你好
Hi.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.390
你好 有事吗
- Hello. Can we help you?

01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.480
再来
- Throw it again.

01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:02.230
嘿 杰克 班
Hey, Jack. Ben.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.820
你们好 他们是我大学同学
Hey, guys. These are my friends from college.

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:14.200
这是希薇亚和艾萨克 他是艾萨克
Uh, this is Sylvia and, uh, Isaac. That's Isaac.

01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.710
艾萨克　-爸 他是超人
Isaac. Dad, that's Superman.

01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:19.290
爸 他是超人　-杰克 你真搞笑
Dad, that's Superman! Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.420
不 他是超人　-他绝对不是超人
No, no! He is Superman. That is definitely not Superman.

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:25.500
我在电视上看过他 他在伦敦打怪兽
I saw him on TV. He was in London, fighting a monster.

01:26:26.130 --> 01:26:29.550
你穿着披风 眼睛射出激光光
And you were with a cape and you were shooting laser beams out of your eyes.

01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.260
我不穿披风的
- I don't wear a cape.

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:33.680
对不起　-好 我们该进去了
- Oh, sorry. Okay, well, we should just go inside, right?

01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:36.350
能叫你克拉克吗 你现在当超人
Can I call you Clark? Is that what you go by now? Because, you know...

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.140
你叫过我更难听的
You've called me worse.

01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:39.850
你懂了吗 杰克
- You got it, Jack?

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:41.100
这就对了
- Way to go. - Yes.

01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:43.310
是　-好 做给我看
All right. Show me how it's done.

01:26:43.690 --> 01:26:46.280
绕圈圈…
Round and round and round and round and round.

01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:51.490
你会了 继续　-过来
Yep, you got it. Keep going. Come on.

01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:03.210
对 一点也不做作
Yeah. Incredibly natural, guys.

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.050
所以 这么多年过去了
So, after all these years,

01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:10.300
连你也相信艾贾克的谎言
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:11.970
没必要在伤口上洒盐
No need to rub it in.

01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:18.020
她不让我们干涉人类冲突是有道理的
It all makes sense why she wouldn't let us interfere with human conflicts.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.230
冲突引发战争
Conflicts lead to war,

01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:24.980
战争促进科技与医药进步
and war actually leads to advancement in lifesaving technology and medicine.

01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:27.150
我们的任务始终都不是
So our mission was never to

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:30.070
创造一个和平或和谐的世界
make a peaceful or harmonious world,

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:33.990
而是不计代价增加人口
but to increase the population at all costs.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.200
把人类当天神族的食物 对吧
Just farming humans as food for the Celestials, right?

01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:38.370
说得真无情
That's bleak.

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:40.040
告诉你的丈夫和孩子
Well, so is telling your husband and your child

01:27:40.210 --> 01:27:41.790
他们可能在几天内死去也是
that they could be dead within a few days.

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.040
我以为你已经放弃了人类了
Thought you'd given up on humans.

01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:46.750
我很幸运 懂吗
I got lucky. Okay?

01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:51.050
我现在有一个家庭
I have a family now.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:53.550
他们再次给了我信心
They give me faith again.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.720
我每天都在他们身上看到人类的优点
And I see the good in humanity in them every single day.

01:27:58.890 --> 01:28:00.520
听好 我帮不了你们
So, look, I cannot help you.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:01.810
我绝不离开他们　-费斯托斯
I am never leaving them. Phastos...

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:03.060
对不起 瑟希
I'm sorry, Sersi.

01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:04.600
不先考虑后果
It was wrong for me to use my powers

01:28:04.770 --> 01:28:06.690
就使用我的超能力是错的
without thinking about the consequences in the first place.

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:11.610
我选择用双手修理孩子的自行车
So, now, I choose to use my hands to fix my child' bicycle, okay?

01:28:12.150 --> 01:28:13.360
是吗
Do you?

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.620
我不再使用我的超能力了
I don't use my powers anymore.

01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.120
你确定
You sure?

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.120
你…
What are you...

01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:25.040
你有病啊 我的孩子就在隔壁房间
What the hell is wrong with you? My child is right down the hallway!

01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:27.210
那看来像有人一直在使用超能力
That looks like someone's been using his powers.

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:29.590
天啊　-你打造了坚不可摧的藏身处
Oh, my God. I bet you've built the perfect safe house.

01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:31.300
这什么做的 汎合金吗
What is this even made of? - Vibranium?

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:32.090
不要
- Don't!

01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:38.100
秋季系列
Fall collection.

01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.510
IKEA
IKEA.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.680
混蛋
Ass.

01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:43.560
五千多年来你如何忍受这家伙
How did you even deal with this guy for over 5,000 years?

01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:46.310
留在这里 还不如请变异族来吃饭
If you stay here, you might as well invite the Deviants to dinner.

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.020
不用等什么世界末日了
Never mind waiting for the end of the world.

01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:49.440
他说得有道理
He has a point.

01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:52.610
抱歉 你不能突然出现就要我跟你走
No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up in my life and expect me to go with you.

01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:54.780
我不会…　-你应该去 亲爱的
I'm not gonna... You should go, habibi.

01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:56.870
你要我去
You want me to go?

01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:59.830
你知道我妈会怎么对你说吧
You know what my mom would say to you right now, right?

01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:04.040
别拖了 菲尔 好好处理你的事
Quit procrastinating, Phil, and take care of your business.

01:29:04.210 --> 01:29:05.500
他是慢郎中
He's a chronic procrastinator.

01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:07.630
我不会离开你们两个 免谈
I'm not leaving you two. No way.

01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:09.590
我也不乐意
I'm not happy about it,

01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:13.510
但如果有机会看着杰克长大
but if there's a chance for us to watch Jack grow up to live a life of his own,

01:29:13.670 --> 01:29:15.380
我们就该把握
we should take it.

01:29:55.050 --> 01:29:59.260
（伊拉克）

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.560
多摩号
The Domo.

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.230
哇
Wow.

01:30:58.070 --> 01:31:01.160
空气中弥漫着不祥的气氛
A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:04.870
诡异的寂静使我们的肺窒息
An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.

01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:07.620
干嘛 你吓到我们了 知道吧
What are you doing? You know you're creeping us out. You know that, right?

01:31:08.290 --> 01:31:10.710
天啊 拜托冷静
Oh, God! Stay calm, T, please!

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.880
薯片 只是薯片
Chips. It's just chips.

01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:21.470
如你所见 永恒族也有人类的情绪
As you can see, being an Eternal does not preclude you from having human emotions

01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:23.430
比如胆小如鼠
such as cowardice.

01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:27.510
她做了什么
What has she done?

01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:31.350
那是我实验室的石棺吗
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:35.900
这是玛卡瑞 还是该叫她囤积女王
This is Makkari. Or should I say Miss Havisham?

01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:37.780
我们有几世纪没见到她了
None of us have seen her for centuries.

01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:41.740
准备回家了吗
Ready to go home?

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:02.760
那是乌木之刃吗
Is that the Ebony Blade?

01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:04.180
圣剑
Excalibur.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.310
亚瑟一直很煞你
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.060
所以你是说…
So you mean...

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:14.440
我等了几世纪想回奥林匹亚星
I've been waiting for centuries to go back to Olympia,

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.230
现在你却跟我说
and now you're telling me...

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.150
它不存在
...it doesn't exist?

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.570
对 还有世界要毁灭了
That, and the world is ending.

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.360
我的无聊时光终于要结束了
At last my boredom is ending.

01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:27.330
你看过我的电影吗
Have you seen my movies?

01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:30.790
我没有DVD播放机
I don't have a DVD player.

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.120
DVD
DVD?

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.040
现在大家都看串流
It's all about streaming now.

01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:36.130
你需要一台Kindle
You know, what you need is a Kindle.

01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:38.340
知道那是什么吗 就像…
Do you know what that is? It's like a...

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.760
我刚发觉如果你不知道iPad
You know, I just realized that if you don't know what an iPad is,

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.050
几乎没办法解释
there's almost no way to explain it.

01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:52.600
那你最后是如何取得《翠玉录》的
So, how did you end up scoring this Emerald Tablet,

01:32:52.770 --> 01:32:55.690
美丽的玛卡瑞
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

01:32:58.770 --> 01:33:00.150
你想我吗
Miss me?

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.900
请问这怎么回事
I'm sorry, what are we watching? Because this...

01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:05.150
新发展吗 我不喜欢　-你们俩…
Is this new? Because I hate it. Are you two...

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:06.410
费斯托斯
Phastos,

01:33:06.570 --> 01:33:08.280
我得控制一个天神族的意念
I need to control the mind of a Celestial.

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:09.910
好 准备好
Okay, get ready for it.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.330
手环
Bracelets?

01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:15.920
你帮我们做了手环
You made us bracelets?

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.000
以下是天神族的基本介绍
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:21.840
天神族是宇宙中最强大的能量生产者
Celestials are the most powerful energy generators in the universe.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.210
阿里瑟姆创造我们时
When Arishem made us,

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.260
为我们注入了无限的宇宙能量
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy

01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:26.970
使我们身体不断再生
to keep our bodies regenerating.

01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.600
这些手环理论上…
The bracelets, in theory,

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:30.720
会关闭我们的再生过程
shut down our regeneration process.

01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:33.980
于是我们身体会累积额外的宇宙能量
And once that happens, our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy.

01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:35.310
要做什么
What for?

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.270
如果变异族能吸取我们的能量
Well, if the Deviants can absorb our energy,

01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:42.110
要是我们也能吸取彼此的能量呢
what if we can absorb each other's energy as well?

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.780
如果我能设法连结我们所有人
If I can find a way to connect us all,

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.900
我们其中一人就能变得无比强大
one of us could become immensely powerful,

01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:49.780
汇集其他人的累积能量
pulling the accumulated energy from the rest,

01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:51.120
形成…
forming...

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:56.080
一个统一意念
a Uni-Mind.

01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:01.790
统合为一的意念
"Uni" meaning "one," "mind" meaning "mind."

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:02.960
我们第一次就听懂了
Oh, no, we heard you the first time.

01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:04.420
烂名字　-我们脑力激荡…
- Terrible name. - We'll brainstorm...

01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:06.090
「脑力激荡」
"Brainstorm"!

01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:07.760
这名字好多了　-不 是我发明的
That's a way better name! No, I invented it,

01:34:07.930 --> 01:34:08.930
我想叫什么都行
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

01:34:09.090 --> 01:34:13.430
假设诸克能让蒂亚穆睡着
So suppose Druig can, say... put Tiamut to sleep--

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.720
然后呢
Then what?

01:34:14.890 --> 01:34:17.310
我们为人类在另一个星球上找新家
We find humans a new home on another planet.

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:20.310
还要建造大船 每种动物带两只走
Are we building a big ship, too? Take a pair of each animal?

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.860
什么无法拯救世界呢 你的酸言酸语
Well, you know what's never saved the planet? Your sarcasm.

01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:24.860
太空殖民可能花上好几十年
Space colonization could take decades.

01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:26.400
有我们帮助的话会很快
It can happen quickly with our help.

01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:28.990
要是不小心杀死蒂亚穆呢
What if we end up accidentally killing Tiamut?

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.990
我们可能要为全宇宙
We could be responsible for billions of lives

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.910
没创造出来的数十亿生命负责
not being created across the universe.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.410
老大 我说得对吗
Boss, am I right?

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:37.830
说句话 伊卡利斯
Say something, Ikaris.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.670
你认为我们不应该这样做
You don't think we should be doing this.

01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:48.800
艾贾克选择瑟希来领导我们
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:52.140
应该由瑟希决定
Sersi should decide.

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.560
别管艾贾克选了谁
Forget who Ajak chose.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.890
你是最强的 应该由你做这个决定
You're the strongest. You should be making this decision.

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:03.270
好 继续自欺欺人吧
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.820
丝派克
Sprite.

01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:15.200
好 这不是…
Okay, this is not...

01:35:15.370 --> 01:35:16.660
伊卡利斯　-别去追他
Ikaris. Don't run after him.

01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:18.830
金勾 我…你们
Kingo, I... You guys.

01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:21.710
别担心 丝派克总是怪里怪气的
Hey. Don't sweat it. Sprite's always cranky.

01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:23.750
即使她不在 我也常听到她抱怨
I used to hear her complaining even when she wasn't there.

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.250
我没事 金勾
I'm okay, Kingo.

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:27.130
如果你认为该这么做 我相信你
If you think we should do this, I trust you.

01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.970
我会像往常一样一路追随你
I will follow you to the end, like I always have.

01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:33.470
你说什么
What did you say?

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:36.180
我会像往常一样一路追随你
I will follow you to the end, like I always have.

01:35:37.930 --> 01:35:40.810
我不是你以为的那样
I'm not who you think I am.

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:16.140
（六天前 南达科他州）

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.770
我们还有多久时间
How long do we have?

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:22.770
七天
Seven days.

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:24.600
很好
Good.

01:36:26.190 --> 01:36:28.190
我们完成任务了
We completed our mission.

01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:32.570
她在哪
Where is she?

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:33.740
伦敦
London.

01:36:34.570 --> 01:36:36.160
过着美好的生活
She has a good life there.

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.410
我确定她很想你
I'm sure she's missed you.

01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:41.870
如果回到她身边 我就会告诉她真相
If I'd gone back to her, I would only have told her the truth.

01:36:43.710 --> 01:36:45.330
她会很痛苦
She would've suffered

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.000
知道她所爱的世界有一天会毁灭
knowing this world she loves would end one day.

01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:49.340
伊卡利斯
Ikaris.

01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:52.050
我们必须告诉他们真相
We have to tell them the truth.

01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:53.630
什么
What?

01:36:54.010 --> 01:36:55.550
为什么 　-因为同心协力
Why? Because together

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.800
我们也许能阻止神现
we might be able to stop the emergence.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.220
阻止神现
"Stop the emergence"?

01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:01.390
听好
Listen...

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.390
我知道最后很难…　-听我说
Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...Listen to me, Ikaris.

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:06.610
我追随阿里瑟姆数百万年
I have followed Arishem for millions of years.

01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:09.400
从来没有怀疑过他
And I have never doubted him.

01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:11.230
直到现在　-为什么是现在
Until now. Why now?

01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:13.570
为什么是现在
Why now?

01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:23.080
五年前 萨诺斯消灭了宇宙一半人口
Five years ago, Thanos erased half of the population of the universe.

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:26.370
造成神现延宕
Delayed the emergence.

01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:30.380
但这个星球的人…
But the people of this planet

01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:33.800
一弹指就把所有人救回来
brought everyone back with the snap of a finger.

01:37:35.010 --> 01:37:38.140
在我让你们离开后
You know, after I let you all go,

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:41.180
我周游世界 生活在地球人之间
I traveled the world, living among them.

01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:44.930
见过他们互斗、撒谎和杀戮
I have seen them fight and lie and kill,

01:37:45.230 --> 01:37:47.560
但我也见到他们
but I have also seen them

01:37:47.730 --> 01:37:50.150
欢笑与相爱
laugh and love.

01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:54.320
我见到他们创造和梦想
I've seen them create and dream.

01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:58.910
这个星球
This planet

01:37:59.570 --> 01:38:01.160
以及这些人
and these people...

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.290
改变了我
have changed me.

01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:09.920
阿里瑟姆设计的代价 不值得
The cost of Arishem's design, it's not worth it.

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.710
这次不值得
Not this time.

01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:15.260
我相信你 艾贾克
I trust you, Ajak.

01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:21.350
我会像往常一样
I'll follow you to the end,

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.180
一路追随你
as I always have.

01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:25.730
谢谢
Thank you.

01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:29.310
我们必须让所有人再度聚首
We have to bring everyone back together.

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:34.280
我得先给你看一样东西
There's something I have to show you first.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.360
（阿拉斯加州）

01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:46.580
就在前面
It's just up ahead.

01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:56.590
它们一定困在冰里好几世纪
They must have been trapped in the ice for centuries

01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.680
上周地核因神现而升温
and broke free last week when the glacier started to melt

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.550
冰川融化 它们才挣脱而出
as the Earth's core heats up for the emergence.

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.100
它们杀光整家钻油公司的工人
They killed an entire company of oil workers.

01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:08.520
我追踪它们到这里
I tracked them here.

01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:14.360
我怀疑你可能改变了主意
I suspected you might have changed your mind.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.570
我不能让你背叛阿里瑟姆
I can't let you betray Arishem.

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:21.360
你何不亲手杀了我
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:24.530
等其他人意识到地球出事了
When the others realize something is happening to the Earth,

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.370
他们会来找你
they'll come to you.

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.410
等他们发现你的尸体
When they find your body,

01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:29.960
就知道变异族回来了
they'll know the Deviants are back.

01:39:30.370 --> 01:39:33.040
那会让他们忙到神现为止
It'll keep them busy until the emergence.

01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:37.090
我一直对你忠心耿耿 艾贾克
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:39.880
保守你的秘密几世纪
Kept your secret for centuries,

01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:42.970
欺骗我在乎的所有人
lied to everyone I cared about,

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:47.770
但从未怀疑我为天神族效力的使命
but never have I doubted my purpose to serve the Celestials.

01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:50.390
伊卡利斯
Oh, Ikaris.

01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:58.150
我把你带上错误的路
I've led you down the wrong path.

01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.360
这是我所知唯一的路
It's the only path I know.

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:56.080
我就想会在这里找到你
Thought I'd find you here.

01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:59.000
我常想到这个地方
I've thought about this place a lot.

01:43:00.210 --> 01:43:02.540
世事的变化真惊人
Amazing how things change over time.

01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:05.250
也许改变的是我们
Maybe we're the ones who've changed.

01:43:08.090 --> 01:43:09.970
我知道你不赞同我们的计划
I know you don't agree with our plan.

01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:14.100
我一直认为天神族就像海洋
I've always thought of the Celestials like the ocean.

01:43:15.930 --> 01:43:19.440
他们毫无偏见地赋予与夺取生命
They give life and they take life away without bias.

01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:22.560
如果他们走了 宇宙末日终将来临
If they were gone, this universe would eventually end.

01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:25.480
你想做的是让人类脱离自然秩序
What you're trying to do is free humanity from the natural order.

01:43:25.650 --> 01:43:29.490
让整个星球的生命灭绝并不自然
It's not natural to allow all life on an entire planet to be destroyed.

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.950
阿里瑟姆的方法过时又暴力
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:34.080
我不想吵架 瑟希
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:35.870
这一切很快就会结束
It'll all end soon.

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.870
只是没有尽头 是吗
Except there is no end, is there?

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.620
我们会继续前进 没有记忆
We'd carry on without our memories

01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:43.330
没有自由意志
or free will

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.090
永远这样下去
for eternity.

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.180
你怕了
You're afraid.

01:43:52.590 --> 01:43:55.220
我不介意离开这个世界
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:57.890
我只愿当我们离开时
I only wish that when we do,

01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.730
我能记得你
I would be able to remember you.

01:44:03.810 --> 01:44:06.270
我爱上你了 瑟希
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

01:44:06.730 --> 01:44:09.650
我很感激与你共度的岁月
I'm grateful for the life I've lived with you.

01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:16.910
伊卡利斯
Ikaris.

01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:43.060
瑟希
Sersi?

01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:48.520
开始了
It's started.

01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:53.660
不 天啊
Oh, no. My God.

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.240
统一意念呢
What about the Uni-Mind?

01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:58.450
我还没想出连结我们的办法 但快了
I haven't figured out a way to connect us, but I'm close.

01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:00.160
就差一点点　-还要多久
- I'm very, very close. - How much longer?

01:45:00.330 --> 01:45:02.330
我不知道 瑟希
I don't know, Sersi!

01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:06.880
找到神现点
Find the point of emergence.

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:33.360
你一直都知道末日将临
You always knew the end was coming.

01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:36.160
那一定是种解脱
It must be a relief.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.320
那个变异族还在追踪我们
That Deviant is still tracking us.

01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:41.580
复仇不会给你平静 圣娜
Revenge won't bring peace for you, Thena.

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.290
但杀死它却可以
But killing it might.

01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:58.800
伊卡利斯
Ikaris?

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.680
你在做什么
What are you doing?

01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:10.270
我希望你平静地离开这个世界
I wanted you to leave this world in peace.

01:46:11.650 --> 01:46:14.070
对神现浑然不知
Without knowing about the emergence.

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:16.030
但我失败了
But I failed.

01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:21.580
真希望艾贾克没有选择你
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:30.130
我就快完成了
I'm close to figuring it out.

01:46:34.630 --> 01:46:35.920
老大 你在做什么
Boss, what are you doing?

01:46:36.090 --> 01:46:37.590
我让这件事拖够久了
I've let this go on long enough.

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:38.680
不要伤害他
Don't hurt him!

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.390
他骗我们
He lied to us.

01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:45.020
他早已知道神现的事
He already knew about the emergence.

01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:47.060
不 他不知道
No, he didn't.

01:46:47.230 --> 01:46:49.940
离开巴比伦时 艾贾克全告诉我了
Ajak told me everything when we left Babylon.

01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:52.320
什么
What?

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:55.690
你根本不打算让我们阻止神现
You were never gonna let us stop the emergence.

01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:56.860
没错
No.

01:46:58.150 --> 01:47:00.820
我只想保护你们不受变异族侵害
I only wanted to protect you from the Deviants.

01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:04.290
艾贾克若要你接替她 为何选了我
If Ajak wanted you to take her place, why did she choose me?

01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:10.670
你做了什么
What have you done?

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.630
他杀了她
He killed her.

01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:17.380
我是不得已的
I had to.

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.680
她爱你啊
She loved you.

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:25.140
是吗 　-她爱你
- Did she? - She loved you.

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.850
你认为接受真相很容易吗
Do you think it was easy to live with the truth?

01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:32.860
知道有一天这一切都会结束
To know that one day all this would end?

01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:37.360
继续骗你们
To keep on lying to you?

01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.910
如果我们给人类选择
If we gave humanity the choice,

01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:43.370
他们多少人愿意死
how many of them would be willing to die

01:47:43.530 --> 01:47:46.160
好让数十亿人诞生
so that billions more could be born?

01:47:46.330 --> 01:47:48.710
我们不会给他们选择
We're not giving them a choice.

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:52.830
这就是你愿意杀人的原因吗
Is this why you're willing to kill?

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:56.500
你真可悲
You are so pathetic!

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:59.220
我是永恒族 费斯托斯
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.890
我为阿里瑟姆而存在
I exist for Arishem.

01:48:03.050 --> 01:48:04.300
你也一样
As do you.

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:05.810
那是你的本质
It's who you are.

01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:10.640
我完全不会改变自己的本质
I wouldn't change a single thing about who I am.

01:48:10.810 --> 01:48:12.770
无论先天或后天
Born or made.

01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:15.190
但我不是为了阿里瑟姆而存在
But I do not exist for Arishem,

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:17.320
而是为我家人
I exist for my family!

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.940
那么你犯了和艾贾克一样的错误
Then you are making the same mistake Ajak did.

01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.820
我找到蒂亚穆了
I found Tiamut.

01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:24.200
不　-玛卡瑞
- No! - Makkari!

01:48:26.530 --> 01:48:27.990
快离开
Get out of here!

01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:32.420
金勾
Kingo.

01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:42.930
你不能背叛你的家人
You do not turn against your family.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:46.220
吉尔伽美什因你而死
Gilgamesh died because of you.

01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:49.600
你们对付不了我
You won't succeed against me.

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:53.190
有必要的话 我会杀光你们
And I will kill every one of you if I have to.

01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:02.070
等等
Wait.

01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:04.070
我跟你走
I'm going with you.

01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:05.280
丝派克
Sprite...

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.120
怎么了
What is this?

01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:23.800
丝派克为什么跟伊卡利斯走
Why did Sprite go with Ikaris?

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.470
因为她爱他
Because she loves him.

01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:31.720
你们没注意到吗
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

01:49:32.890 --> 01:49:35.060
他把我们耍得团团转
He really fooled us, didn't he?

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.230
卡伦 我们走
Karun, let's go.

01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:38.980
等等 你想去哪里
Wait, where the hell are you going?

01:49:39.150 --> 01:49:41.070
我帮不了你们
I can't help you guys.

01:49:42.110 --> 01:49:43.740
我还是认为伊卡利斯是对的
I still think Ikaris is right.

01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:46.950
就这样 你要跟他走
So, that's it, huh? Just gonna follow him?

01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:49.740
我爱这个星球上的人
I love the people of this planet.

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.500
但如果你们阻止神现
But if you stop this emergence,

01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:55.040
就会妨碍其他许多类似的世界
you are preventing so many other worlds like this one

01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:56.790
被创造出来
from being created.

01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:59.340
我依然相信阿里瑟姆
I still have faith in Arishem.

01:49:59.790 --> 01:50:02.960
但不愿为我的信仰伤害你们任何人
But I refuse to hurt any of you for my beliefs.

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:08.760
我们需要你
We need you.

01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:11.510
即使有我帮忙 我们也不是对手
Even with my help, we're no match.

01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:13.930
那是伊卡利斯
It's Ikaris.

01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:18.310
但…
But...

01:50:19.110 --> 01:50:20.980
希望在下一个星球见到你们
I hope to see you on the next planet.

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.910
谢谢你们为了人类…
Thank you for all you've done...

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.240
所做的一切
...for humanity.

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.000
十分荣幸认识你们
It's been a great honor.

01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:39.540
我会想念你们大家的
I will miss you all.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:49.640
听着
Look,

01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:53.350
就算要在对抗伊卡利斯时丧命
if I'm gonna get myself killed going up against Ikaris,

01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:56.020
我们也需要一个备案
we'll need to have a backup plan.

01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:57.890
我们所有的力量即使增强
All of our powers, even if they're amplified,

01:50:58.060 --> 01:50:59.440
都不足以杀死一个天神族
are not enough to kill a Celestial, so...

01:50:59.610 --> 01:51:02.150
瑟希把一个变异族变成一棵树
Well, Sersi did turn a Deviant into a tree.

01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:04.280
你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.400
你不打算告诉我吗
You didn't wanna tell me that?

01:51:06.570 --> 01:51:08.280
你以前根本做不到
You've never been able to do it before.

01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:09.860
我不知道怎么发生的
I don't know how it happened, okay?

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:12.450
也很确定我无法再做到
And I'm pretty sure I couldn't do it again.

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:15.160
你不觉得现在该试试吗
Well, now is the time to try, don't you think?

01:51:15.330 --> 01:51:17.290
费斯托斯 那个变异族死了
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:20.670
我们计划让蒂亚穆睡着 不是杀了它
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep, not to kill it.

01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:22.210
我不能杀死天神族
I can't kill a Celestial.

01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:24.000
瑟希
Sersi. Sersi.

01:51:24.170 --> 01:51:25.550
我们不能
We can't!

01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:32.640
我们不能
We can't.

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:34.350
没关系 瑟希
It's okay, Sersi.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:37.060
让我来处理
I got this.

01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:54.910
没时间懊悔了
There's no time for that.

01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:58.790
我没看到谎言就在面前
I didn't see the lies right in front of me.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.960
甚至不知道艾贾克为何选我来领导
I'm not even sure why Ajak chose me to lead.

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.050
我曾问过吉尔伽美什
I asked Gilgamesh once

01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:08.880
他为什么选择保护我
why he chose to protect me.

01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:10.720
他说
He said,

01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:14.510
「当你深爱一样东西 就会保护它
"When you love something, you protect it.

01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:19.850
那是世界上最自然的事」
"It is the most natural thing in the world."

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:27.070
从我们抵达那天起 你就爱着这些人
You have loved these people since the day we arrived.

01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:33.910
所以现在没人比你更适合领导我们
So, there is no one better to lead us now than you.

01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:37.700
瑟希
Sersi.

01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:41.290
起来
Get up.

01:52:49.210 --> 01:52:51.680
艾贾克选择你是有原因的
Ajak chose you for a reason.

01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:57.890
瑟希
Sersi!

01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:59.390
瑟希
Sersi!

01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:01.140
瑟希 我们需要你
Oh, Sersi. We need you!

01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:02.850
我已经讲了那段话
I already gave that speech.

01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:04.060
什么
What?

01:53:04.230 --> 01:53:05.480
你…什么…
You did... What...

01:53:05.650 --> 01:53:08.650
瑟希 你体内的那颗球
Sersi, the sphere inside of you,

01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:10.360
在你和阿里瑟姆之间建立了连结
it creates a connection between you and Arishem.

01:53:10.530 --> 01:53:13.660
也许我能重新运用它
Maybe I can repurpose it

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.070
建立连结 在…
and create a connection between, uh,

01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:17.580
我们所有人之间
well, all of us.

01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:20.330
那可以触发统一意念
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

01:53:20.490 --> 01:53:22.160
太好了　-是啊
Great. Yeah.

01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:24.120
但是…
But, um...

01:53:25.170 --> 01:53:27.000
我得从你身上把它取出来
I have to take it out of you.

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:31.130
好
Okay.

01:53:32.630 --> 01:53:33.720
动手吧
Do it.

01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:36.470
好
Okay.

01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:46.060
不要害死她
Don't kill her.

01:53:46.230 --> 01:53:47.440
圣娜
Thena...

01:53:48.690 --> 01:53:49.730
动手
Do it.

01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:04.710
有用吗
Will it work?

01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:10.840
非成功不可
It has to.

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:04.430
很高兴你在这里
I'm glad you're here.

01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:10.230
谢谢你 丝派克
Thank you, Sprite.

01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:26.750
保护神现
Protect the emergence.

01:55:26.910 --> 01:55:28.670
你真的要杀了他们
You're really gonna kill them?

01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:38.050
诸克在哪里
Where's Druig?

01:55:38.590 --> 01:55:39.800
他在忙
He's busy.

01:55:39.970 --> 01:55:42.050
圣娜 别冲动
Thena, play nice.

01:55:45.850 --> 01:55:47.270
你向来不必对抗我
You've never had to fight me.

01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:48.560
但我想很久了
But I've always wanted to.

01:55:56.980 --> 01:55:59.200
是该让神安眠了
It's time to put a god to sleep.

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:08.470
我五个世纪前就该这么做
I should've done this five centuries ago.

01:57:55.810 --> 01:57:57.310
诸克死了
Druig's gone.

01:57:58.230 --> 01:57:59.610
结束了
It's over.

01:59:07.130 --> 01:59:07.970
费斯托斯
Phastos.

01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:14.180
我必须设法阻止
I have to try and stop this.

01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:16.100
我得更靠近蒂亚穆
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:18.060
牵制伊卡利斯　-我们掩护你
Keep Ikaris busy. We've got you.

01:59:18.230 --> 01:59:19.230
去吧
Go.

01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.820
够了
Enough.

01:59:59.190 --> 02:00:00.440
圣娜 住手
Thena, stop!

02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:33.930
为何要帮伊卡利斯
Why are you helping Ikaris?

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.180
不能让它吸取我们的力量
We can't let it absorb our powers.

02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:38.640
为时已晚
Too late.

02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:42.940
圣娜 它想激怒你 不要…
Thena, he's trying to goad you. Don't...

02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:59.830
玛卡瑞
Makkari!

02:01:09.010 --> 02:01:10.220
瑟希呢
Where's Sersi?

02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:12.760
你总是低估她
You always did underestimate her.

02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:15.470
想得美
Oh, no.

02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:17.930
别急
Not so fast.

02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:23.770
老大
Boss.

02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:30.820
不知道你怎么想 感觉很爽吧
I don't know about you, but this is really satisfying, right?

02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:33.320
放开我 费斯托斯 我不能让她动手
Let me go, Phastos! I can't let her do this!

02:01:33.490 --> 02:01:34.780
我不认同
I don't think so.

02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.660
我早就想折损你的威力了 伊卡利斯
I've been wanting to clip your wings for a long time, Ikaris!

02:01:51.970 --> 02:01:52.970
圣娜
Thena.

02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:58.600
你变了
Oh, you've changed.

02:01:59.970 --> 02:02:01.600
你败坏了
You're broken.

02:02:02.430 --> 02:02:03.940
受损
Damaged.

02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:06.350
废了
Useless.

02:02:08.610 --> 02:02:12.440
你无法保护他们任何一个
You can't protect any of them.

02:02:26.370 --> 02:02:27.750
瑟希
Sersi.

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:35.420
你力量不够强 做不到
You're not powerful enough to do this.

02:02:35.590 --> 02:02:37.510
你也不会
And you won't.

02:02:37.930 --> 02:02:39.680
你不是杀手
You're not a killer.

02:02:39.850 --> 02:02:41.430
也许我变了
Maybe I've changed.

02:02:41.890 --> 02:02:44.390
这是真正的你吗 丝派克
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:47.190
你真愿意让这星球的人死光吗
Are you really willing to let everyone on this planet die?

02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:57.780
对不起 瑟希
I'm sorry, Sersi.

02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:12.460
我一直很羡慕你 瑟希
I've always envied you, Sersi.

02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:16.590
你能变成他们继续生活
'Cause you get to live as one of them.

02:03:17.130 --> 02:03:18.220
而我永远做不到
And I never could.

02:03:19.470 --> 02:03:21.720
知道我为何讨厌和人类一起生活吗
You know why I hated living with humans?

02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:25.100
他们让我想起我不知道自己要的东西
Because they reminded me of things I didn't even know I wanted.

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:28.980
因为他们 现在我想知道长大的感觉
Because of them, now I wanna know what it feels like to grow up.

02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:31.810
恋爱的滋味
To fall in love.

02:03:32.610 --> 02:03:34.230
拥有家庭的感觉
To have a family.

02:03:35.530 --> 02:03:39.200
最后知道自己活过
And to know, in the end, I've lived.

02:03:46.330 --> 02:03:47.450
现在都结束了
It's all over now.

02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:50.630
我们可以在新的地方重新开始
We get to start over somewhere new.

02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:56.170
好感人的真心话
Well, that was very moving.

02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:57.590
诸克
Druig.

02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:04.850
我做不到
I can't do this.

02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.400
现在这是你的战争了
This is your fight now.

02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:56.190
圣娜
Thena.

02:04:57.570 --> 02:04:58.820
是我
It's me.

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:00.570
吉尔伽美什
Gilgamesh.

02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:03.030
看着我
Look at me.

02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:05.370
吉尔伽美什
Gilgamesh?

02:05:05.530 --> 02:05:07.080
留在这里
Stay here.

02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:11.040
说吧
Say it.

02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:13.250
留下
Stay here.

02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:15.840
你会没事的
You'll be okay.

02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:19.710
把你的手给我
Give me your hand.

02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:34.230
真可惜
Ah, it's a shame.

02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:37.900
你和我
You and I,

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:40.400
我们只是一个神的工具
we're just tools of a god.

02:05:41.780 --> 02:05:44.990
为杀戮而生
Built to kill.

02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:49.080
圣娜
Thena.

02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:53.920
记住
Remember.

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:25.990
我记得
I remember.

02:07:55.290 --> 02:07:56.750
快啊 瑟希
Come on, Sersi.

02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:58.870
快点
Come on.

02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:09.800
很美吧
It's beautiful, isn't it?

02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:40.490
对不起
I'm sorry.

02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:43.660
我知道
I know.

02:13:59.230 --> 02:14:00.280
怎么做
How?

02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:02.110
你怎么做到的
How did you do it?

02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:04.660
碰触蒂亚穆的手掌时
When I touched Tiamut's palm,

02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:06.490
我感觉能量涌入体内
I felt energy surging into me.

02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:09.290
蒂亚穆加入了我们的统一意念
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

02:14:09.450 --> 02:14:10.790
我一直在想
I always wondered how we survived

02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:13.620
我们如何在其他星球毁灭后存活
the destruction of other planets that we were on.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.500
就是在天神族出现时与其连结
By being connected to the Celestial as it emerged.

02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:32.060
我们合而为一
We became one...

02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:36.980
甚至包括伊卡利斯和丝派克
...even Ikaris and Sprite

02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:43.190
都是因为蒂亚穆
all because of Tiamut.

02:15:20.230 --> 02:15:21.440
他走了吗
Is he gone?

02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:32.370
丝派克
Sprite.

02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:37.460
我还有来自统一意念的能量
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:40.590
我能让你成为人类
I think I can make you human.

02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:44.880
你想要的一切都可以拥有
All the things you said you wanted, you can have them.

02:15:45.050 --> 02:15:47.930
但你的时间稍纵即逝 有一天你会死
But your time will be fleeting and you'll die one day.

02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:49.140
你准备好了吗
Are you ready for that?

02:15:51.550 --> 02:15:52.970
准备好了
I am.

02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:32.510
印度洋上突然冒出一个庞然巨石
The sudden appearance of an enormous stone figure in the Indian Ocean

02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:34.010
（两周后 南达科他州）

02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:36.980
给当局留下的问题比答案多
has left more questions than answers for authorities.

02:16:37.850 --> 02:16:41.350
美国和澳大利亚海军舰艇维持防御阵势
U.S. and Australian naval ships are maintaining defensive positions,

02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:42.520
但在这个…
but at this...

02:16:42.690 --> 02:16:44.570
那是你们干的
You guys did that?

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:47.650
我真的好爱你
I love you so much.

02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:56.330
你还好吗
Are you okay?

02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:59.250
我有时会搞混
I get confused sometimes.

02:16:59.410 --> 02:17:01.460
我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:06.340
爸说你是雅典娜女神
So, Dad said you're the goddess Athena.

02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:08.590
圣娜 差两个字
"Thena." Drop the "A."

02:17:11.510 --> 02:17:13.340
你有什么超能力
What's your superpower?

02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:19.480
麻烦…等一下
Um, can you just... Look... One second.

02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:21.850
好
Okay. All right.

02:17:22.390 --> 02:17:24.110
那东西…好
See, that thing is... Okay.

02:17:24.270 --> 02:17:25.770
她差点伤到你 是吧
Almost gave you a shave and a haircut, didn't she?

02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:27.400
站在我后面
Stand behind me, actually.

02:17:27.570 --> 02:17:29.530
记得怎么摀耳朵吗
Um, you remember earmuffs?

02:17:29.690 --> 02:17:31.400
谢谢你
Remember how we practiced earmuffs? Thank you so much.

02:17:33.570 --> 02:17:36.280
你打死都不准当保母了
You know that your babysitting privileges are completely revoked, right?

02:17:36.450 --> 02:17:37.490
别靠近小孩子
Like, it's done.

02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:39.870
谢谢 暴力…
Thank you. Violence... Hey.

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:42.870
暴力绝对不是答案 对吧 圣娜
Violence is never the answer.  Right, T?

02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:45.670
一定要用大脑
You gotta always use your brain, hmm?

02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:47.550
像你在沙滩上开打那样
Like you did fighting on the beach?

02:17:47.710 --> 02:17:48.960
你老爸…
Your dad

02:17:49.130 --> 02:17:51.510
冷静而坚定地对坏人晓以大义
spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy and he had no choice

02:17:51.670 --> 02:17:53.180
他别无选择只能听我的 所以没暴力
but to listen to me, so no violence.

02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:54.680
这孩子十岁了
The kid is ten...

02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:56.640
不是笨蛋
...not stupid!

02:17:57.260 --> 02:17:58.770
你们何时走人
When are you guys leaving? When is that happening?

02:17:58.930 --> 02:18:00.810
快了吧
That's happening soon, right?

02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:03.810
诸克来了 别靠近他
Ah, yes, there's Druig.  Don't go anywhere near him.

02:18:04.350 --> 02:18:05.480
好
Yeah!

02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:09.230
杰克 到这边就好
Okay, that's far enough, Jack.

02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:11.740
爸 多摩号超酷的
Wow, Dad, the Domo's so cool.

02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:13.530
老爸徒手把它修好的
Your dad fixed that with his bare hands.

02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:15.280
我们有一天也能上太空吗
Can we go to space, too, one day?

02:18:15.450 --> 02:18:17.950
等你拿到学习驾照再说
Let's wait till you get your learner's permit, okay?

02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:20.250
费斯托斯
Hey, Phastos.

02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:22.450
保重了
Take care.

02:18:22.830 --> 02:18:24.410
这个世界有你真幸运
This world is lucky to have you.

02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:26.880
谢谢
Thank you.

02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:28.710
我知道你不喜欢拥抱
I know you're not a hugger, so...

02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:32.970
好
Okay.

02:18:35.930 --> 02:18:40.010
你认为等我们找到其他永恒族
You think when we find the other Eternals out there,

02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:43.180
他们会像我们一样接受真相吗
that they'll accept the truth the way we did?

02:18:45.310 --> 02:18:49.070
因为真相会让他们自由
...because the truth will set them free.

02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:02.790
我就说那玩意会上瘾
Told you that thing was addictive.

02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:05.000
记得来找我哦
Please visit?

02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:06.830
我尽量
I'll try.

02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:08.750
放学后有空的话
When I get time off from school.

02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:11.590
哇 待在人类环境中对你有好处
Oh, wow. Listen, it's gonna be good for you to be in a human environment.

02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:13.550
你会学到一些社交技巧
You'll pick up some social skills.

02:19:14.090 --> 02:19:15.470
你认为你不需要吗
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:18.850
这也难怪
That explains so much.

02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:30.110
我会想你的
Gonna miss you.

02:19:30.650 --> 02:19:31.860
我也会
Me, too.

02:19:35.530 --> 02:19:36.650
小姐
Madam.

02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:38.410
谢谢你 卡伦
Thanks, Karun.

02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:41.450
有时在想我们是否做对了
Sometimes I wonder if we did the right thing.

02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:44.160
杀死蒂亚穆
Killing Tiamut.

02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:46.080
后悔也来不及了
It's too late for that.

02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:48.210
但你是跟着感觉走
But you followed your heart.

02:19:48.370 --> 02:19:49.830
我们都是
We all did.

02:19:52.050 --> 02:19:53.050
连伊卡利斯也是
Even Ikaris.

02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.600
看来有人在等你
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:05.890
他本人帅多了
He's a lot cuter in person.

02:20:08.310 --> 02:20:11.520
现在你还不能把我变长颈鹿吗
So, after all that, you still can't change me into a giraffe?

02:20:12.190 --> 02:20:15.860
下次在神现时与天神族连结
Well, I could next time I'm connected to a Celestial

02:20:16.030 --> 02:20:18.240
并执行统一意念时就可以
during an emergence whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:21.200
听上去是不行
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:26.580
现在你怎么办
What'll you do now?

02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:28.040
不确定
Not sure.

02:20:28.210 --> 02:20:30.210
这个星球是我的家 但是…
This planet's my home, but...

02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:34.670
我不能再假装成人类了
I can't pretend to be human anymore.

02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:42.850
我爱你 瑟希
I love you, Sersi.

02:20:44.390 --> 02:20:45.470
不管你是什么
I don't care what you are.

02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:01.910
记得我们说过不再有秘密吗
Remember when we talked about no more secrets?

02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:05.080
我没有秘密了 我保证
I have no more secrets, I promise.

02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:06.740
其实
Actually,

02:21:06.910 --> 02:21:09.210
我有个秘密想告诉你
I have one I want to tell you.

02:21:10.290 --> 02:21:11.830
什么
What is it?

02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:16.300
原来我的家族史…
It turns out my family history is...

02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:18.800
很复杂
complicated.

02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:23.590
瑟希
Sersi?

02:21:24.390 --> 02:21:25.890
瑟希 怎么了
Sersi, what's wrong?

02:21:27.350 --> 02:21:28.680
瑟希
Sersi?

02:21:52.500 --> 02:21:53.880
瑟希
Sersi?

02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:56.000
瑟希
Sersi?

02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:59.050
瑟希
Sersi!

02:22:13.850 --> 02:22:17.230
你选择牺牲一个天神族
You have chosen to sacrifice a Celestial

02:22:17.610 --> 02:22:20.030
为了这个星球的人
for the people of this planet.

02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:23.110
我会饶了他们
I will spare them,

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:27.990
但你的记忆会显示他们是否值得活
but your memories will show if they are worthy to live.

02:22:29.490 --> 02:22:33.710
我会回来进行审判
And I will return for judgment.

02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:51.140
你还好吗 泰德
You all right, Ted?

02:22:52.850 --> 02:22:54.730
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

02:24:39.710 --> 02:24:44.710
（胡迪尼 亲自登台）

02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:41.480
永恒族

02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:56.280
已经好几个星期了
It's been weeks.

02:25:56.450 --> 02:25:59.250
我们没有他们任何人的消息
We haven't heard from any of them.

02:25:59.950 --> 02:26:01.410
就好像…
It's like...

02:26:01.580 --> 02:26:02.540
他们消失了
they've disappeared.

02:26:04.330 --> 02:26:05.670
阿里瑟姆
Arishem.

02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:09.630
我们必须回去
We have to go back.

02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:20.430
我也感觉到了
I feel it, too.

02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:23.940
怎么了
What?

02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:37.910
哇
Wow.

02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:41.410
我的耳朵和眼睛都麻掉了
Aah! My ears. My eyes are numb.

02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:44.420
不再为你们酒醉瞬间移动了
No more drunk teleporting for you.

02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:46.920
等一下…
Hang on, hang on.

02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:54.260

你不必每次都来全套的

02:27:26.330 --> 02:27:27.330
全都要讲一遍　-我知道
What am I gonna leave off the list? No, I know it's impressive.

你们想干什么
What do you want, lads?

02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:40.430
皮普和我是来帮忙的 对不对
Pip and I are here to help, aren't we?

02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:47.980
你们的朋友麻烦大了
Your friends are in big trouble.

02:27:49.650 --> 02:27:51.730
